It looks at the effects that macro-level institutions and contexts have on citizen behaviour, along with how political institutions and the environment where citizens form opinions and act, help in moderating the effects of individual-level factors on citizen behaviour. The modelling structures and behaviour, effects of structures on voter behaviour, and the interactions of structures and behaviour in research on economic voting are some of the topics covered in the article.\n\n**Outline:**\n\n-   **Does x cause behaviour y? It depends!**\n\n    1.  **Example: Does institutional performance affect people's sense of whether their political system is legitimate?**\n        -   **Answer: The impact of corruption on system support is conditional on whether citizens are supporters of the incumbent government.**\n    2.  **Studies are getting better at using institutions and context to predict the effects of citizen behaviour.**\n\n-   Comparative study of structures and behaviour = citizens in context \n\n-   Context and behaviour intimately connected by:\n\n    1.  Formal and informal rules; people's preferences, attitudes, and behaviour affect the establishment and functioning of rules\n    2.  Citizens are exposed to variable social, political, and economic environments that they are supposed to understand, interpret, and sometimes shape\n\n-   Advances in surveys, replication, and computing have allowed for cross-national and multi-level research into behaviour\n\n-   1980s and 1990s renewed focus on institutional questions across polysci that could be tested, as well as interest in developing contextual theories of political behaviour\n\n-   Comparative study of behaviour politics has investigated macro-level contexts/structures:\n\n    1.  Institutions\n\n    2.  Structural conditions\n\n-   Interaction between structures and behaviour presumes several things:\n\n    1.  Politics is about the interaction of people's values and the rules and conditions that govern the implementation of those values\n    2.  The rules and realities in which citizens make choices are themselves a function of people's values\n        -   \"Put another way: contexts are critical for understanding the decisions people make because they affect different people differently, and people's decisions, in turn, shape the nature, shape, and stability of these contexts\" (678).\n\n-   Common approach assumes that context shapes behaviour; assumes behaviour to be DV and that it is exogenous and stable\n\n    1.  Do institutions have direct effects on behaviour?\n\n        -   Voting example: structures can affect voters directly, indirectly, and interactively (or contingently)\n            -   Direct: rational choice theory; individuals weigh costs and benefits of voting and act accordingly\n            -   Indirect: behaviours of elites within electoral rules empower or constrain citizen choices; structures have consequences but these consequences have secondary (or indirect) effects on behaviour\n            -   Contingent: effect of some structural feature strengthened or weakened, depending on presence of some 3rd variable; the turnout gap between individuals with many and few resources is particularly pronounced in countries where the cost of voting is high\n\n{INSERT PHOTO HERE}\n\n-   Recent studies have looked at how the nature of a country's representative structures interacts with the willingness of voters to punish governments for bad economic performance\n    1.  Bad economy impact hinges on ability of voters to hold gov't responsible\n    2.  Institutions can hamper this ability of voters to reward or punish gov'ts\n    3.  Clarity of responsibility also varies over time within (and across) countries b/c of election outcomes that change bargaining power and reshape context\n    4.  Also contingent upon credible alternatives for voters to vote into office\n-   Interactions of vote choice and structures in research on legitimacy\n    1.  What role do institutions play in moderating sense of loss or victory citizens feel?\n\n        -   Institutions shape the responses of winners and losers; citizen attitudes toward democratic institutions shaped by country's political context\n-   \"At the end of the day, what is particularly noteworthy about cross-level investigations of behavioural politics is that they hold the promise of producing a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of political life by connected hitherto unconnected streams of scholarship in the areas of institutions, political economy, policy, and behaviour and allowing us a better and more complex empirical and theoretical handle on the hows and whys of citizen politics\" (690).\n\n## [Chong, Dennis. 2013. \"Degrees of Rationality in Politics.\" Ch. 4 in Leonie Huddy, David O.

Arnold A. Rogow, cited p.482).  \n\n### KEY ARGUMENT:\n\nFollowing evidence and psychological research on personality traits of  different society's strata, Lipset posits that the lower strata are predisposed to support  authoritarianism due to a lack of \"sophistication\" and facing economic and psychological  insecurity. The lower class will support economic liberalism but not political liberalism, while the  middle and upper class will support political liberalism. Hence, according to Lipset, there is a  natural link between the lower-class attitudes and their support of Communism. \n\n-Pre-1914: working-class supported both economic and political liberalism \n\n-Post-1914: \"The intransigent, intolerant, and demonological aspects of Communist ideology attract members from the lower class of low-income, low-status occupations, and little education\" (483).\n\n### DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND STRATIFICATION:\n\n• \"Leftism/economic liberalism associated with socio-economic status\" (485). • \"Psychologically oriented investigators have studied the social correlates of authoritarian  personality structures as measured by the now famous F scale\"(Adorno, 1950, cited p.  486). \n\n• Even in conservatism, economic status predicts tolerance levels (see Eysenck, 1956 and  Stouffer, 1955, cited p.486)\n\n### AUTHORITARIAN RELIGION AND STRATIFICATION:\n\n• Fundamentalist and chiliastic/millennial religious tradition as a predisposition for drastic  and rapid measures demanding authoritarian order. \n\n• The appeal of fundamentalism to the lower class acts as a pressure valve in a utopian world  where the upper class no longer dominates. \n\n• See Engels and his take on evangelism (488). \n\n### TYPICAL SOCIAL SITUATION OF LOWER-CLASS PERSON\n\n-   \"There is consistent evidence that degree of formal education, itself closely correlated with  social and economic status, is also highly correlated with undemocratic attitudes\" (489). • Education predicts attitudes better than occupation (Morris Janowitz and Dwaine Marvick study, cited pp.489-490). \n\n-   Principal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  \"sophistication,\" economic security, and psychological security -\\> mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = \"surviving\"  \n\n### THE PERSPECTIVES OF LOWER-CLASS GROUPS\n\n-   Principal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  \"sophistication,\" economic security, and psychological security -\\> mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = \"surviving\"\n\n-   Incapacity of mental abstraction and fixed mental context\n\n### **EXTREMISM AS A COMPLEX ALTERNATIVE: A TEST OF HYPOTHESIS**\n\n-   When the Communist Party is small and weak, it tends to uphold non-economic  liberalism/democratic values because of the **presence of intellectual leadership**. \n\n-   When the Communist Party (or Socialist in some cases) is a mass party, it tends to be more  authoritarian (or less committed to democratic values) because it has **stripped its  intellectual leadership**.\n\n-   Underdeveloped countries/economies exacerbate the problems of the lower class and  increase the predisposition to authoritarianism on a like-for-like basis. \n\n-   This argument is evaluated subnationally and supports the urban/rural predisposition to  uphold democratic values and political liberalism.\n\n**HISTORICAL PATTERNS AND DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS**\n\n-   Historically, the left has been responsible for democratization; intellectual leadership still  supports democratic values, but the masses of the lower strata do not understand the  implications of the left beyond economic value to them. \n\n-   Conservatism is vulnerable in democracy for demographic reasons (500). • Neither conservatism nor the authoritarian predisposition of the lower class should be seen  as a threat to democracy. \n\n-   Educational attainment is an essential \"Social Requisites of Democracy\" (Lipset, 1959). \n\n## [Zuckerman, Alan S. 2005. \"Returning to the Social Logic of Political Behavior.\" Ch.1 in Alan S.

Is focuses on how traditional theories from sociology and psychology informed our understanding of political behaviors through interactions with primary groups. However, along the way, the political science discipline that studied behavior began undergoing changes to the way behavioral study was approached - emphasizing, instead, individual level survey research and a reconceptualization of social logic. Fortunately, social logic is back on the mend. \n\n### Research Question/Purpose: \n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to outline the reasons for which those who study political choice and behavior should return to the social logic of the original behavioral revolution in political science. \n\n### Data/Methods: \n\nThere is no data used. Passages, statements, and long quotations stand in for the data. Draws on authors such as Campbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes, Verba Findings: \n\nWe need to return to our roots an incorporate social logic back into behavioral political science \n\nInterpersonal relationships can both prevent **and** facilitate change \n\nMany scholars broke away from social logic, pursuing instead individual level analysis from surveys and redefining social logic to fit their particular needs Newer research is returning to social logic\n\n### Definitions: \n\n**Social Logic of Politics:**\n\na theory of politics that emphasizes the ways in which social factors (social identities, distribution of power across groups, public opinion) influence individual behaviors and how those interact with institutional structures to effect the political process. \n\n### Discussion Questions: \n\nWhat are the consequences of the social logic of politics for our understanding of those communities/persons with intersectional identities? Is this theory anglo centric, or does it retain its superior qualities across groups? \n\nHow might association through primary groups have an impact of institutions? At what point does the saliency of group association diminish? Do our politics/attitudes change drastically with each primary group we grow closer to, or do those groups we first develop our attitudes through matter most? \n\n### Additional Notes: \n\n### Intro: \n\nThe immediate social circumstances of people's lives influence what they believe and do about politics \n\nImmediate social circles are powerful forces in swaying ones political beliefs and actions \n\nGroup relationships are important for fixing and maintaining opinions in relation to large parts of the political system (such as parties) (Key, 1961) \n\n### Sources in Sociology: \n\nparticularly influential were Lazarsfeld, Katz, Berelson, Gaudet, and McPhee Electoral Sociology was where the onset of the behavioral revolution in political science first observed electoral choice \n\nVoting is a reflection of our behavior - of our conversations with other people and the attitudes we shape through those interactions \n\nBy this logic, we vote based on how the relationships we have shape us This is counter to theories of voting as a rational act \n\n### Sources in Social Psychology \n\nparticularly influential were Kurt Lewin and Leon Festinger \n\nhelped explain conformity\n\nsharing an identity (social class, ethnicity, religion, etc.) does NOT define a social group \n\nopinions, preferences, and beliefs are a joint function of how \"real\" the matter is, the views held by the members of a person's groups, and the persons own conceptions joining a group tends to produce changes in opinions and attitudes toward alignment with the group \n\n### The Turn Away from the Social Logic of Politics \n\n#### Started to examine individuals instead of groups \n\nBegan surveying a lot (members of the same social circles shouldn't be surveyed together \\-- its no longer as-if random, and you introduce bias into your survey responses) \n\nTurned social groups into objects of individual identification \n\nElectoral research shifted towards understanding party identification and perceptions of candidates \n\n#### What factors explain this shift away from the social logic? \n\nOne set derives from decision to use national sample surveys as the exclusive source of empirical evidence of behavior \n\nAnother set derives from theory issues \\-- PoliSci insisted that sociologists couldn't explain electoral decisions or outcomes \\-- opted instead for immediate determinants of vote choice: attitudes and calculations \n\nStatistics professors, rearing political sciences, conveyed cherished assumptions of independent sampling \\-- which makes it nearly impossible to capture the psychology of inter-dependance \n\n#### Recognizing that data problems inhibited their ability to follow theoretical preferences \n\nCampbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes altered the definition of the social group and conceptualized it according to a personal perceptions regarding a reference object - taking it far away from its original intent/definition from Lewis Many others would make even larger breaks, such as Key and Downs (immediate circle provides no more than time-saving sources of information to calculating citizens) \n\n### Returning (Again) to the Social Logic of Politics \n\nWe returned! \n\nMichigan survey responses can be used to study the role of immediate social structures on political choice and behavior \n\nTon of other research is starting to do the same thing\n\n# Week 3: Political Beliefs/Political Decision-Making\n\n## [Converse, Philip E. 2006 \\[1964\\]. \"The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics.\" Critical  Review: A Journal of Politics and Society 18(1): 1-74](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16M558a3a-7_AQdWXhfvuM6Swc4BvqhbY/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Normative question: \n\n**Does the citizenry have the \"capacity\" to participate in democracy**? Concern the age-old  question of the demos' potential to access information and process it in a way that would be  individually coherent in election expressions. Converse's (1964) \"The Nature of Belief Systems  in Mass Publics\" marks a turning point since **it can quantitatively/statistically demonstrate**\n\ndemocracy defenders' worst fears: the mass public competence for a normative functioning of  democracy is blight. This question has also been approached with similar results by Lipmann (1922), \"Public Opinion\" and Schumpeter (1950), \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\" (see  also Bennett, 2006, \"Democratic Competence, Before Converse and After\"). \n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nMass Public: Ideologically Innocent  \n\n### DV:\n\nDegree of Belief System Coherence (Individual) (a continuum)\n\n### IV:\n\nLevel of Constrained Idea-Elements (a continuum)\n\n### Data:\n\nConverse stipulates that the degree of coherence of the mass public belief system is contingent on the level of constraints of the idea-elements populating a belief system: the more constrained, the  more coherent. This, in turn, predicts a degree of capacity to participate in democracy according  to one's self-assessed ideological placement. Idea-elements are mainly constrained by the  transmission of information and its digestibility. For this reason, Converse finds that 15% of the  population is deemed ideologue or near-ideologue (possessing a coherent belief system = elite political actors). In contrast, the remaining 85% (the masses) float between having a particular  interest (issue public) or having no idea. **If ideology is not driving most of the public's opinion  incentive, what is?** Converse suggests that \"visible\" social groupings serve as a stable heuristic  informing public opinion: party ID (.70) has more bearing than policies, but policies concerning  visible groups (school desegregation .45) have more bearing than regular policies (government and housing .28). This \"ideology by proxy\" might produce idiosyncratic outcomes as well: the  working man associating with Socialists against the rich but against government reigning of private  enterprise's provision of public goods. \n\n\\\nPICTURE HERE\n\nAcquiring and processing information is contingent on **education**.

The article serves as an overview of the topic. It begins by locating the network research within the rich substantive and theoretical tradition of individually and #group-based studies of #electoral #politics and #public #opinion . It addresses some methodological issues in the study of political information #networks. The article ends with the discussion of theoretical and substantive insights that were generated in several studies, such as the study of communication and persuasion among citizens.\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhat is network analysis? What are the theoretical and substantive insights that we can derive from it, particularly regarding the study of communication and persuasion among citizens? What are some of the methodological issues of network analysis?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nThe author sets out to analyze the contribution of network theories, which have provided us the ability to analyze citizen and democratic politics from across the micro-macro spectrum. Network theories draw on the importance of groups, communities, and political information networks among and between individuals (Downs 1957) while incorporating a conceptual apparatus that extends far past the traditional notions of primary groups, organizations, and societal groups in order to define the relationships that exist among individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Despite its advantages, there are still some methodological issues with network analysis.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\nIt is a literature review so no real data/methods.\n\n### Findings:\n\n#### What is network analysis and how does it fit into the existing literature on the study of individuals and groups?\n\n-   Network studies can be seen as a particular species within a larger genus---as one type of a contextual analysis of politics (Knoke 1990)\n-   networks are formed at the complex intersection between individual preference, individual engagement, and individual location within particular contexts.\n-   Eulau (1986) and Przeworski and Teune (1970) define contextual factors in terms of the aggregation of individual characteristics that affect individuals through processes of social interaction.\n    -   Network Studies diverge from contextual studies in their effort to incorporate a direct mapping for the particular patterns of recurrent interaction among actors.\n-   Individual level and aggregate level analysis both suffer from the same problem: they ignore the implications that arise due to patterns of individual interdependence located in time, place, and setting.\n\n#### What are some of the methodological issues of the study of political information networks?\n\n-   Absent direct measures on patterns of communication, neither the individual measures nor their associated aggregate versions directly address the specifics of communication and persuasion among the individuals who make up the aggregates.\n\n-   Network studies are particularly useful in analyzing well defined populations - such as clergies, political elites, court, and legislatures.\n\n    -   an unfortunate limitation of egocentric networks is the failure to embed dyads within larger networks and in the context of all other dyads in that same network.\n\n    -   However, they aren't straightforward when analyzing large populations - which is the primary object of study for scholars concerned with studies of mass behavior (egocentric network survey questions and snowball surveys can help address this; pg. 5-6)\n\n-   Political communication networks are created at the intersection of individual choice (demand) and environmental supply (which is stochastic).\n\n#### What are the substantive and theoretical insights generated by it?\n\n-   People are more inclined to discuss politics with others who share similar political beliefs\n\n-   Studies ALSO demonstrate that patterns of both agreement and disagreement can be profitably understood within complex processes of communication and persuasion\n\n    -   This means that there is persistent heterogeneity of opinions in less-dense (larger) social networks people aren't as afraid of disagreement as we initially thought\n\n-   Political heterogeneity in the form of cross cutting cleavages can depress political participation BUT increased levels of tolerance (which might be good?)\n\n-   Political communication networks are more important in less developed democracy, where parties are less institutionalize and politics is more volatile\n\n-   Diversity of group discussion decreases the susceptibility of individuals to issue framing by elites\n\n-   Network studies of political communication and persuasion provide a theoretical, analytical response to the human limitations of the citizen in democratic politics.\n\n    -   this is important because it to do with the cognitive limitations of individuals in being self-contained, fully informed, independent maximizers\n\n    -   particularly useful is social capital - which allows people to rely on one another for accurate information\n\n-   political interdependence among citizens helps to explain why public opinion in the aggregate is more sophisticated than the opinions held by the average citizen - its more fully informed\n\n-   solutions to collective action problems can be seen as occurring within networks of relationships among strategic actors who use the information they acquire through repeated interactions to facilitate group efforts\n\n## [Marcus, George, Pavlos Vasilopoulos, and Martial Foucault. 2018. \"Emotional Responses to the Charlie Hebdo Attacks: Addressing the Authoritarianism Puzzle.\" Political Psychology 39(3): 557-575.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n-r7st8o6H0JMLyYxjWaECPMj-PiiCJN/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nThreat + conservative *OR* liberal ideology = increased authoritarian preference\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe literature shows an interaction between threat and public preference for authoritarianism. There are two lines of literature that provide contradictory findings:\n\n-   One argues that threat increases authoritarian preferences among those that are more prone to authoritarianism\n\n-   Another argues that threat is associated with a switch in ideology among those who are normally non-authoritarian Using a two-wave panel study of the French population taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris, the authors find that the two occur simultaneously.\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhat best explains the relationship between individual perceptions of threat and increased preferences for authoritarian policy?\n\nIs the increase in support for authoritarian policies following a terrorist attack the result of:\n\n1.  conservative and authoritarian prone individuals just more strongly manifesting their disposition in response to threat\n\n2.  **OR** increases in ideological \"switching\" to support authoritarian policies in light of threatening events?\n\n### Theory/Argument:\n\nThe authors argue that the endorsement of authoritarian policies can be explained by the theory of affective intelligence. When people experience anxiety due to novel circumstances, such as that induced by terrorist attacks, they will abandon their habitual political attachments and attend to the circumstance in a risk-averse and conservative manner.\n\n-   **H1:** increased anger will enhance decision making based on past dispositional convictions, leading to increased polarization between left and right wing individuals (strengthen authoritarian tendencies for right-wing and weaken those same tendencies for the right)\n\n-   **H2:** increased anxiety will initiate decision-making that is less reliant on extant convictions and hence make those on the left end of the left-right scale more attentive and responsive to calls from the right to adopt authoritarian policies.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n-   Two-wave panel taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris\n\n-   Data retrieved from the CEVIPOF barometer of political confidence\n\n    -   survey was conducted using a representative sample containing 1,524 respondents in two waves\n\n-   Construct two OLS models\n\n    -   one measures attitude change as a function of demographic variables, ideology, as well as anxiety and anger\n\n    -   second model includes two interaction terms that assess fear and anger with the left-right scale respectively with the expectation that the effect of fear and anger on authoritarian policies with be conditional on prior ideological conviction\n\nModel 1:\n\n$$\nAttiude_{t2}=fear_{t2}+anger_{t2}+left/right\\: scale_{t1}+attitude_{t1}+demographics_{t1}\n$$\n\nModel 2:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}Attitude_{t2} &= fear_{t2} + anger_{t2} + left/right\\: scale_{t1} \\\\&+ fear_{t2} * left/right\\: scale_1 + anger_{t2} * left/right\\: scale + attitude_{t1} + demographics_{t1}\\end{align}\n$$\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\n-   support for authoritarian policies\n\n-   a scale consisting of all available items in the study that measure adoption or rejection of authoritarian politic preferences\n\n    -   each item (survey question) was measured using 4-point response option (higher values = support for authoritarian policies)\n\n    -   only one factor possessed an eigenvalue over 1\n\n### Independent Variable:\n\n-   emotional reaction to the terrorist attacks\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Threat increases authoritarian preferences among those who are more prone to authoritarianism AND those with non-authoritarian ideology\n\n-   Overall, people who felt fear following the attack were more likely to have switched their opinion in an authoritarian direction\n\n-   Left-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful after the attack were more likely to change in the direction of endorsing authoritarian policies\n\n-   Right-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful did not experience a change in direction of endorsing authoritarian policies\n\n-   Right-wing citizens who gelt predominantly angry following the attack experienced heightened endorsement of authoritarianism\n\n-   Left-wing citizen on the far-left who felt predominantly angry were the least likely to support authoritarian politics following the attacks (see figure 3) but is not statistically significant\n\n-   **H2** is supported by the first OLS model\n\n-   **H1** is not supported UNTIL the conditional model\n\n### Importance/Contribution:\n\n-   contributes to our understanding of individual level variation in the endorsement of authoritarian policies as well as our understanding of attitudinal polarization (why fear might reduce polarization across a public)\n\n-   important because the psychological mechanisms that account for the public's reaction to terrorist attacks is key to understanding enhanced support for the restriction of civil liberties\n\n-   also advances and systematizes the literature of emotions and politics by assessing the impact of anxiety and anger on the formation of political attitudes\n\n-   takes advantage of REAL threat perceptions, instead of experimentally manipulated ones\n\n-   has external validity (uses a representative sample of the French population)\n\n-   challenges conventional wisdom that emotions are irrational, turbulent states that hinder reasoning - affect activates political reasoning\n\n### Definitions/Concepts:\n\n#### Theories of Affective Intelligence\n\n-   provides a framework for understanding the interplay of fear and anger with ideological convictions\n\n-   with respect to anxiety, the theory holds that when citizens find themselves in novel circumstances, they tend to break from habitual political attachments (ideology/partisanship) and actively try to attend to contemporary circumstances about their environment.\n\n-   with respect to anger, the theory holds that it may trigger authoritarian policy preferences through the activation of habitually learned routines, activating conservative or authoritarian attitudes among individuals who already hold a right-wing disposition.\n\n    -   it is not the potency of threat the increases anger, but rather the degree of normative violation\n\n#### Terror Management Theory (TMT)\n\n-   people feel threatened by their own death and therefore adopt worldviews that allow them to find meaning and worth in their lives.\n\n    -   awareness of ones death can cause anxiety\n\n    -   is used to explain that mortality-related threat reinforces extant political beliefs regardless of whether these are liberal or conservative.\n\n    -

This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being \"motivated- skepticals\" when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e. spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of \"partisan processing\" that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:\n\n**H1:** there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs\n\n**H2:** there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments\n\n**H3:** there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones\n\n**These combined will results in:**\n\n**H4:** attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments\n\n**Which is conditional upon:**\n\n**H5:** the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism\n\n**H6:** and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n-   Two experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control\n\n-   The participants (Ps) were recruited from introductory political science courses at Stony Brook University\n\n-   Study 1: N=126\n\n-   Study 2: N=136\n\n-   **First Part:** Confirmation Bias\n\n-   The participants (Ps) were seated at computers and their political attitudes were assessed through the evaluation of a series of contemporary political issues aimed at activating their priors - this was done through random assignment into either condition 1 or condition 2 (see figure 1)\n\n-   They rated the items on a series of scales to assess attitude strength (0-100) and attitude position (like-dislike; 9 item scale)\n\n-   They then viewed information on an information board, where they could seek out hidden policy arguments by known source alone (see figure 2); the amount of time they spend engaging in each argument was recorded by the software.\n\n-   They viewed eight arguments without a time limit, but could only view each argument ONCE\n\n-   They then completed the same attitude battery from the beginning of the experiment before filing out demographic information and a political knowledge scale ( to assess sophistication)\n\n-   **Second Part:** Disconfirmation Bias\n\n-   administered the battery again, but with the conditions (issues) swapped.\n\n-   then asked to rank the strength of 8 arguments (4 pro and 4 con)\n\n-   then there was a post test battery AGAIN and a recognition memory test\n\n-   they were also asked to list their thoughts regarding two pro and two con arguments they were presented with Arguments were taken from online sources and edited such that they were similar in complexity and length.\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   strong evidence of a prior attitude effect (H1) such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments.\n\n-   Participants counter-argued the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias (H2) - this was supported by the participants spending MORE time on the policy arguments that they disagreed with\n\n-   Also find a confirmation bias (H3)---the seeking out of confirmatory evidence---when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read - this was supported by the participants seeking out information in the matrix that they agreed with\n\n-   Both the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization (H4) ---the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes---especially among those with the strongest priors (H5) and highest levels of political sophistication (H6).\n\n# Week 4: Partisanship/Party Preference\n\n## [Achen, Christopher. 2002. \"Parental Socialization and Rational Party ID.\" Political Behavior 24(2): 151-170.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eDBfh3YzHzQ0ovR5SRV04ve3n0VbGqFr/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Abstract:\n\n### Bumper Sticker\n\n### Model\n\n## [Bankert, Alexa, Leonie Huddy, and Martin Rosema. 2017. \"Measuring Partisanship as a Social Identity in Multi-Party Systems.\" Political Behavior 39(1): 103-132.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KakFRmU4PuCmQS4ckJQ0FFGTKOzxswJe/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\n\"multi-item scales of partisanship can work in and across multi-party systems\"\n\n### Research Question:\n\nHow (if at all) can we create a multi-item scale that measures partisanship across multi-party systems?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nMost national election studies tend to rely on a single measure of partisanship. Such measurements tend to vary in terms of how they are phrased on surveys and also struggle to capture the range of partisan identity, typically at the low and high ends of the spectrum. The authors believe that they can develop a multi-item scale of partisan identity that better predicts political behavior ACROSS various multiparty democracies than the traditional single item scales common on surveys. \n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n#### Partisan Identity Scale\n\nCreates an Eight-Item Scale of Partisanship that is derived from Social Identity Theory Derives three (3) hypothesis to test whether the scale is better than traditional models: **H1**: The Partisan Identity Scale should differentiate equally well among low, middling, and high levels of identity to best uncover the link between identity and political activity across its full range. Expect each scale item to provide more complete information about partisan strength than the traditional single party identification item. \n\nIn terms of the IRT analysis, this means that each item's information function will be more peaked and contain greater information than the standard single measure of partisan strength. In the three European multi-party systems under study, we expect both lower and higher levels of partisan intensity to remain less well detected when measured with the traditional item\n\n**H2:** the partisan identity scale to exhibit all three types of invariance, which means that the fit of the metric invariance model will be no worse than the fit of the configural model, and that the fit of the scalar model will be no worse than that of the metric model. \n\n**H3:** The partisan identity scale should more powerfully predict in-party voting and political engagement than the traditional party identification item. We also expect the partisan identity scale to better predict political behavior than a multi-item indicator of ideological intensity \n\n### Data:\n\nUses Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K. as the three countries with which to derive and apply the scale.\n\n#### Netherlands:\n\n2012 Dutch Parliamentary elections among members of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The LISS contains 5000 households, entailing 8000 individuals Data are drawn from three time points: August 2012 (''Elections 2012''), after the national election in September 2012 (''Dutch Parliamentary Election Study''), and again as part of a module in December 2012/January 2013 (''Politics and Values: Wave 6'').\n\n#### Sweden:\n\nSwedish data were drawn from the Swedish Citizen Panel, a largely opt-in online panel run by the Laboratory of Opinion Research (LORE) at the University of Gothenburg. \n\nUtilize data from Panel 8 (11/14/13--12/18/13) and add-on Panel 8-2 (12/10/13--1/7/14). 16,130 panelists were invited to take the Panel 8 survey and 9279 completed it for a completion rate of 64 %. \n\n2000 panelists were invited to complete Panel 8-2 of which 1496 answered the survey. All panelists in Panel 8.2 and a randomly selected 2000 panelists in Citizen Panel 8 received the identity model. \n\nOur analytic sample is confined to those in Panel 8 and Panel 8-2 who completed the identity items (N = 2464). \n\n#### UK:\n\nData for the U.K were taken from the 2015 British Election Study (BES), an online panel study conducted by YouGov. \n\ndraw on data from pre-election wave 3 of the BES, conducted between September 19, 2014 and October 17, 2014 and pre- election wave 4, conducted in March 2015. \n\nIn total, 27,839 respondents participated in wave 3 and 6141 were randomly assigned and 5954 completed a module that included the partisan identity items. \n\nIn wave 4, 16,629 respondents participated and 3500 of them completed the partisan identity module.\n\n### Measures:\n\nPartisanship Strength by Country vs. Partisan Identity Strength (the 8 Item Scale that is also known as the Partisan Identity Scale) \n\n### Methods:\n\nthe methods are pretty complex, but essentially each hypothesis undergoes a different set of tests/inquiry. \\\n**H1** - figure 1 shows how the 8 item scale that the authors derived is better measure of latent partisan strength than the individual measures in each country. This is also event in the peaks that you can see in each figure. They are more much more sensitive to to the full range of the low- high spectrum. **H2** - invariance is measured using R software to perform multi-group confirmatory analysis (CFA) Configural invariance is a good fit \n\nThe partisan scale has the same metric across countries \n\nIts also scalar across countries \n\n**H3** - analyse the determinants of in-party voting using a logistic regression model \n\nPartisan identity strength has a sizeable influence on in-party voting and its effects exceed that of partisanship strength. \n\nPartisan identity predicted in- party vote and participation while holding partisan strength constant\n\n### Findings:\n\nLevels of partisanship have decreased in Europe in recent decades. \n\nThe eight-item partisan identification scale: \n\n-   provides greater information about partisan intensity than the standard single-item\n\n-   possess the same measurement across all three countries \n\n-   better predicts in-party voting and political participation than ideological intensity measures\n\n## [Campbell, Angus, Philip E.

To the authors, the reason for this has to do with the \"hierarchy of values\". When people have obvious values that rank higher than others (humanitarianism, egalitarianism, equality) AND these #values align with political elites values, then partisan identity remains a steady tool with which to measure the political world against. HOWEVER, for some people, the values rank similarly and therefore cause conflicting #preferences that individuals struggle to resolve. Competing values will produce #volatility in partisan opinions specifically when individuals endorse values that cross the fault lines of partisan dialogue \n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n**Data:** ANES data from 1992, 1994, and 1996\n\n**Model:** Estimates several heteroskedastic regression models as well as ordered probit models The heteroskedastic regression models are used because they expect differences in the response variance of party identification survey items to reflect value-conflict \n\nthis is because citizens with ideologically inconsistent value structures will struggle to identify with one party or another \n\nthere should be unequal variance across observations (which is heteroskedastic) \n\nthis heteroskedasticity is modeled to see if those who experience value conflict reveal less predictable responses to party identification survey items than those who do \n\n### Independent Variable:\n\nValue conflict \n\nis measured using **4 core values** in American Politics: \n\nEgalitarianism, limited government, moral traditionalism, and humanitarianism \n\nThe measures for these values are derived from a set of ANES survey questions on each value\n\n1992 and 1996 are the years they were taken from (1992 is missing humanitarianism)\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\nPartisan Instability \n\nTwo \"manifestations\" \n\n-   predictability of survey response (those experience value conflict should have less predictable responses to partisan questions) to two survey questions: \n\n    -   seven-point party identification scale and ideological self identification scale \n\n-   change in party identification over time (this one is tested using the 1994 and 1996 panel data) \n\n### Findings:\n\n1992 and 1996 elections reveal value-driven volatility in partisan identification \n\n-   Instabilities in political views reflect either: \n\n    -   low information (for some) \n\n    -   trade-offs of the political world that cause conflict of values \n\nValue conflict will disrupt partisan stability when an individuals value organization is non-ideological - i.e. it doesn't quite fit the rhetoric or portrayal by the liberal vs. conservative, left-right spectrum. what makes it non-ideological is that you support values on BOTH sides \n\nThose that have values the match political elites leads to stable partisanship \n\nThose that have internalized value organization that doesn't match elites leads to conflicts of values and partisan volatility. \n\nElites identify and interpret core values to justify their policy positions \n\nValues and ideology are traditionally distinct concepts - but values can be distributed along an ideological spectrum\n\n## [Hatemi, Peter K., et al. 2008. \"Is there a 'Party' in Your Genes?\" Political Research Quarterly 62(3): 584-600.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PxIstrhEiXpHenANgaUkdI35PalEo5Mg/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nGenes don't choose party, but they influence intensity!\n\n### **Independent Variable:**\n\nTwins!

One of those contextual effects is the neighborhood effect, whereby individuals are influenced by the nature of the politically relevant information circulating within their social networks, many of which are spatiallyconstrained to their local area. Although ecological analyses have identified patterns consistent with this hypothesis, there have been virtually no direct investigations of the effect, largely because of the absence of relevant data. Using information from a large, clustered survey of voters at the time of the 1992 general election, this paper uncovers clear evidence of such effects: people are much more likely to change their votes in a particular direction if those with whom they discuss political issues support that direction, especially if they are members of the respondent's family and are the individuals with whom they discuss politics most.\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nWho we talk to is as important as who we are and who we talk to is very much influenced by where we live --- we are what we are, and do what we do, because of where we are, and have been **OR** those who talk together tend to vote together.\n\n### Research Question:\n\nDoes the neighborhood effect have an impact on voter decisions?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nMost researchers have accepted that voters are influence by their immediate social and geographical environments as well as their own individual circumstances. However, the way in which such contextual factors operate is contested. Most explanations point to spatial variation in economic and political contexts and the driving force behind voter's decisions. That is, \"nonsocial\" context on economic and political conditions at the local and national level compose the voting repertoire with which individuals draw on at the polls.\n\nHowever, the authors speculate that the influence of immediate social networks (family, friends, colleagues) on individual opinions informs their voting behavior. Early research explored such possibilities, but scarcity of data left this \"neighborhood effect\" to be abandoned if favor of explanations that could be explored.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nMain hypothesis: Each group would be influenced by the dominant nature of electorally relevant information in their social networks---those who changed the party that they supported should be in networks where support for their new party is strong, whereas those who remained loyal to a party should be in networks that give it strong support.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n-   Explores contextual effects on voting behavior in Great Britain\n\n-   Uses data collected in the British Election Study (BES) from the 1992 British General Election, which lends itself to the data requirement of networks of people living in the same locality.\n\n    -   The data uses a cluster rather than a random sample: 210 \"points\" (which are polling districts made up of 1,000-2,000 voters).\n\n    -   Used a stratified random design with a random sample of respondents selected from the electoral roll for the district\n\n    -   Produces 2,526 individuals with an average sample size of around 16 per cluster, with a peaked distribution between 16 and 19\n\n-   Authors chose to focus on why some respondents, from their own recollection, changed their vote between 1987 and 1992 while others did not\n\n-   By aggregating the reported 1987 votes of each BES respondent by polling district, the authors were able to estimate the vote share there for each of the three main political parties that fought in all British constituencies in both 1987 and 1992: Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat (Alliance in 1987).\n\n-   **First analysis:**\n\n    -   Contrasts those who switched their vote to a particular party in 1992 (coded 1) against those who didn't (coded 0)\n\n    -   Gives 3 dependent variables:\n\n        -   1\\. switch to conservative 2) switch to labor 3) switch to Liberal\n\n    -   Employs a Logistic Regression (because the DVs are binary)\n\n    -   Then does the same thing but looks at those who defected (voted for each party in 1987) So those who voted for a particular party in 1987 and again in 1992 (the loyalists) against those that voted for another party/ didn't vote at all in 1992 (the defectors)\n\n-   **Second analysis:**\n\n    -   looks at the impact of conversations with the individuals respondents named as the first (primary) discussant of politics and analyzing how that affected transitions to each party\n\n    -   Measures those who who didn't vote for the same party in 1992 as they did in 1987 against those who did\n\n    -   Also looks at those who defected versus those who didn't\n\n-   **Third analysis:**\n\n    -   Assesses the degree to which cross cutting relationships impact vote choice by bringing in two additional discussants that the respondents listed\n\n    -   The more discussants who support a particular party, the greater the expected probability that an individual will switch to that party, and the less the probability that he or she will defect from it.\n\n-   **Fourth analysis:**\n\n    -   It's possible that discussants don't live in the same neighborhood (i.e. context) as the respondent. Therefore, there a chance that political context and conversations on voting linked, or could they be separate?\n\n    -   hypothesize that the more support a party has in a locality (the independent variables employed in the regressions reported in Tables 3 and 4), the greater the probability that individuals there will encounter, talk to, and be converted by that party's partisans\n\n    -   tested by dividing the respondents according to how many discussants they report having a particular partisanship, which can vary from 0 to 3.\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Social networks are indeed important influences on voting decisions\n\n    -   Families who talk together, vote together! (kinda) - voters were more likely to vote/not vote for a party based on conversations they had with their families\n\n    -   More accurately: those who talked together tended to vote together.\n\n    -   Conversations with friends are also important\n\n-   **First analysis:**\n\n    -   the more their local area was dominated by supporters of a particular party, the greater the probability that individuals switched their support to that party between 1987 and 1992---if they had not voted for it at the first of those two election\n\n    -   local context did not influence voters' decisions to abandon a party they have previously supported, but that the choice of which party to switch their support to was influenced by local conditions---which is the hypothesized mechanism that underlies the neighborhood effect.\n\n-   **Second analysis:**\n\n    -   Those who did not voter conservative in 1987 were more likely to vote conservative in 1992 if their primary discussant was conservative\n\n        -   talking to Labour or Liberal party discussants made not conservative voters less likely to vote conservative (duh)\n\n    -   Same results hold for other parties - voters were more likely to vote for a particular party if the primary discussant was a member of that party\n\n    -   Frequency of conversation about politics appeared to have no influence\n\n    -   those people who voted for a party in 1987 were less likely to vote for another party in 1992 if their primary discussant had been a supporter of the same parter when compared to their discussant being from another party or having no discussant at all\n\n-   **Third analysis:**\n\n    -   More likely to support and less likely to defect if the discussants were from the same party\n\n-   **Fourth Analysis:**\n\n    -   If a respondent had more discussants from a particular party, then there was also an associated increase in the number of votes for that party in the respondents district\n\n    -   This shows that there is a link between spatial and communicative contexts, supporting the neighboring effects.\n\n-   It is not logical to ignore social networks, and conversations within them, as a possible influence on the voting decision of individuals\n\n### Non-Findings:\n\n-   Can't distinguish if the influential conversations are locally based\n\n-   They know that the conversations matter, but they have no information on the relative locations of the individuals involved in those conversations (how immediate are they?).\n\n-   Also don't know what the content of the conversations were\n\n## [NEED TO ADD WESTHOLM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5n2GZVIRKNrlYdQorMoC6b32G9O5rRw/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# Week 6: Vote Choice - Economic Motivations\n\n## [Bratten, Michael, and Robert Mattes. 2001. \"Support for Democracy in Africa: Intrinsic or Instrumental?\" British Journal of Political Science 31(3): 447-474.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B1mhlUPwh5ERbY-Ql4b2MICIKMQBeIl1/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nAfrican democracy persists b/c of economic AND political change.\n\n### Independent Variable:\n\neconomic, political, and general performance factors on democratic regime\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\nattitudes about democracy\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhy do Africans support democracy?\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n-   Explanatory factors: why variation in support for/satisfaction with democracy?\n\n    -   Social characteristics of population such as literacy, income and gender\n\n    -   Economic goods: popular perceptions of national economic conditions, personal quality of life, and access to materials and services shape feelings about democracy\n\n    -   Political goods: Is the delivery of civil rights and political equality enough?\n\n    -   General performance factors: citizens' overall assessment of governmental performance for 3 reasons:\n\n### Data:\n\n-   3 separate surveys on political attitudes in Ghana, Zambia, and South Africa\n\n    -   Zambia: 1,182 respondents following \"dubious\" 1996 election\n\n    -   South Africa: 3,500 stratified by race, province, community size in 1997 following free & fair elections\n\n    -   Ghana: 2,005 respondents in 1999 following free & fair 1996 elections\n\n        -   All 3 surveys included questions on citizen understanding of the meaning of democracy, support for, and satisfaction with democracy in theory and n practice\n\n### Methods:\n\nMultiple regression in OLS\n\n### Findings:\n\nPopular support for democracy in African countries similar to other Third Wave countries\n\n-   Lower levels of mass satisfaction w/regime performance in African countries\n\n-   General public in African countries thinks instrumentally: support for democracy hinges critically upon popular approval of government achievements\n\n-   Outside of South Africa, many Africans value political goods\n\n**Additional findings:**\n\n1.

It argues that thanks to years of economic adversity, Latin Americans have developed long, sophisticated #economic-memories . Although this has resulted in rising frustration with democratic government, according to recent opinion polls, it has not always led voters to #punish all parties responsible for hardship at election time. A panel study of the region's presidential systems demonstrates that citizens punish incumbents by voting for established #nonincumbents when electoral laws reduce opportunities available to small parties in the systems, even if #nonincumbents have also been blamed for hard economic times. More #permissive-electoral-systems , in contrast, encourage citizens to reject all parties responsible for economic decline. The analysis demonstrates how economic and electoral concerns interact to affect voting behavior, #political-accountability , and #public-opinion in Latin America.\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nEconomic Evaluations Voter Laws Voter Behavior\n\n### Research Question:\n\nIf most Latin Americans have faced economic hardship during successive governments, why do they reject both the incumbent and non-incumbent parties in some systems and only the incumbent party in others?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nMany Latin American economies have experienced some form poor performance that has resulted in different forms of electoral punishment. Barton, drawing on previous literature regarding economic theories of voter behavior, devises a theory that enables her to assess the institutional features that interact with economic performance to determine who voters choose to punish in subsequent elections. In highly permissible systems, where there are more parties to choose from, voters memories of economic performance can interact with electoral strategies to allow the punishment of multiple parties (as has been the case in multiple countries). However, more restrictive systems, which limit the number of viable parties, forces voters to focus their punishing efforts on the incumbent alone, as they require an alternative option of some form and therefore increases support for the form incumbent.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n-   panel data from 13 Latin American Countries\n\n    -   required (a) to be a presidential system and have had (b) more than one party win the presidency, so that current and former incumbents compete; (c) to have elections deemed free of fraud by international observers, so that their results reflect voters' reactions to party performance; and (d) to have an economic crisis and/or economic reform during democratic rule.\n\n    -   in these countries, 64 elections were held, with 39 instances in which current and former incumbents competed for power\n\n### Independent Variable:\n\neconomic performance as measured by the percentage change in GDP per capita during each parties last 2 years in office.\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\n-   Change in support for incumbents - measured as the difference between votes received by an incumbent party in presidential elections while in office and votes received in the previous election when the party won.\n\n-   Change in support for non-incumbents out of power - measured as change in support received in elections after leaving office and support when the party originally came into power.\n\n### Model:\n\n-   Uses OLS with #panel-corrected standard errors #PCSEs , which were selected because of the limited number of countries and small (often unbalanced) number of observations in each panel.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n-   **H1:** When incumbent parties are blamed for poor economic performance, they will lose support, regardless of the electoral system used to elect them.\n\n-   **H2:** Nonincumbent parties previously in power will derive greater electoral benefits in restrictive, compared with permissive, electoral contexts when incumbent parties are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.\n\n-   **H3:** Former incumbents blamed for economic decline will continue to receive lower levels of support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts, all else being equal.\n\n-   **H4:** Current incumbents will gain support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts when former incumbents are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.\n\n### Findings:\n\n| Hypothesis | Support | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| H1         | Yes     | incumbent parties' support decreases with economic downturns, without regard to institutional change (p.430)                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| H2         | Yes     | when electoral laws construct institutional barriers to small parties (restrictive), groups once holding the presidency will suffer losses in support when incumbents manage economic growth; as GDP declines, parties previously in power begin to experience a surge of supprot (p.431)   |\n| H3         | Yes     | accounting for the presence of Honduras, there was no relationship between poor economic performance and punishment of former incumbents in restrictive systems; there was a relationship between poor economic performance and the punishment of incumbents in permissive systems (pg.436) |\n| H4         | Yes     | nonincumbents' performance has implications for incumbents' support. As predicted, incumbents gain about 10% of the national votes when nonincumbents are responsible for neoliberal economic reform in all electoral settings                                                              |\n\n### Other Findings:\n\n-   Restrictive institutions reduce the incentive for voters to waste support on parties unlikely to win.\n\n-   Rather than helping nonincumbents weather the electoral effect of incumbents' economic growth, runoffs cause nonincumbents to suffer additional electoral losses.\n\n## Lewis-Beck, Michael S., and Mary Stegmaier. 2009. \"Economic Models of Voting.\" OHPB. Ch. 27: 518-537.\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nThe state of the economy can help predict voter decisions.\n\n### Purpose:\n\nThis is a literature review on micro-level, survey research studies of economic voting in the U.S., Britain, France, and Globally.\n\n### Overview:\n\nQuestions regarding the precise nature of economic voting led to four general \"types\".\n\n1.  Retrospective Voting\n    1.  Originating with V.O. Key (1966), this type of voting occurs when voters review the performance of the incumbent government.\n2.  Prospective Voting\n    1.  Originating with Downs (1957), this type of voting occurs when voters look to the future and vote according to the governments potential economic performance.\n3.  Pocketbook Voting (personal finances)\n    1.  This theory of voting suggests that when personal or household financial conditions have deteriorated, voters will punish the incumbent.\n4.  Sociotropic Voting (national economy rather than personal finances).\n    1.  This theory of voting suggests that voters are more likely to be considering the national economic situation when casting their vote.\n\nOf these types, the retrospective sociotropic and prospective sociotropic appear to be the most relevant across empirical evaluations. That is, people tend to vote based of their perceptions of national economic performance, both in the past (retrospective sociotropic) and the future (prospective sociotropic). The type of voting that is cued depends on whether or not an incumbent is running, and therefore a reliable place to point blame. Essentially, the reward-punishment hypothesis holds up across settings, with slight variation according to group membership (party id, gender, etc.), institutional context (voting system, prime-minister v. president, number of parties) and economic context (personal, neighborhood, national).\n\n### Findings:\n\n#### United States:\n\n-   ANES is good source for election studies\n-   Most theories of economic voting focus on the U.S.\n-   Pocketbook voting is weak in presidential elections \\-- sociotropic is strong\n-   Strength of economic voting can cary based on context \\-- such is the case when considering the attribution of responsibility (e.g. the attribution of blame to particular party/candidate/branch of government)\n    -   in the U.S. the presidency is an important institutional context for which to blame punish electorally\n-   While other types of factors matter and interact them, sociotropic economic effects (both retrospective and prospective) themselves cannot be understated when assessing the general behavior of the voter population.\n\n#### Britain:\n\n-   BES is a good source for election studies\n-   British voters show the same trends of reward and punishment regarding economic voting\n-   There may be important regional contexts\n    -   Johnston 1997 finds that when voter's perceptions of their neighborhoods are that they are worse off, they will punish the incumbent\n-   Retrospective and Prospective are both important\n-   Perceptual shifts in economic conditions are almost as great as realigning with a different party (Clarke et al. 2004)\n\n#### France:\n\n-   Eurobarometer and FNES are good sources for election studies\n-   A general finding---significant retrospective sociotropic effects, but no retrospective pocketbook effects\n-   It is largely sociotropic and more or less equally retrospective or prospective, depending in part on the institutional context.\n-   The French voter is sophisticated, knowing whom and how much to blame.\n    -   When government is unified, the president is the lightning rod for economic discontent. However, under cohabitation, the burden shifts to the prime minister.\n-   Smaller parties are blamed less than large parties, legislative candidates are blamed less than presidential candidates, and presidential candidates who are prime minister are blamed more than presidential candidates who are not prime minister.\n\n#### Cross-National Studies:\n\n-   Similar trends have been found in cross-national studies\n    -   Lewis‐Beck and Mitchell (1990), on the five major western European countries; Chappell and Veiga (2000), on thirteen western European nations; Pacek (1994) and Tucker (2001) on central European samples; Remmer (1991) on twelve Latin American countries; Pacek and Radcli (1995) on eight low‐income nations; Wilkin, Haller, and Norporth (1997) on a worldwide sample of countries.\n-   Important Takeaways:\n    -   Responsibility Hypothesis seems to hold - that when responsibility is hard to pin down, voters are less likely to punish incumbents - this is an important contextual factors\n\n        -   Such is the case in more countries with more \"coalitional complexity\" \\-- when more parties make up the incumbent government, is it difficult to assign blame\n\n        -   Presidential Systems and systems with more restrictive electoral laws tend to strengthen the economic vote\n\n        -   In the context of globalization, there is a significant decrease in economic voting in the face of open trade, as electorates can't assign blame to the government alone\n\n# Week 7: Societal Cleavages\n\n## [Inglehart, Ronald, and Pippa Norris. 2003.

How much does culture matter for gender equality compared to levels of societal development and legal-institutional structures?\n\n### **Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  Societal modernization brings changed cultural attitudes toward gender equality through:\n\n    1.  a transition from traditional to secular-rational values, and\n\n    2.  a transition from survival to self-expression values.\n\n2.  These shifts are coherent and predictable, and can be shown through:\n\n    1.  Cross-national comparisons\n\n    2.  Sectoral comparisons (most secure vs. less secure sectors of the public)\n\n    3.  Gender comparisons\n\n    4.  Generational comparisons\n\n    5.  Religious legacies -- controlling for society's level of GNP per capita & workforce structure, Islamic societies will be less supportive of gender equality (19)\n\n### **Data:**\n\n-   Evidence of changing attitudes towards gender equality in over 70 countries using the World Values and European Values surveys from 1981-2001\n\n-   Types of societies:\n\n    -   Human Development Index 100-point scale of societal modernization using adult literacy and education, life expectancy, and real per capita GDP\n\n        -   Postindustrial societies = 28 states w/HDI over .9 and mean per capita GDP of \\$29,585\n\n        -   Industrial societies = 58 states w/HDI .74-.899 and GDP of at least \\$6,314\n\n        -   Agrarian societies = 97 states w/HDI \\<.739 and GDP of \\$1,098\n\n-   Types of states:\n\n    -   Gastil index, 7-point scale used by Freedom House, as a standard measure of political rights and civil liberties (higher score = higher levels of democracy)\n\n    -   Length of democratic stability from Freedom House ratings, 1972-2000\n\n        -   Older democracies = 39 states w/\\> 20 yrs as dem & 5.5-7.0 FH rating\n\n        -   Newer democracies = 43 states w/\\< 20 yrs as a dem & 5.5-7.0 FH rating\n\n        -   Semi-democracies = 47 states w/\\< 20 yrs as a dem & 3.5-5.5 FH rating\n\n        -   Non-democracies = 62 states w/FH rating of 1.0-3.0\n\n-   Analysis of cultural attitudes using World Values Survey (WVS) pooled survey with all waves; combined with Eurobarometer Survey and Political Action Study to fill in gaps\n\n### **Methods:**\n\n-   \"Convergence model\" using Przeworski & Teune's \"most different system\" design\n\n    -   Seeks to maximize contrasts among societies to distinguish systematic clusters of characteristics associated with different dimensions of gender equality\n\n### **Findings:**\n\n-   Cultural traditions are enduring in shaping men's and women's worldviews (but not enough on their own)\n\n-   Slow shifts are taking place to move from traditional towards more egalitarian sex roles\n\n-   Where there are more egalitarian attitudes, these are systematically related to the actual conditions of women's and men's lives\n\n### **Questions:**\n\n1.  Inglehart & Norris describe social modernization and the gender equality attitudes that accompany it as \"probabilistic, not deterministic\" (11). But if these slow attitudinal changes are happening across the majority of the population, how do we account for democratic backsliding and the rise of violence against minorities in postindustrial countries following exogenous shocks/social strains? (think terrorist attacks, economic shocks like the 2008 recession, mass migration/immigration from Syria, etc.). Do we think that these represent latent variables that were always present? Are they blips along a long-term progressive path?

When such is the case, both men and women have an incentive to cultivate their outside options by entering into paid work, and the distribution of unpaid work is determined by bargaining powers dependent upon the political-economic factors outside the family.\n\nWhat is important is that divorce is an option that varies across contexts. In places where divorce is a more viable, then outside options become important for long-term welfare. Meaning that both sexes will prefer social and economic policies that maximize these options, even if it reduces household income or other measures of aggregate welfare.\n\nMen are disincentivized to support their wives working because 1.) it increases her agency/options to exit the marriage and 2.) increases the amount of work he has to do in the home. Additionally, women in specific skills economies typically bear a bigger penalty for career interruptions such as for child rearing, they face more limited work opportunities and may invest less in their market-relevant education as a result. This, in turn, weakens their bargaining power at home, and they get stuck sweeping floors more of the time than their counterparts in economies that specialize in general skills. This occurs unless the government steps in and adopts policies to counter the disadvantages of women in specific skills countries. This is where the gender gap in preferences enters the story.\n\n## [Lijphart, Arend. 1979. \"Religious vs. Linguistic vs. Class Voting: The 'Crucial Experiment' of Comparing Belgium, Canada, South Africa and Switzerland.\" American Political Science Review 73(2): 442-458.](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:ec792f1c-b59a-4284-986e-ba6e93f80638)\n\n### **Bumper Sticker:**\n\nReligion and Language Highly Influence Voting Preferences!\n\n### **IV:**\n\nReligiosity, class, and language\n\n### **DV:**\n\nParty choice/voting behavior\n\n### **Research question:**\n\nHow do language and religion influence voter preferences?\n\n### **Data:**\n\n-   Survey data from 4 separate countries around roughly similar time periods\n\n### **Methods:**\n\n-   Multivariate analysis comparing 4 countries\n\n    -   AID technique -- automatic interaction detector (tree analysis)\n\n### **Findings:**\n\n-   In \"decisive trial of strength,\" religion is the most influential factor, followed closely by language, with class a distant third.\n\n### **Questions:**\n\n1.

To what extent do urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race?\n\n2.  Are these identities consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world?\n\n### Abstract:\n\nAs the American political landscape becomes increasingly divided along urban--rural lines, it raises the prospect of deepening social identities that are tied to one's community-type. As community-type becomes an important social identity, it can lead to favoritism of one's community in-group, or denigration of one's community out-group. We explore the extent to which urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race, and whether they are consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world. Using national survey data, we demonstrate that people in both urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors which are correlated with the urban--rural divide. We use two different experiments to assess the consequences of this identity, finding that there are distinct effects in the political arena when allocating government resources, and in the non-political world when judging hypothetical job applications. These effects are generally smaller in magnitude than other factors, such as partisanship, but suggest that community-type identities are important in politics.\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nLyons and Utych set out to assess what appears to be a growing divide between rural and urban party affiliation and voting patterns.They explore the extent to which people use information about rural and urban community types to form impressions about American politics, as well as how people use this information to make decisions about political and non-political matters. If people are using urban and rural identities in similar ways to partisanship, and partisanship uses group identity as a way of perceiving the world, then there is a chance that people may be using geographic information such as urban and rural community type to evaluate the political and interpersonal landscape around them.\n\nThey focus on discriminatory behaviors. If urban and rural community types are taking on the qualities of social identities, then the in-group and out-group processing of information along lines of community type should be salient. That is, those from urban (rural) locations should confer a preference to urban (rural) locations/people, and a penalty to rural (urban) locations/people when making decisions that allocate resources, benefits, or opportunities.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\nUses three different studies\n\n### First Study:\n\n1.  First, uses National Survey Data to show that people perceive values differences between people who live in rural and urban places \\-- appear to be driven by more than just party or race\n\n    1.  do people who live in rural (urban) areas think that people who live in urban (rural) places are different than them, and do they think that they are getting an unfair shake from government relative to those who live in other community types?\n\n    2.  Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 32)\n\n    3.  Ordered logit\n\n#### IV:\n\nwhether the respondents live in urban or rural setting\n\n#### DV:\n\n1.  perceptions of others values\n\n    1.  used by creating a dichotomous variable from three survey questions (p.80)\n\n2.  perceptions of government distribution of resources across community types\n\n    1.  also created a dichotomous variable from survey questions (p.84-85)\n\n### Second Study:\n\n1.  Second, uses a conjoint experiment to explore where urban or rural identities are consequential for how people distribute resources in a hypothetical political scenario\n\n    1.  conducted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in July 2019.7 We recruited 572 respondents to participate in the study, who were paid \\$1.25 to participate in a study that took less than 10 min, on average.\n\n        1.  over representative of young, liberal, white, educated, male\n\n        2.  First, participants were provided a sample pairing of two cities, to familiarize themselves with the task. Participants were told they were in charge of allocating \\$50,000 in highway funding between two cities. These cities were randomly assigned to vary on three dimensions---location (urban, suburban, or rural), mayor partisanship (Republican, Democrat, or non-partisan), year of last investment (2006, 2012, or 2018), percentage African-American (5%, 20%, or 65%) and average household income (\\$30,000, \\$60,000, or \\$90,000). Each individual completed the practice trial, and then 15 test trials.\n\n        3.  key variation is based on the \"location\" variation, allowing us to compare how individuals allocate funding between urban, suburban, and rural areas.\n\n        4.  One observation for each trial includes city characteristics for City A, while the second observation includes city characteristics for City B.\n\n#### D.V.\n\n1.  the allocation decision between City A or City B, which takes a value of 1 if the respondent allocates funding to that city, and 0 if they allocate funding for the other city.\n\n#### Findings:\n\n1.  Find that rural identities influence opinions and that partisans react to urban and rural information in expected ways\n\n2.  Find that Democrats are more likely prefer urban areas to suburban areas, but not difference in the allocation of resources between Urban and Rural Republicans, however, are more likely to allocate to rural areas\n\n3.  No location based preferences for rural respondents\n\n### Third Study:\n\n1.  Third, uses a resume experience to test discrimination in a non-political setting, finding that people evaluate hypothetical job applicants more favorably when they are from the same community types\n\n    1.  recruited 1467 respondents via MTurk who live in urban or rural areas13 to participate in the study, who were paid \\$0.50 to participate in a study that took roughly 2.5 min to complete, on average.\n\n    2.  Participants shown a hypothetical resume and then asked to rate the applicant on a series of evaluative criteria/ traits\n\n    3.  participants had preference for co-location\n\n#### Expectations:\n\n-   urban and rural identities are formative for the way in which people view themselves and others, and it is in ways that go above and beyond race, partisanship, and other demographic or socioeconomic factors\n\n-   Democrats should discriminate in a fashion that confers favor to urban locations or people, while Republicans should show a preference for rural locations or people.\n\n### Findings:\n\n1.  Both urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors\n\n2.  Each identity has a distinct impact on the political arenas when is comes to allocating government resources\n\n3.  Also has an impact in the non-political world when judging job applications\n\n4.  Effects are smaller than other factors, such as partisanship\n\n5.  Less educated community residents are more likely to perceive values difference\n\n    1.  In rural places, so are younger people, males, whites, liberals, and non-religious service attenders\n\n    2.  results are particularly related to rural areas\n\n6.  For government resources\n\n    1.  People who are older, more educated, Republicans and very conservative are the most likely to believe that urban area get more than their fair share of resources. By far the largest effect is from ideology (0.57 change in predicted probability across the full range), with partisanship (0.47 change in predicted probability) and age (0.22 change in predicted probability) also resulting in meaningful changes in predicted probabilities.\n\n7.  urban residents appear to have a well-defined out group, but it isn't rural areas, it is the suburbs\n\n## Posner, Daniel N. 2004. \"The Political Salience of Cultural Difference: Why Chewas and Tumbukas Are Allies in Zambia and Adversaries in Malawi.\" American Political Science Review 98(4): 529-545.\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nWhen it comes to groups, relative size matters\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhy do some cultural differences matter for politics and others not?\n\n### IV:\n\nPolitical salience of cultural difference\n\n### DV:\n\nRelative group size for coalition-building= cultural demography theory\n\n### Unit of Analysis:\n\ncultural dyad= relationship between the two groups on either side of the border, not the individual ethnic group\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\nCollect data on the border in July and August 2001: questionnaire in 4 villages/each pair facing each other across the border.\n\n• Homogeneity of populations (equidistant from Ngoni population that could have \"contaminated\" the sample villages)\n\n• Similarity, control naturally for geo and eco factors by choosing pairs in the same vicinitude\n\n• Exposed to similar national political affairs and markets (proxied by paved routes)\n\n• 42 interviews in each Zambia villages/48 in each Malawi villages= 180 total obs.\n\n• Focus groups as supplement\n\n### Findings:\n\n• Each group understand objective differences (Malawians more negative about the other)\n\n• Difference in how they would allow the other group to integrate their lives politically or in the family sphere= Malawi side prefers separation at more than 50% on average where it is 20% on the other side (series of categorical mean tested differences)\n\n• Biggest predictor is the physical location of the village NOT objective cultural difference.\n\n• The physical location makes a political salience of intergroup difference=how much they attach meaning to their differences (537)= Meaning-making (Wedeen)\n\n# Week 8: Protests/Social Movements/Violence\n\n## [Dalton, Russell, Alix Van Sickle and Steven Weldon. 2009. \"The Individual-Institutional Nexus of Protest Behavior.\" British Journal of Political Science 40(1): 51-73.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kq4S_aM2ddveYWCsxkZb4ejNH4MVVIxc/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nmicro-macro multilevel analysis matters in political action behavior\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhat kind of individual/contextual interplay favors a behavior inclined to political action such as protests?\n\n### IV:\n\nprotest behavior\n\n### DV:\n\nmicro-macro nexus\n\n### Findings:\n\nThe cultural modernization theory of protest: economic and political development favors protests helping resources such as education and membership to organization (akin to Klandermans) to flourish fostering mobilization =/ grievance is a predictor in developing countries.\n\n## [Klandermans, Bert. 2002. \"How Group Identification Helps to Overcome the Dilemma of Collective Action.\" American Behavioral Scientist 45(5): 887-900.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S4TwUxNJnRC-Cq1HTvDxr8g_3Ht5ZzLU/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nvoluntary membership to ID group matters for political action such as protests\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhich type of group identification will spur political action?\n\n### IV:\n\nprotest\n\n### DV:\n\ntype of group id (cognitive, evaluative, affective)\n\n### Mechanism:\n\ndepersonalization and politicization\n\n### Findings:\n\nAffective and behavioral ID predisposes political action such as protest and protest participation solidifies behavioral ID.\n\n### Depersonalization:\n\n-   individual become the member of a group\n\n-   which group will the individual adhere to?

(the scholars didn't like the social movements so that is why their theories are rather dismissive of the people that make them up.)**\n\n1.  **Pre 1960 Perspective -** In social movements, people lose their individuality and become susceptible to irrational behavior, which may include great bravery and sacrifice for the group, but also uncontrolled violence towards outsiders. Mostly negative view of social movements. \n\n    1.  \"Crowd-psychological ideas\" - Max Weber (charismatic leadership), Emile Durkheim (collective conscience), Gustave Le Bon. \n\n2.  **Adorno perspective -** \"In search for new social anchors, the uprooted and isolated individuals of mass society were seen as easy targets for totalitarian mass movements of the left and right. Such movements were moreover seens as attracting particular types of 'authoritarian' personalities.\"\n\n    1.  Motivated by theories of \"mass society\"\n\n    2.  Rapid social change was seen as breaking down traditional social ties and norms.\n\n3.  **Theories of Relative Deprivation -** gap between what people get and what they expect and aspire to get on the basis of past trends and comparisons with other groups.\n\n    1.  Deprivation leads to frustration and striking out at perceived sources of anger.\n\n### Resource Mobilization Perspective:\n\n**1960s radical movements changed everything. Mancur Olson's economic theory of collective action changes everything.**\n\n1.  **Mancur Olson perspective** - social movements were interpreted as rational, utility maximizing actors, and new vocabulary. \n\n    1.  Basically rat choice.\n\n    2.  Emphasized group solidarity and the integration of individuals into social networks rather than breakdown of social norms and social uprootedness. Not just a bunch of isolated weirdos. - **KEY DIFFERENCE FROM CLASSICAL PERSPECTIVE.**\n\n    3.  Problems with it: downplays context and just typical issues with rat choice.\n\n### Political Opportunity Structure Perspective:\n\n**Want more focus on external factors in shaping social movements. Mobilization + classical theories focused on internal factors.**\n\n1.  **Political opportunity structures** - argue that variations in the amount and types of social movement activity can be explained by variations in the political context that they confront. \n\n    1.  Social movement structure/existence is related to factors such as electoral volatility, composition of party system, inst. Centralization, separation of powers, political elites.\n\n    2.  Contrast French protests to Swiss protests. French are bigger because of more centralization.\n\n    3.  Still problematic - diminishes the conception of agency. Opportunities are not decided by external factors but creative individuals that set the plan/agenda. \n\n### Evolutionary Model Perspective:\n\n**Focus on interplay of movement-external (environmental selection) and internal (variation/innovation and retention/diffusion) elements.**\n\n-   New model.\n\n-   Does not require strong assumptions about cognitive or psychological mechanisms that generate strategic decisions of movement activists and their opponents.\n\n-   Bridge between agency-orientated and structural perspective within social movement research.\n\n## [Thomas, Jakana L., and Kanisha D.

As a VPO grows larger, it is more likely to include women participants.\n\n2.  VPOs that rely on terrorist tactics are more likely to involve women than organizations that do not use terrorism.\n\n3.  VPOs with agendas that support gender equality are more likely to include women than organizations with gender-neutral agendas.\n\n4.  The likelihood of women's participation in a given VPO is related to the number of other violent organizations operating in its politically-relevant environment.\n\n### Data:\n\n-   Mix of qual/quant; original cross-sectional dataset on presence of women, women's roles and key organizational-level characteristics of 166 violent political orgs across 19 African countries 1950-2011\n\n### Methods:\n\n-   Purposive stratified sampling to select 19 countries\n\n-   logistic regression models in multivariate setting; 4 sets of results each (see Tables 3 & 4)\n\n    -   Base model in column 1\n\n    -   Full set of explanatory variables column 2\n\n    -   Controls in supply-related characteristics column 3\n\n    -   Controls for any additional group-level covariate column 4\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Organization-based opportunities for women's participation explain female membership in violent political organizations.\n\n### Questions:\n\n1.  Is this generalizable (lol)?\n\n2.  I get the impression that the leadership of VPOs is/assumed to be men. Is this the case? Are there examples of VPOs led by women?\n\n3.  There also appears to be an assumption that women participate in VPOs for rational reasons such as being victimized, fighting for increased political rights, etc. Outside of Islamic fundamentalism, are there other ways in which women can be radicalized to participate in violence that the study fails to control for?\n\n### General Notes:\n\n-   Most studies ignore women's participation in VPOs\n\n-   If they do examine this phenomenon, it's through case studies or small-N studies, and focused on \"supply-side\" dynamics (what characteristics condition women towards violence) rather then \"demand-side\" dynamics (ways in which different organizational preferences & behaviors work to facilitate or impede women's presence in VPOs)\n\n    -   \"Women's voluntary participation in violent politics is tied invariably to the availability of opportunities\" (489)\n\n-   3 assumptions:\n\n1.  Recruiter and female participants choose purposefully among action alternatives to maximize benefits and minimize costs (everyone thinks like an economist)\n\n2.

Instead, the authors explore the content of these events. The goal of the paper is to check the plausibility of tentative thesis - that mass violence can be perceived through a rationalist framework\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nTraditional explanations for why insurgent groups choose to engage is mass violence have focused primarily on ideology as the main explanatory factor. The authors argue that, counter to traditional accounts, mass violence against civilians is strategic with aims of maximizing civilian support. They sketch a theoretical framework for the analysis of civil wars to see how it fares in one particular case: insurgent violence in Algeria. \n\n### Method/Finding:\n\n-   Focus on insurgent violence in Algeria in 1996 during the civil war, which started in 1992 after the Algerian Military (Incumbents) \"aborted\" the parliamentary election and terminated democracy \n\n    -   This deprived the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of a sweeping victory and they eventually become outlawed insurgents that formed into two groups - the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) and the GIA (which is believed to have contributed to most of the Massacres. \n\n-   Generalized out to other countries at the end of the paper. \n\n-   They find that Massacres tend to happen under conditions of fragmented rule, support for the incumbent state, and escalating violence.\n\n-   They were not random, but attacked specific neighborhoods\n\n    -   Families of sympathizers were left alone \n\n    -   Victims belonged to three groups\n\n        -   Local opponents who supported incumbents \n\n        -   People supporting competing insurgent groups \n\n        -   Former sympathizers who switched allegiance (most targeted this group)\n\n### Definitions:\n\n-   **Massacre**\n\n    -   Defined narrowly as large-scale, face-to-face violence against civilians targeted in groups and in the context of a civil war.\n\n-   **Violence**\n\n    -   Measure in it most basic form: homicide \n\n## [Hjerm, M., Eger, M.A., Bohman, A. 2020.

To address this issue, this research aims to differentiate between the two.\n\n    -   conflation of tolerance with prejudice has made it difficult to understand what tolerance truly means and how it differs from dislike or disapproval of certain groups.\n\n    -   distinguishing analytically between tolerance and prejudice. \n\n    -   define tolerance as an abstract value orientation towards diversity, without focusing on specific groups, ideas, or behaviors. This allows authors to analyze tolerance both within societies and across different societies.\n\n    -   suggests that tolerance is best understood as a three-dimensional concept, involving acceptance of, respect for, and appreciation of difference.\n\n    -   found that only an appreciation of difference has the potential to reduce prejudice.\n\n        -   demonstrates the validity of these measures and their independence from welfare attitudes. \n\n        -   Results suggest that only an appreciation of difference can reduce prejudice, but relationship btwn tolerance/other outcomes remain unclear.\n\n-   There are two main approaches to studying tolerance. \n\n    -   The first sees tolerance as permitting something disliked, suggesting that prejudice is necessary for tolerance. \n\n        -   This view implies that one can only be tolerant if they've been prejudiced before. Empirical studies following this approach often start with the assumption that certain groups are widely disliked.\n\n        -   However, this method makes it hard to separate tolerance from prejudice in practice.\n\n    -   The second approach defines tolerance as a positive response to diversity itself, without requiring prior prejudice. \n\n        -   This view focuses on subjective reactions to diverse values, behaviors, and lifestyles. \n\n        -   Although this conceptualization is analytically distinct from prejudice, previous studies using this definition still rely on measures of prejudice, limiting our understanding of tolerance.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Both approaches have methodological issues. They either link tolerance closely to prejudice or fail to measure tolerance in a way consistent with its definition. \n\n    -   Additionally, previous research has often overlooked the multidimensionality of tolerance and lacks abstraction in its conceptualization and measurement. \n\n    -   To address these limitations, the study advances a new conception of tolerance and develops measures consistent with this definition, avoiding the pitfalls of previous approaches.\n\n    -   propose a new understanding of tolerance as a value orientation towards difference, which focuses on how individuals respond to diversity itself rather than merely putting up with disliked aspects. \n\n    -   This definition is abstract and distinct from previous concepts, not requiring the identification of objectionable groups or behaviors. \n\n-   draw on Forst's dimensions of tolerance: \n\n    -   Acceptance\n\n    -   respect for difference\n\n    -   appreciation of difference.\n\n        -   These dimensions represent different levels of engagement with diversity, ranging from basic acceptance to a deeper appreciation. \n\n        -   this approach allows for the measurement of various expressions of tolerance without relying on specific groups or behaviors, making our measures politically and temporally neutral. \n\n        -   This framework provides a clearer understanding of tolerance and facilitates its empirical investigation.\n\n        -   8 positively worded items were selected to capture three dimensions of tolerance: acceptance, respect, and appreciation. \n\n-   Descriptive statistics show moderate to high levels of tolerance among respondents\n\n## [Sears, David O., and Christia Brown. 2013. \"Childhood and Adult Political Development.\" Ch. 3 in Leonie Huddy, David O.

The use of this framework provides some helpful insights: \n\n1.  Is addresses the constant tension between continuity and change as played out throughout an individuals lifespan\n\n2.  It helps us to understand the origins of orientations that are politically consequential among adults, whether concerning politics specifically or intergroup relations. \n\n### Findings:\n\nThis review has suggested that partisan predispositions are most likely to be acquired in early development, if not quite as uniformly early as originally thought.\n\n\\\n\n-   The authors suggest that this is due the role of \"time\" which is treated as an independent variable that takes three forms\n\n    -   The persisting effects of early experiences\n\n    -   The major events or \"the times\" that characterize the environment an individual has experienced \n\n    -   The life stages of development - children, adolescents, adults all have different cognitive capabilities \n\n-   Based on the various ways fo thinking about time, the authors pose four alternative models of the full political life cycel that are often contrasted in the literature and which speak to Campbell's conception of party identification being shaped by early learning behavior, persistence, and later influence on voting behavior. \n\n    -   four alternative models of the full political life cycle have often been contrasted: \n\n    -   \\(1\\) persistence: the residues of preadult learning persist through life; \n\n    -   \\(2\\) a variant, impressionable years: orientations are particularly susceptible to influence in late adolescence and early adulthood, but tend to stabilize thereafter\n\n    -   \\(3\\) its major alternative, lifelong openness: individuals remain open to influence throughout later life, including by \"the times\"\n\n    -   \\(4\\) life cycle: people show distinctive specific propensities at different stages of life (this one is particularly difficult to pin down)\n\n### Definitions:\n\n-   The Life-History Perspective\n\n    -   a theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time.\n\n### Additional Things:\n\n\\\n\n-   The life history perspective of political development is a theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time. This perspective views political development as akin to the life cycle of an organism, with distinct stages of growth, maturation, decline, and potential renewal.\n\n\\\n\nKey features of the life history perspective of political development include:\n\n\\\n\n1.  **Stages of Development:** Similar to biological life cycles, political systems are seen to progress through various stages of development. These stages may include periods of consolidation, expansion, crisis, and transformation. Each stage is characterized by specific challenges, opportunities, and dynamics.\n\n2.  **Adaptation to Environmental Pressures:** Just as organisms adapt to their environments to survive and thrive, political systems must adapt to changing societal, economic, and environmental conditions. This may involve institutional reforms, policy adjustments, or shifts in political strategies to address new challenges or opportunities.\n\n3.  **Resource Allocation and Trade-offs:** The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resource allocation and trade-offs in political development. Political systems must allocate scarce resources, such as financial capital, human capital, and political capital, among competing priorities and objectives. Decisions about resource allocation may have long-term implications for the trajectory of political development.\n\n4.  **Reproduction and Inheritance:** Political systems often inherit institutional legacies, cultural norms, and social structures from previous generations. These inherited traits shape the opportunities and constraints faced by contemporary political actors and influence the trajectory of political development. Similarly, political systems may reproduce themselves through processes of institutional continuity, elite reproduction, and socialization.\n\n5.  **Variation and Diversity:** Just as biological organisms exhibit variation and diversity within and across species, political systems display variation and diversity in their structures, institutions, and practices. The life history perspective recognizes that different political systems may follow distinct trajectories of development due to historical legacies, cultural norms, and contextual factors.\n\n6.  **Adaptive Responses to External Shocks:** Political systems may face external shocks and disruptions, such as economic crises, wars, or natural disasters, that necessitate adaptive responses. The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resilience and flexibility in responding to external shocks and maintaining political stability and legitimacy.\n\nPartisanship is apparently a really salient predictor of mate choice lol \n\n## [Tajfel, Henri. 1982. \"Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations.\" Annual Review of Psychology 33(1): 1-39.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mLchlExlNAm-pkiHX0NpuEbTuIq74j6K/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**AWFUL READ! NEVER WRITE A LIT REVIEW LIKE THIS GUY!!!!**\n\n**I did my best to try to take the major themes of each section but he just throws every possible research paper on the subject at you. Literally a whirlwind of information.**\n\n### Introduction:\n\nIntergroup behavior: \"Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, collectively or individually, with another group or its members in terms of their group identification, we have an instance of intergroup behavior.\"\n\n### What is a group?:\n\n-   external : outside designations. Ex - bank clerks, hospital patients, etc.\n\n-   Internal: \"group identification\" \n\n    -   To achieve \"identification\" \n\n        -   cognitive - awareness and membership \n\n        -   Evaluative one - awareness is related to some value connotation\n\n        -   Emotional investment in awareness and evaluations. \n\n### Individual Process in Intergroup Behavior:\n\n1.  From Individual to Group Impressions\n\n    1.  **How cognitive structures determine certain aspects of intergroup attitudes.**\n\n        1.  We are trying to understand cognitive processes and relate it to interpersonal behavior.\n\n    2.  Discussion of stereotypes \n\n        1.  Cognitive mechanism: since members of minority groups often represent \"infrequent\" stimuli and therefore a conjunction of their relatively rare appearance with some of their actions lends itself to the construction of \"illusionary correlations\" and thus to stereotyping.\" \n\n    3.  Solo status research: When an individual is not part of the group or they are \"solo\" (think Black man with a group of white men), the Black man will have polarized evaluations compared with evaluations of the same person identified as belonging to the majority group. Aka more variation in view of Black man from white colleagues compared to less variation in view of white guy by white colleagues. \n\n        1.  Note: this is not equal across group identities. Some groups still face this issue more than others when the group is mixed. Seems kind of like a primitive concept of intersectionality being developed. \n\n### Group Membership and Intergroup Behavior\n\n1.  The Scope and range of Ethnocentrism\n\n    1.  Sumner coins term\n\n        1.  Also develops ingroup/outgroup\n\n        2.  Argues ethnocentrism is universal\n\n            1.  Not exactly true \n\n                1.

In sum, \"which differences are emphasized under what circumstances appears to be flexible and context dependent; this flexibility permits individuals to mobilize different group identities for different purposes.\"\n\n2.  The Development of Ethnocentrism\n\n    1.  Lots of debate \n\n    2.  Children adopt status + image of their group from outgroup (sometimes) \n\n        1.  Tension between status development from perception of both ingroup and outgroup\n\n    3.  The growth of group self respect in underprivileged minorities, closely related to socioeconomic, political, and psychological changes both inside the group and outside of it, would result in a corresponding decrease of ingroup devaluations and of low comparative expectancies. \n\n        1.  Long process. \n\n        2.  Sociopsych transformation is the effect of socioeconomic and political change. \n\n3.  Intergroup Conflict and Competition\n\n    1.  Interpersonal and intergroup behavior\n\n        1.  Two different approaches \n\n            1.  The \"interpersonal extreme\" defined as interaction between two or more individuals which is very largely determined by their individual characteristics and the nature of the personal relations between them - Deutsch\n\n            2.  The \"intergroup extreme\" defined as interactions which are largely determined by group memberships of the participants and very little-if at all-by their personal relations or individual characteristics. - sherif \n\n    2.  Intergroup conflict and group cohesion\n\n        1.  Does conflict promote greater cohesion inside the groups engaged in it? At the limit, can conflict create a cohesive group where only a loose structure existed before? \n\n            1.  Yes, but conditions. \n\n                1.  What happens if all members of a group are not equally affected by the conflict?\n\n                2.  Or when the consensus about threat, when it is dubious, cannot be transformed by the leadership into an \"authoritatively enforced cohesion\"?\n\n                3.  Or if a group is unable to deal with threat or to provide emotional support? \n\n        2.  There is a connection between in group cohesion and intergroup conflict\n\n    3.  Power and status in intergroup behavior \n\n        1.  Initially a peripheral focus in the field. But gaining steam. Four research trends \n\n            1.  Functioning of minorities\n\n            2.  The experimentally induced effects of intergroup power relations \n\n            3.  The effects of status on intergroup attitudes \n\n            4.  Role played in intergroup behavior by the perceived illegitimacy and/or instability of social differentials. \n\n4.  Social categorization and intergroup behavior \n\n    1.  Social categorization: cognitions, values, and groups \n\n        1.  Stereotypes are categorization.\n\n            1.  Cognitive function: resulting in the accentuation of similarities and differences, was the utilization of the category membership of individual items for ordering, systematizing, and simplifying the complex network of social groups confront individuals in their social environment\n\n            2.  Value functionL resulted in a still more emphatic accentuation of these same, similarities and differences when they were associated with subjective value differentials applying to social categories. \n\n            3.  \"As a result of the categorization process, within-group differences become minimized and between-group differences become exaggerated\"\n\n                1.  Salience of identity? \n\n            4.  The value and cognitive functions of social accentuation provide a basis for the understanding of the structure and direction of biases in intergroup attitudes and stereotypes, but they cannot tell us very much about the contents of the groups' reciprocal conceptions. \n\n    2.  Social categorization and intergroup discrimination\n\n        1.  Boys and holiday camp experiment. Once boys found out about other groups existence they started to form ingroup-outgroup identities before anything started. \n\n            1.  What are the minimal conditions that would create intergroup discrimination? \n\n        2.  Common fate\n\n    3.  Social identity and social comparison \n\n        1.  Social identity is defined as \"the part of the individuals' self-concept which derives from their knowledge of their membership of a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional significance of that membership.\" \n\n        2.  \"The social group is seen to function as a provider of positive social identity for its members through comparing itself, and distinguishing itself, from other comparison groups along salient dimensions which have a clear value differential\"\n\n### The Reduction of Intergroup Discrimination:\n\n### Intergroup Cooperation and superordinate Goals \n\n1.  Intergroup cooperation leads to less discrimination than intergroup competition. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n1.  Intergroup Contact\n\n    1.  It is just like one paragraph?

It overlooked the fact that democracy not only required popular participation but that elected leaders had also to govern, and that governing required obligation, patience, and trust. It was this necessary mix of activism and participation with other important ingredients that The Civic Culture celebrated.\" (preface) \n\n### Chapter 1: An Approach to Political Culture:\n\n-   Political culture of democracy and the social structures and processes that sustain it. \n\n    -   A new political world culture is developing. \n\n        -   \"Participation explosion\"\n\n    -   \"What must be learned about democracy is a matter of attitude and feeling, and this is harder to learn\". (p.4) \n\n-   **The Civic Culture:**\n\n    -   Combines modernity with tradition\n\n    -   A culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permeated change but moderated it\n\n    -   \"The working class could enter into politics and, in a process of trial and error, find the language in which to couch their demands and the means to make them effective\" (p.6) - kinda reminds me of historical institutionalism. \n\n    -   Individuals are not only oriented to political input, they are also orientated positively to the input structures and the input process. \n\n        -   The civic culture is a participant political culture in which the political culture and political structure are congruent. P.30 \n\n-   What is democratic culture? How does it spread? What attitudes and behaviors must be present to create democracy?\n\n-   Democracy is maintained by an active citizenry. More info, more involvement, and a sense of civic responsibility are essential. \n\n-   Looks at 5 countries: United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, and Mexico\n\n    -   A bit concerned about these choices. \n\n    -   These countries help escape an American focus - I disagree. \n\n-   **Political Culture:**\n\n    -   Refers specifically to political orientations - attitudes toward the political system and its various parts, and attitudes towards the role of the self in the system. \n\n    -   Psychological orientation to social objects. \n\n    -   When we speak of the political culture of a society, we refer to the political system as internalized in the cognitions, feelings, and evaluations of its population. People are inducted into it just as they are socialized into nonpolitical roles and social systems. P.13 \n\n-   The political culture of a nation is a particular distribution of patterns of orientation toward political objects among the members of a nation. What are those orientations? (see below) \n\n-   **Political Orientation:**\n\n    -   Orientation refers to the internalized aspects of objects and relationships.\n\n    -   Includes three types: \n\n        -   1\\) cognitive orientation - knowledge and belief about political system\n\n        -   2\\) affective orientation - feelings about political system \n\n        -   3\\) evaluational orientation - judgments and opinions about political objects \n\n-   We have classified orientation but we now must classify objects of political orientation. \n\n    1.  System as general object \n\n    2.  Input objects  \n\n    3.  Output objects \n\n    4.  Self as object \n\n-   Characterizing political culture is done by understanding the various orientations toward the various objects. The types of political culture according to the authors are: \n\n    1.  Parochial Political Culture\n\n    2.  Subject Political Culture \n\n    3.  Participant Political Culture \n\n-   \"In the civic culture participant political orientations combine with and do not replace subject and parochial political orientations. Individuals become participants in the political process, but they do not give up their orientations as subjects or parochials.\" p.30 \n\n-   \"Thus attitudes favorable to participation within the political system play a major role in the civic culture, but so do such nonpolitical attitudes as trust in other people and social participation in general. The maintenance of these more traditional attitudes and their fusion with the participant orientations lead to a balanced political culture in which political activity, involvement, and rationality exist but are balanced by passivity, traditionality, and commitment to parochial values.\" p.30\n\n-   **The connecting link between micro and macro politics is political culture.**\n\n-   Survey of 5 nations - 1000 interviews in each country. Interviews take place in 1959. US takes place in 1960\n\n### Chapter 2: Patterns of Political Cognition\n\n-   Recall the classification types of political culture: Parochial, Subject, Participant. \n\n    -   Of the 5 countries - parochial and subject are rare. \n\n1.  Measures of cognitive content and processes:\n\n    1.  How much importance is attributed to national and local government\n\n    2.  Awareness and exposure of and exposure to politics and public affairs \n\n    3.  Political information adult population possesses \n\n    4.  Measure of the readiness of these populations to make choices or entertain opinions about political issues and problems.\n\n-   The impact of government: To what extent do the people in these countries perceive government as having an effect on them as individuals? To what extent do they see their lives as related to the activities of governments? \n\n    -   Americans and British respondents in the great majority perceive an impact of their national and local governments and ascribe high favorability \n\n    -   Germans are similar but a larger percentage are more skeptical in saying the governments sometime improved conditions \n\n    -   Italians attribute high favorability to gov \n\n    -   Minority of Mexicans attribute significance to the government and is skeptical in the benefits of the government. \n\n    -   From the results the authors say: \n\n        -   US, Britain, German are bulk \"allegiants\" \n\n        -   Italy, and mexico (mainly mexico) are majority subject and parochial. \n\n    -   Education correlated with awareness of the significance of the government\n\n-   Awareness of politics: Do people pay attention to political and governmental affairs (even campaigns)?\n\n    -   The civic culture, as we use the term, includes a sense of obligation to participate in political input activities, as well as a sense of competence to participate. \n\n    -   Education correlated with higher interest.\n\n-   Having information and Opinions: Can people identify national leaders and can people identify cabinet offices or departments at the national level of government? \n\n    -   Germans, English, and Americans have higher well-informed respondents. \n\n    -   Mexico the worst\n\n    -   Except italy, low information high opinions are common\n\n    -   british , American, and germans are more cognitively oriented to the input and output of government\n\n        -   Mexicans and Italians are alienated and parochial.\n\n### Chapter 3: Feeling Toward Government and Politics\n\n-   Generalized attitudes toward the whole: toward the nation, its virtues, accomplishments,\n\n    -   System affect: see above \n\n        -   National pride \n\n            -   \"Speaking generally, what are the aspects of this country that you are most proud of?\"\n\n            -   Italians have more pride in items not related to politics \n\n            -   Americans and British had higher rates of indicating government/political/public policy items. \n\n            -   Germans are less prideful in politics. More prideful in science contributions, economy, and personal virtues. \n\n            -   Mexicans are interested in politics and have high political pride\n\n                -   Is the Mexican revolution responsible?\n\n            -   Better occupation correlates with more political pride \n\n                -   Except in germany and Italy \n\n                    -   Suggests alienation from system\n\n                        -   Both have fascist past? \n\n    -   Output affect: expectations of treatment by government and police\n\n        -   Attitudes toward the executive/gov affecting respondents. \n\n        -   If expected to treat fairly then we expect favorability to government authority from respondent \n\n        -   Respondents were asked two hypotheticals \n\n            -   Mexicans continually are more alienated\n\n            -   Police had high favorability...more than government officials - except in mexico. \n\n    -   Input affect \n\n        -   Feelings people have about the agencies and processes involved in the election of public officials and enactment of general public policies. \n\n        -   Concerned with face-to-face communication.\n\n        -   Measures:\n\n            -   How much do respondents report discussing politics \n\n                -   Talking politics is an active form of politics\n\n                    -   Mass media is passive \n\n                        -   Are people becoming more passive in politics? \n\n                -   Talking politics also indicates some sense of safety in political communication.\n\n## [Avdeenko, Alexandra, and Michael J.

What elements of the communist experience explain this?\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n1.  Civic participation lags in post-communist countries due to (1) mistrust of Communist organizations, (2) the persistence of friendship networks (private networks), and (3) post-Communist disappointment.\n\n2.  For societal change to occur and last, (1) new institutions must be authoritative and binding, (2) they should build upon existing traditions and culture, and (3) several decades and generations are needed to change people's habits and acculturation.\n\n### Data:\n\n-   1995-1997 World Values Survey and Post-Communist Organizational Membership Study (PCOMS) survey of 1999\n\n### Methods:\n\n-   Multivariate OLS regression analysis\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Participation in voluntary organizations is much lower in post-communist countries in Eastern Europe than in the older democracies and post-authoritarian countries (with exception of labor unions).\n\n### Questions:\n\n1.  Looking closely at the descriptive data and the OLS results, do we see Eastern Germany more closely associated with Russia or with Western Germany? Why do you think this is? How well does this fit with Howard's hypothesis?\n\n2.  Is this generalizable? (LOLOLOLOL)\n\n3.  Do you buy voluntary organization participation as a measure of civil societal health? Why or why not?\n\n4.  If you wanted to expand upon this study (or even replicate it), how would you design it differently?\n\n### General Note:\n\n-   This book explores how people adapt to a new democracy (looking at post-communist Europe)\n\n    -   Specifically focused on civil society as crucial part of public space between state and family, and embodied in **voluntary organizations**\n\n    -   Seeks to explain why post-communist civil society is weak\n\n-   Post-Communist Europe\n\n    -   Remarkably low rates of participation in voluntary organizations of civil society\n\n    -   Non-democratic countries not represented\n\n    -   2 scholarly approaches:\n\n        -   Contemporary political and economic attributes and policies the most important factors explaining and predicting cross-national variation\n\n        -   Causal variables are legacies of communism -- historical/cultural context\n\n    -   Societal similarities resistant to change even while political institutions have\n\n-   Case studies\n\n    -   Russia & East Germany\n\n        -   Economic levels high in East Germany but low in Russia\n\n        -   Political and legal institutions well developed in EG but Russian systems weak and underdeveloped\n\n        -   Both societies belong to different cultural and religious civilizations\n\n        -   Substantial variation provides maximal analytic leverage for explaining causes of similarly low levels of civic participation\n\n-   The Organization of the Book\n\n    -   Theory\n\n    -   Empirical results\n\n    -   Causal explanation using 2 different methodological approaches\n\n        -   \"Experiential\" approach to societal continuity and change = individuals are agents who make choices\n\n        -   **For societal change to occur and last, 3 factors must take place:**\n\n1.  **New institutions must be authoritative and binding.**\n\n2.  **Institutions should build upon existing traditions and culture.**\n\n3.  **Several decades and generations are needed to change people's habits and acculturation.**\n\n-   Ch. 2: 3 main individual-level causal factors that guide empirical analysis:\n\n1.  Most post-communist citizens still strongly mistrust and avoid organizations, even now that participation is voluntary.\n\n2.  Many of the private and informal networks that developed under communism -- because of the politicization and state control of the public sphere, as well as the shortage economy -- still persist today in an altogether new institutional environment, and they serve as a disincentive for many people to join formal organizations.\n\n3.  Many post-communist citizens are extremely dissatisfied with the new political and economic system which hasn't lived up to their hopes and ideals, and their disappointment has caused them to withdraw even further from public activities.\n\n-   Ch. 3: conceptual analysis of civil society\n\n    -   Linz & Stepan's 5 \"arenas\" of democratization:\n\n1.  Civil society\n\n2.  Political society\n\n3.  Economic society\n\n4.  The rule of law\n\n5.

business associations, professional organizations, reading clubs, film clubs, sports clubs, NGOs, trade unions, and cadre-based political parties\n\n    -   Everyday forms of engagement = informal civic interaction;

This paper tests the internet's effect at a more antecedent and foundational stage of political behavior. Past literature looks at the internet's influence after people have already moved to act and organize. \n\n2.  The second contribution is methodological. A field experiment can provide direct causal tests. This is a first for this body of research.\n\n### Theory:\n\nWhy would the internet have an effect on political organization?\n\n\"Mirror-Holding\" - The internet enables more people to mirror hold. What does this mean? \n\n-   The Internet holds up a mirror for users to better discern and reflect on how their government is actually performing. \n\n-   The global nature of the Internet also opens more panoramic windows that better enable individuals to view how governments function in other countries, particularly the high-functioning democracies that tend to be most visible on the Internet. This provides users with a more realistic and globally consistent scale by which to make comparative evaluations about their own government's performance. \n\nThe internet provides more information to citizens, from a broader range of perspectives, than would otherwise be the case-thus improving the capacity of citizens to make more informed evaluations of their governments. \n\n-   Reminds me a bit of Kevin Munger supply and demand perspective of youtube. \n\nBy providing a venue to publicly document government's failure or abuses, often coupled with pictures and videos, individuals more readily link their personal experiences to a much larger, pervasive, and entrenched national trend.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nThis the internet will provide a more robust and different set of information regarding the integrity of the Tanzania election compared to that provided by the traditional media.\n\n### Method:\n\nField Experiment:\n\n-   Focus: 2010 Tanzania elections \n\n    -   Why?: 2010 elections were not deemed fully free and fair? \n\n        -   Uchaguzi (an internet platform) allowed people to create a visual map of where election abuses were reported - allowing citizens to view and reflect on it. \n\n        **Unit of analysis:** Tanzanian individuals \n\n    Subjects were recruited in person at several congregation points in the community of Morogoro. Morgogoro is 120 miles away from the economic capital. 200k population. 200 names were collected. Using random assignment, 70 respondents were given the internet treatment and 70 respondents were given the no-internet control condition. \n\n    Subjects were asked to meet at internet cafes. Pre Surveys were given. Individuals then had access to the internet at the cafe for 2 months. Control group was not given internet time but would gain it after the experiment was over. No restrictions were put on how respondents used the internet. After 2 months, respondents were contacted again for a post survey.\n\n### Results:\n\n-   Treatment group had less faith in a fair election and believed the recount was less fair. \n\n-   Users with facebook accounts were more likely to think the election was unfair.\n\n-   Treatment was also more likely to trust the police force.\n\n-   \\*\\*\\*Internet users who became more aware of electoral abuses also may have become less likely to believe that their vote mattered as a consequence. While some protested, others simply stayed home. \n\n    -   The internet may be a double edged sword. \n\n-   The internet can alter the cost-benefit calculus of political behavior by expanding the range of information individuals have regarding their government's actual performance.\n\n-   Members of the disaffected Internet group were less likely to vote. \n\n    -   Showing internet is not the amazing positive force we thought it was \n\n        -   This is obvious now but in 2010 not so much! \n\n### Stone's Thoughts:\n\nI love this article! The theory section regarding how the internet influences political behavior is really intuitive. I think I have a good understanding for how the internet influenced all of us and how it culminated into Trump and the polarization across the world. Let me (attempt) to explain my perspective. \n\n-   For the masses: The internet increased communication and information (duh). As Bailard points out, this changes the cost-benefit analysis for individuals to FORM political opinions. In essence, it becomes easier to engage in politics because it reduces the cost to do so. Information can be obtained so readily and easy that people can engage and it seems Bailard shows this to be the case. As a result, the SUPPLY of voters/individuals interested in politics, increases. \n\n-   For elites: The internet provides a new platform for people to engage in politics. Prior to the internet, the barrier to become an elite was much more difficult. The internet democratized who can be an elite. Youtube, facebook, etc. provided a space for anyone to become an elite. This increased the SUPPLY of elites (look at Kevin Munger's work). The greater supply of elites introduced greater VARIATION in ideology of the elite class (this is how you get polarization to increase as more and more people are expressing different viewpoints). The increased variation of ideology in the elite class spills over into the information and cues they provide to the masses. Because it is easier to be an elite and share information, the masses now have greater access to the variation in perspectives. In short, there used to be a strong barrier towards becoming an elite, perhaps gated by education, money, network, etc; however, the internet basically allows anyone to become an elite and provide cues to people. \n\n-   There is a greater SUPPLY of informed voters, SUPPLY of elites, SUPPLY of information and that is what might be driving our polarized epoch. \n\n    -   Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\n## [Mishler, William, and Richard Rose. 2001. \"What are the origins of Political Trust? Testing Institutional and Cultural Theories in Post-communist Societies.\" Comparative Political Studies 34(1): 30-62.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MWT6y6eK_oKX_JRIOy0NeksB8TUnRMTc/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\n\"Micro-level institutional arrangements are the source of political trust.\"\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhat is the source of political trust?\n\n### Purpose:\n\nUnderstanding how trust begins is important for the consolidation of new democracies. There are competing explanations for the sources of political trust. Some hypotheses stress exogenous determinants  (these are considered cultural theories) while others stress endogenous determinants (these are considered institutional theories). Both can take micro- and macro-level forms. The authors set out to assess which determinants are stronger.\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\n1.  (National Culture): Trust in political institutions varies between countries rather than among individuals according to historically rooted, national experiences embedded in interpersonal structure.\n\n2.  (Individual socialization): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries according to individuals' trust in others as shaped by their places in the social structure.\n\n3.  (Government performance): Trust in institutions varies across rather than within countries in proportion to the success of government policies and the character of political institutions.\n\n4.  (Individual evaluations): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries in accordance with both individuals attitudes and values and the social and economic positions individuals occupy.\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Strongly support the superiority of **institutional explanations (endogenous)** of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. \n\n-   The effects of **macro-political and economic performance** on trust are indirect and mediated at the micro level by an individual's value-laden perceptions\n\n-   Contrary to cultural theories, **interpersonal trust varies** widely within societies and has little appreciable effect on institutional trust at either the aggregate or individual levels\n\n-   micro-institutional hypothesis (Hypothesis 4) is confirmed, and the other hypotheses (Hypothesis 1 through Hypothesis 3) are rejected.\n\n**Building trust: (p. 56)** Trust can be nurtured by improving the conduct and performance of political institutions. Governments can generate public trust the old-fashioned way: They can earn it by responding promptly and effectively to public priorities, rooting out corrupt practices, and protecting new freedoms (Hetherington, 1998, reaches similar conclusions). Political institutions also can earn trust through economic policies that promise and ultimately provide a better material future for the country as a whole.\n\n### Methods:\n\n-   Data - data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. \n\n    -   Aggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with **survey data** on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. \n\n\\\n\n-   **Survey data** (p. 40) analyzed here come from the fifth New Democracies Barometer (NDB V), organized by the Paul Lazarsfeld Society, Vienna, and the seventh New Russia Barometer (NRB VII), organized by the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde.\n\n    -   NDB interviews were conducted between January 1998 and May 1998 in seven Central and East European countries---Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia---and in two successor states of the former Soviet Union, Belarus and Ukraine. \n\n    -   Professional survey firms conducted face-to-face interviews using national probability samples of approximately 1,000 in each country. \n\n    -   In addition, NRB interviews were conducted in Russia by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion in March 1998 and April 1998 using a multistage national probability sample that yielded 1,904 face-to-face interviews \n\n-   To test the effects of both national context and individual differences\n\n    -   Pooled the survey data from the 10 countries in a single multinational file of **11,499 respondents.**\n\n    -   Each country was weighted equally as **having 1,000 cases**, and a variety of macro-contextual and aggregate performance variables were added to the merged data set so that respondents could be analyzed in terms of both their individual attributes and their national contexts.\n\n-   Institutional trust was measured using the question \"There are many different institutions in the country, for example, the government, courts, police, civil servants. Please show me on this 7-point scale, where 1 represents great distrust and 7 represents trust, how much is your personal trust in each of the following institutions?\"\n\n-   Then were asked \"how much do you trust most people you meet?\"\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   When testing micro theories\n\n    -   **Five proxies for political socialization** are included in the model: age, education, gender, town size, and church attendance.\n\n    -   **Five political performance measures** also are used, including the aggregate index of political corruption and micro-level perceptions of personal freedom, government fairness, political corruption, and government responsiveness to citizen influence.\n\n### Definitions:\n\n-   **Cultural Theories -** view trust as exogenous to political institutions and are a basic character trait learned early in life.\n\n    -   **Micro-Theories -** focus on differences in individual socialization experiences as sources of significant variation in political trust within as well as between societies.\n\n    -   **Macro-Theories -** emphasize the homogenizing tendencies of national traditions and make little allowance for variation in trust among individuals within societies\n\n-   **Institutional Theories -** view trust as endogenous and as a consequence of institutional performance.\n\n    -   **Micro-Theories -** emphasize the aggregate performance of institutions in such matters as promoting growth, governing effectively, and avoiding corruption.\n\n        -   The outputs of institutional trust are assumed to determine individual responses.\n\n    -   **Macro-Theories -** emphasize that individual evaluations of institutional performance are conditioned by individual tastes and experiences\n\n        -   Such as whether a person thinks that political integrity or economic growth is more important and whether that individual personally has experienced the effects of corruption or the benefits of economic growth. \n\n-   **Macro-Theories** - emphasize that trust is a collective or group property broadly shared by all members of a society\n\n-   **Micro-Theories -** hold that trust varies among individuals within a society based on differences in socialization and social background, political and economic experiences, or individual perceptions and evaluations.\n\n-   **Lifetime-Learning Model -** A model that integrates early-life socialization and adult learning, thereby allowing direct empirical comparisons.\n\n### Abstract:\n\nPopular trust in political institutions is vital to democracy, but in post-Communist countries, popular distrust for institutions is widespread, and prospects for generating increased political trust are uncertain given disagreements over its origins. Cultural theories emphasizing exogenous determinants of trust compete with institutional theories emphasizing endogenous influences, and both can be further differentiated into micro and macro variants. Competing hypotheses drawn from these theories are tested using data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Aggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with survey data on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. Results strongly support the superiority of institutional explanations of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. This encourages cautious optimism about the potential for nurturing popular trust in new democratic institutions.\n\n## [Mutz, Diana C., and Byron Reeves. 2005. \"The New Videomalaise: Effects of Televised Incivility on Political Trust.\" American Political Science Review 99 (1):1-15.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vw6A83Zred_EWbHHL_VT8E-kd-15mQ_4/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nRude TV debates depress political trust!\n\n### IV:\n\nIncivility between political opponents on TV\n\n### DV:\n\nTrust in government and politicians\n\n### Research Question:\n\nDoes televised political incivility harm levels of trust in government and politicians?\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nWhen political actors violate interpersonal social norms on television, viewers react as they would if they were witnessing the same interaction in real life; they react negatively to incivility.\n\n### Data:\n\n-   3 survey experiments with pre-test, experiment, and post-test\n\n### Methods:\n\n-   Respondents put into 1 of 3 experimental groups and difference of means test conducted on pre- and post-test survey results after respondents watched fictional TV program of political debate with either civil or uncivil exchange:\n\n    -   Experiment 1 subjects randomly assigned to civil or uncivil conditions (n = 67)\n\n    -   Experiment 2 included a 3rd control condition where subjects didn't watch any political TV (n = 155)\n\n    -   Experiment 3 used within-subjects design where all were assigned to both civil and uncivil conditions in random order to understand process of influence\n\n-   Political trust measured from National Election Studies under rubric of support for the political system\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Hypotheses confirmed! Individuals are negatively impacted by uncivil exchanges on televised political discourse as evidenced by lower trust in government on surveys following exposure.\n\n### Questions:\n\n1.  Mutz and Reeves write that \"when political actors engage in TV interactions that violate the norms for everyday, face-to-face discourse, they reaffirm viewers' sense that politicians cannot be counted on to obey the same norms for social behavior by which ordinary citizens abide\" (2). Does this work in the opposite direction? If politicians began treating each other respectfully on televised debates, would we expect to see an increase in political trust and that would translate into greater political participation?\n\n2.  Related to the question above -- if we assume that academic literature is the dominant civil medium for research-backed discourse, and that this discourse is important for policy change, institutional stability, and informed public participation in politics, how do we amplify its reach?\n\n3.  If this study were repeated today, would the results hold? Do we agree that people expect political actors to act civilly toward each other? And if not, is this partly due to the dwindling approval ratings overall of our politicians and our political institutions?\n\n### General Notes:\n\n-   Television and political trust\n\n    -   Robinson popularized term \"videomalaise\" in 1975 to refer to attitudes that resulted from watching television news\n\n    -   Evidence supporting the causal claim that television is responsible for low levels of political trust has been limited\n\n        -   Claims have broadened into general critique of political journalism\n\n    -   Main emphasis of research has been on the extent to which televised politics heightens the importance of personality characteristics in general evaluations of candidates\n\n        -   Candidates' personal qualities more important to voters who obtained political news from TV (Keeter 1987)\n\n        -   TV primes people to rely more on personality perceptions when evaluating candidates (Druckman 2003)\n\n    -   Social psychology theories of human-media interaction suggest that TV political disagreements would exacerbate the \"intensification of feeling\" Lippmann described in 1925\n\n        -

  People expect political actors who appear on television to abide by the same social norms acknowledged by ordinary Americans\n\n        -   People react negatively to incivility (even if it's on TV)\n\n    -   Experience of political conflict on TV substantially different from real life\n\n        -   Need for politeness is particularly great when expressing controversial views (Kingwell 1995)\n\n        -   Politeness and respect toward individuals involved in a legal conflict enhances their perceptions of fair treatment (Tyler 1990)\n\n    -   Television world provides uniquely intimate perspective on conflicts\n\n        -   When social norms for civility are violated on TV, viewers' intimate perspective intensifies an already negative reaction to incivility\n\n        -   Reeves & Nass (1996) show that when motion appears on TV, physiological responses are the same as when motion occurs in the immediate environment -- the human brain hasn't evolved quickly enough to respond in rational ways to technologies such as TV\n\n    -   When encountering differences of opinion in person, people tend to downplay differences and maintain a polite, cordial atmosphere\n\n        -   In contrast, TV emphasizes conflict and strong differences of opinion to enhance dramatic value and attract viewers\n\n        -   TV is also a highly intimate medium\n\n            -   Central hypothesis: **This violation of social norms should cause negative reactions toward politicians and government**\n\n                -   People expect others to obey social norms and evaluate them less favorably when they don't\n\n                -   Given that the normative expectation is one of civility, this influence should be primarily a function of negative reactions to incivility rather than positive reaction s to civility\n\n                -

  2 versions of each exchange taped\n\n                    -   Candidates expressed exactly same position in same words in both versions, offered same arguments, but civil exchanges were VERY civil and uncivil exchanges took personal jabs, raised voices, and never apologized (as well as rude nonverbal reactions)\n\n        -   Figure 1 shows results: candidates in uncivil versions of issue exchanges consistently perceived as less polite, more quarrelsome, more emotional, agitated, and hostile\n\n            -   2 null findings: no perceived ideological differences in a candidate's stand in civil vs. uncivil condition\n\n-   Procedures\n\n    -

If so, how?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\n-   Develops  a theory that accounts for the variety of ways in which pro- and anti- gay-rights actors engage with the media, which generates clear expectations about how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs.\n\n-   The author argues that increased overall media consumption enhances support for LGBTQs, but that this effect is driven by consumption of newspaper, internet and social media. This is because government censorship of queer content is often directed at television programs that contain positive representations of LGBTQs.\n\n-   The media impacts public opinion of the LGBTQ+ community through (1) exposing individuals to positive representation and (2) exposing individuals to new information in general\n\n### Findings:\n\n1.  Different types of media produce distinct effects on public opinions of LGBTQ+ people\n\n    1.  Radio and television have no significant effect on pro-gay attitudes\n\n    2.

Despite extensive research on how the media affects public opinion, including studies that show how exposure to certain information can increase support of LGBTQs, there is virtually no research on how the media influences attitudes towards LGBTQs across Africa. This study develops a theory that accounts for actors' mixed approach to the media and shows how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs. Specifically, the study finds that radio and television have no, or a negative, significant effect on pro-gay attitudes, whereas individuals who consume more newspapers, internet or social media are significantly more likely to support LGBTQs (by approximately 2 to 4 per cent). The author argues that these differential effects are conditional on censorship of queer representation from certain mediums. The analysis confirms that the results are not driven by selection effects, and that the relationship is unique to LGBTQ support but not other social attitudes. The results have important implications, especially given the growing politicization of same-sex relations and changing media consumption habits across Africa.\n\n# Week 14: Electoral Participation\n\n## [Aguilar, Edwin Eloy, and Alexander Pacek. 2000. \"Macroeconomic Conditions, Voter Turnout, and the Working Class/Economically Disadvantaged Party Vote in Developing Countries.\" Comparative Political Studies 33(8): 995-1017.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XoGrm7M5Dd1mhhpwSCQDW3nXFK5syW9C/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nThe lower class mobilizes in developing countries during economic downturns!\n\n### Research Question:\n\nTo what extent and in what manner do fluctuations in voter turnout affect support for parties with working-class/lower status concerns in the developing world?

At the time, people were moving away from RCT, Aldrich argues that it is still useful and can't help us get closer to explaining why some people vote and others do not. \n\n### Goal:\n\nUse rational choice to help us understand why some people vote and others do not. \n\n-   We can find variables that increase or decrease the likelihood of turning out. But they never in an absolute sense tell us above. \n\n### The Basic Model:\n\n-   Preferences determine behavior \n\n    -   Rat choice is about HOW those preferences determine behavior\n\n-   A citizen's preferences are realized in the outcome. We infer a voters preference through the action of who they vote for. \n\n    -   Citizens' preferences are transformed into utilities for outcomes when it matters how much the citizen prefers one outcome over another. \n\n-   Conclusions of basic model: \n\n    -   Never vote for the less preferred candidate\n\n    -   If costs of voting are high, always abstain\n\n    -   If costs of voting are zero, then vote for A because voting for A dominates abstaining \n\n    -   If cost is between 0 and 5, the basic model is silent. Rational choice models of turnout differ over ways to handle these cases. See figure 1.\n\n### Rat Choice:\n\nRational choice theories are theories about the (expected) utility associated with outcomes generates or induces preferences for the particular actions at hand. \n\n-   Fundamental is that rat choice argues that whichever outcome has a higher utility (1,0), the individual will choose actions to receive the higher utility outcome. \n\n-   Actions are instruments to achieve outcomes\n\n-   The action of voting is an instrument to achieve the desired outcome. \n\n### Cost of Voting:\n\n-   Voting is not a costless action. \n\n    -   You have to obtain information, process it, decide what to do. \n\n    -   You have to go to the polls. \n\n-   Some people say that not voting is costless\n\n    -   Aldrich disagrees, rational abstainers must pay cost of deciding to vote or not. \n\n-   Cost of voting is represented as, C\n\n-   C \\> 0 \n\n-   When costs are high -\\> voter turnout decreases\n\n    -   \"When registration laws were passed, poll taxes were raised, or residency requirements were enacted, turnout fell.\n\nVoters must still give some thought to what others might do. That factors into the voters choice to act. \n\n-   If the voter thinks that their candidate will lose considerably, they probably will be less likely to vote. \n\n    -   THE PROBLEM: voters do not know the situation they face.\n\n### The Calculus of Voting Model:\n\n-   Initially developed by Downs and extended by Riker. \n\n    -   Controversial addition to the model. The term D\n\n    -   D represents the value of seeing democracy continue. If noe voted, Downs argued the political system would fail and thus some vote to ensure the continued vitality of democracy.\n\n        -   Riker continues this - change it to \"citizens duty\" \n\n-   Adding a D term is the same as subtracting a C term. \n\n    -   More of a sense of citizen duty can counter the cost of voting. \n\n    -   D does not change anything unless D \\> C. \n\n-   CRITICAL INNOVATION TO CALCULUS OF VOTING MODEL: \n\n    -   Each person assigns a probability of the state of the world being true. \n\n        -   **The probability that one vote will make a difference.**\n\n-   Can be summed up through the equation: \n\n    -   R = PB + D - C\n\n        -   If R is positive, vote for candidate A (voters preferred candidate) if not, abstain.\n\n        -   R = Rewards \n\n        -   P = Probability of one vote breaking a tie \n\n        -   B = difference in utility for candidate A instead of B winning (diff in benefits) \n\n        -   D = citizen duty\n\n        -   C = cost of voting \n\n    -   Higher P = higher voter turnout \n\n    -   C, D, and B are strong predictors of turnout.\n\n-   Problems with the Calculus of Voting model\n\n    -   D term is hotly debated \n\n        -   If you vote because \"you wanted to\" then voting is not instrumental towards an outcome.\n\n            -   Rat choices are models of how one acts, given tastes. They are not models of where \"taste\" comes from. \n\n    -   The P term is not realistic. It is not reasonable to assume your vote will break a tie. \n\n### The Minimax Regret Model\n\n-   Developed by Ferejohn and Fiorina \n\n-   Reject completing the basic model. \n\n    -   They argue people's ability to form probability assessments of the state of the world is basically too difficult and near impossible. \n\n        -   If these probability assessments cannot be formed, they argue that the calculus of the voting model can not be used. \n\n-   Instead of expected utility maximization, they propose a decision rule called minimax regret\n\n    -   Suppose a voter decided to abstain. Their preferred candidate loses by one vote. That voter would be regretful of their decision. \n\n        -   Thus they measure the level of regret \n\n-   Minimax regret refers to taking the action that yields the minimum of these maximum regrets. \n\n    -   This model differs in what to do on the middle columns as seen in figure 1. \n\n-   They argue their model is better than the calculus model and better predicts turnout more often.\n\n-   Problems with the Minimax Regret Model: \n\n    -   P term is still an issue \n\n        -   P at least exist but is small \n\n            -   Honestly this was a bit over my head. See page 259 - was confused. \n\n    -   Second issue is the wasted voting undermines the plausibility of minimax regret \n\n### A Third Approach - Game Theoretic Accounts:\n\n-   Aldrich the other models have problems \n\n-   Tho other models are based on decision theory\n\n    -   No one decision is assumed to affect the decisions of others. \n\n        -   The decisions of others are highly aggregated \n\n-   Game theory models do not make this mistake and assume that decisions are based on taking others' decisions into explicit account. \n\n    -   Wait but aldrich says that problems in the calculus model are still at least somewhat present in game theory models \n\n        -   ????????????????????\n\n### The Rationality of Turnout:\n\n-   Turnout is cheap \n\n-   Information gain is asymmetric \n\n-   Elections differ in salience and impact.\n\n-   Turnout is still a collective action problem BUT not a good example. Collective action problems typically assume importance because they are high-cost, high benefit decisions, where small P terms mean that the high B terms are substantially discounted. Turnout is a low cost, low benefit decision and she's little light on most important collective action problems. \n\n### Strategic Politicians and Rational Choice Turnout:\n\n### A strategic politician explains why turnout is higher in close elections. \n\n-   More investment into close contests and this will be reflected in increasing levels of turnout. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Strategic politicians inform voters of the wasted-vote argument and convince at least some voters that it is sensible to act ast strategic voters \n\n    -   I forget the name but there is a new book out that discusses how and where candidates go to campaign (physically). He basically finds that campaign events don't really do anything other than increase turnout. \n\n## Blais, André. 2009. \"Turnout in Elections.\" OHPB.

It moves from research at the aggregate level, including why there is country level variation in voter turnout and finishes on individual level research review and why people vote.\n\n### IV:\n\nsocio-econ environment, party system, level of development, electoral rules such as compulsory, institutional structure, importance of election/ Resource model, psychological model, mobilization model, rational choice theory/Generational replacement and lowering of age, fractionalization of party system, declining group mobilization \n\n### DV:\n\nWhat accounts for voter turnout variation in the aggregate/individually/why is there a decline starting in the 1990s \n\n### Outcome:\n\n1.  Patterns and Trends: A total of 533 elections and 106 countries are included. All democratic legislative elections (1972-2004), mean turnout 75% and stable with variation in the 3 points range. Variation in country is around 5 points. No central tendency. Turnout decline over time of 8 to 9 points. Higher in established democracies (29 countries) and slightly higher in presidential elections. \n\n2.  Explaining Turnout Variations across Countries: Three sets of factors have been identified: the socioeconomic environment, the institutional set-up, and the party system (Powell 1982; Blais and Dobrzynska 1998). Difference between poor and other countries (undistinguishable amongst the wealthy). Compulsory system affect turnout with a 10-15 points higher turnout (not sure if it is about the sanctions). PR and high magnitude, higher turnout /= in Latin America. Important elections and relative power of the seat at stake=higher turnout/ with a caveat (Blais 2000). Higher leverage of lower house predicts best higher turnout. Facility of voting does not produce measurable findings. Turnout appears to be higher when there are less parties in contention. \"Closeness\" of the results might have an effect. No real consensus on this.\n\n3.  Explaining the Recent Turnout Decline: three reasons for the 9 points decline since 1990 1) Generational replacement, Degree of competition of the election (Franklin). + voting age lowering is not a culprit , 2) Fractionalization in party system, 3)declining group mobilization (especially where union density has subsided). Not completely set\n\n4.  The Decision to Vote or not to Vote: age and education are the two most significant factors, followed by religiosity, income, and marital status (Blais 2000).\n\n## [Franklin, Mark N. 2004.

The idea is that if separated powers are bad for turnout, then anything that accentuates this separation should reduce turnout still further. \n\n    -   Divided government as a variable \n\n-   Turnout in midterm elections is correlated with turnout in the following presidential election more than the association between the previous presidential election. \n\n-   If an elections is felt to be a foregone conclusion, it makes sense less people will vote.\n\nAn inventory of variables affecting electoral competition \n\n-   Executive responsiveness \n\n-   Margin of victory \n\n-   Size of electorate \n\n-   Time since previous election \n\nShort term vs. long term effects\n\n### Chapter 5: **Explaining Turnout Change in Twenty-Two Countries (more substantive chapter)**\n\nThis chapter gets at the main question of: What causes turnout change? Further we can better understand the decline in turnout that has occurred in recent years.\n\n#### Focus:\n\n22 countries 1945 - 1999. ONLY look at lower house election data. Authors do not look at presidential elections or midterms.\n\nFeatures that relate to the utility and costs of voting are the primary motivating forces that drive voter turnout. \n\n-   Other variables include \n\n-   Electoral type \n\n-   Proportionality of electoral system \n\n-   Extent of the franchise \n\n-   Whether absentee ballots are permitted \n\n-   Whether voting is compulsory \n\n-   District magnitude \n\n-   Election over weekend \n\n-   Closeness of race \n\n-   Intervals of election \n\n-   Size of electorate \n\n-   Size of largest party \n\n-   Polarization \n\n-   See page 121 for more.\n\n#### Hypothesis:\n\n1.  We expect Signficnat effects from the following variables operationalized as short-term factors: time since the previous election, weekend voting majority status of the largest party, margin of victory of the largest party, mean margin of victory across the districts in majoritarian systems, polarization and cohesion of the party system, decisiveness of the election, and disproportionality of the electoral system \n\n2.  We expect significant effects from the following variables operationalized as cumulative factors: compulsory voting, absentee voting, female empowerment, extension of the franchise to eighteen year olds, size of electorate, average district magnitude, and the responsiveness of the executive to the political complexion of the legislature \n\n3.  We expect a significant effect of past turnout \n\n4.  We do not expect any features of the character of elections that can vary over time to prove significant except when operationalized as a short-term or cumulative factor. \n\nH1 mainly involves electoral competitiveness, h2 mainly involves process of generational replacement, and h3 involves inertia. \n\n#### Findings:\n\n-   Absentee voting appears to be associated with falling turnout.\n\n-   \"Character of election\" causes significant results on turnout to vary.\n\n-   Female empowerment is signficant \n\n-   Average district magnitude, disproportionality, weekend voting, decisiveness of the political system, polarization of party, proportion of the electorate made up of new voters, whether the government of the day was a coalition were not significant. Their role however maybe subsumed by other variables which may explain why they are not significant. \n\n-   Four variables associated with electoral competition have short term effects \n\n    -   Size of the largest party \n\n    -   Margin of victory \n\n    -   Mean margin of victory (for majoritatarian countries) \n\n    -   Party cohesiveness\n\n-   Four variables having to do with instiutiional arrangements have cumulative effects: compulsory voting, female empowerment, young invitations, and executive responsiveness. And size of electorate \n\n-   Time since last election has effects both on new and and on established cohorts \n\n## [Nickerson, David W. 2008. \"Is Voting Contagious?

The purpose of this article is to more appropriately assess the relationship between collective nostalgia and populism by situating collective nostalgia as a psychological factor that contributes to populism. \n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nFollowing the ideational approach, this study claims that populists aim to facilitate the moralistic separation between the pure people (us) and the corrupt elite (them). While constituting the boundaries of us vs. them, populists create an in-group vs. out-group identity. To this end, one of the primary tools that populists utilize is collective nostalgia. Populists offer their constituencies a golden age -- a heartland where corruption, disruptions and enemies do not exist. \n\nElçi situates populism and collective nostalgia in the context of Turkey, where contemporary secularist and Islamic cleavages exist as a product of structures established under the Ottoman Empire. The cleavage exemplifies the ruling center (secularist elites) and the ruled periphery (the Islamic people).  The ruling center adopted Kemalist beliefs - pushing the country to modernize, become secular, and overall promote nationalism. This push was the result of the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990's, leaving a power vacuum in the region that was filled by the Kurds . In response to this, political Islam is aggrandizing the Ottoman past as a tool for the reconstruction of \"**the Great Turkey**\" today. In this way, they are experiencing Ottoman nostalgia - a desire to return to \"the golden days\" and become a leader of the Islamic world.  Ottoman nostalgia is much older than Kemalist nostalgia - which began to emerge in the 1990's following increased pressure by the EU to privatize, as well as increased exposure to the IMF and World bank, which challenged the existing values of the Kemalists. This nostalgia is characterized by 'the memory of a strong, independent, self-sufficient state and its secularist modernization politics which dominated the public sphere through the past century'.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n1.  The more nostalgic respondents are, the more populist attitudes they will express, because nostalgia creates a 'pure people vs. corrupt elites' duality.\n\n2.  Respondents in the nostalgia treatment groups should be more populist than those in the control group in the experimental setting.\n\n3.  The effect of the Ottoman nostalgia treatment on populist attitudes should be greater than the Kemalist nostalgia stimulus in the experimental setting.\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Collective nostalgia has a significantly positive relationship with populist attitudes even after control for various independent variables - such as religiosity, partisanship, satisfaction with life and Euroscepticism\n\n-   Ottoman nostalgia increases populist attitudes\n\n-   Kemalist nostalgia has a weak direct effect on attitude that disappears when party preference is controlled for\n\n### Method:\n\nUses a representative survey (n=1,954) and experimental datasets\n\n-   the  survey tests the link between individuals' predisposition to nostalgia and populist attitudes (H1)\n\n-   DV:Populist beliefs\n\n    -    constructed from four survey items from previous research that Elçi aggregated into an index ranging from 0 (least agreement) to 100 (most agreement)\n\n-   IV: Nostalgia\n\n    -   Constructed from four different survey items that seek to measure the importance of past values, past experiences, old tastes, and the country's glorious past\n\n-   Controls: \n\n    -   Three sets of IVs to control for the relationship between populism and nostalgia\n\n        -   support for EU membership, satisfaction with democracy, economic conditions, and life, and interpersonal trust questions\n\n        -   Alevi, Kurdish and religiosity, where the cross-cutting cleavages in Turkish society occur.\n\n        -   Partisanship, sex, age, education, income, urban residency. \n\n-   Created 10 different models to control for the effect of nostalgia with party preference and satisfaction with life, democracy, and economic conditions.\n\nAlso performed an experimental analysis\n\n-   created a between-group experimental design in which two groups received different types of nostalgic messages\n\n    -   These were Ottoman and Kemalist\n\n    -   Also used a control group that DID NOT receive any stimulus\n\n-   Data was collected using convenience sampling - respondents were recruited through Facebook and Instagram ads using Qualtrics survey tool\n\n-   N = 911 \n\n    -   Were asked a series of warmup questions - such as satisfaction with democracy, lives, and economic conditions \n\n    -   Randomly assigned them to groups\n\n    -   Introduced experimental vignettes \n\n        -   Ottoman and Kemalist groups were presented with a message priming them to respond to texts about history of Turkey\n\n        -   Control group did not receive any message\n\n-   tested the effect of nostalgia treatments on populist attitudes by building a populism index with five items taken from Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove (2014).\n\n-   summed all items and built a scale between 0 and 100, where 100 indicates higher populist attitudes\n\n### Definitions:\n\n-   **Populism**\n\n    -   **(Mudde, 2007) a thin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into to homogenous and antagonistic groups:**\n\n        -   **the pure people versus the corrupt elite**\n\n-   **Collective Nostalgia**\n\n    -   (Wildschut et al. 2014) the nostalgic reverie that is contingent upon thinking of oneself in terms of a particular social identity or as a member of a particular group and concerns events or objects related to it\n\n-   **Cleavages** \n\n    -   (Somer & McCoy, 2019) formative rifts that 'either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime\n\n### General Notes:\n\n-   Turkey's populist Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) exploits nostalgic rhetoric to dominate the country's politics.\n\n    -   emphasize the glorious days of the Ottoman and Seljukian empires\n\n-   Populists frequently emphasize that the elites hijacked the people's will long ago, and they promise to return power to the people. \n\n    -   According to this logic, back in the good old days corrupt elites were not powerful enough to abuse the authentic people.\n\n-   According to populists, the people's will is the cornerstone of politics \n\n-   Many scholars agree that populism appears as a backlash to a sense of severe crisis (Rooduijn 2014; Taggart 2004) or discontent (Spruyt, Keppens and Van Droogenbroeck 2016). \n\n    -   This sense of extreme crisis paves the way for raising concerns about the present conditions, which is a breeding ground for populism (Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove 2014). \n\n    -   Populists blame the establishment for the decline in the people's economic, political and living standards (Rooduijn, van der Brug and de Lange 2017).\n\n-   Populism can also be generated by unsolved, long-lasting and cross-cutting political cleavages within a society. Somer and McCoy (2019, 8) define these cleavages as formative rifts that 'either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime\n\n-   Nostalgia is a yearning for the past \n\n    -   According to Strauth and Turner (1988) it has four component parts\n\n        -   First, 'there is the view of history as decline and loss, being a departure from some golden age of \"homefulness\"'. \n\n        -   Second,  is the problem that there exists 'a sense of the loss of wholeness and moral certainty'. \n\n            -   At this point, 'history is seen to be a collapse of values which had once provided the unity of social relations and personal experience'. \n\n        -   The third is related to 'the loss of individual autonomy and the collapse of genuine social relationships'. \n\n        -   Last but not least, nostalgia is 'the sense of a loss of simplicity, spontaneity, and authenticity'\n\n    -   Nostalgia, or the way we remember our past, **exacerbates in-group vs. out-group distinctions** (Martinovic et al. 2018). \n\n    -   Nostalgia also **strengthens shared social identity and distinguishes the in-group from other groups** (Brown and Humphreys 2002; Wildschut et al. 2014).\n\n-   The rise of populism is closely related to 'acute despair at the present moment and a memory of a previous golden age'.\n\n-   The golden age corresponds to the heartland in populist literature. \n\n    -   Coined by Taggart (2004, 278), 'the heartland is a construction of the good life derived retrospectively from a romanticized conception of life as it has been lived'. \n\n    -   It involves returning to the pre-lapsarian world, a Golden age before a catastrophic lapse or fall: in the post-lapsarian era, individuals feel lacking, deficient or oppressed (Tannock 1995).\n\n-   In Turkey, secularists and Islamist cleavages exist\n\n    -   The secularists can be thought of as the elites and appear to be supported by the left\n\n        -   they have dominated Turkish politics and society as guardians of the Kemalist values\n\n    -    The Islamist's are the people, representing the ruled and appear to be supported by the right (Çarkoğlu 2012; Çarkoğlu and Hinich 2006).\n\n-   Expectations that impacted Control variable selection: \n\n    -   The author expects that the more dissatisfied respondents are with their lives in general, subjective economic conditions and democracy, the more populist attitudes they will have.\n\n    -   Religiosity plays a pivotal role in explaining the party preferences of the Turkish constituency and is a key independent variable for explaining the center--periphery cleavage.\n\n        -   Therefore expects more religious respondents to display more populist attitudes.\n\n    -   Expect Alevi respondents to have less populist attitudes because they are more supportive of secularism.\n\n    -   Expects that Kurdish respondents will have more populist attitudes because they are more critical of the Kemalist establishment.\n\n    -   The Peoples' Democratic Party (Halkların Demokratik Partisi, HDP), as a radical democratic pro-Kurdish party, should also display more populist attitudes\n\n    -   expect CHP and Nationalist Action Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, MHP) voters to have less populist attitudes since they represent the status quo.\n\n## Fitzgerald, Jennifer. 2018.

Why do certain people at certain times in certain places decide that a radical right party or candidate merits their electoral support? \n\n### Focus:\n\nEurope, North American, Oceania \n\n-   Mainly Switzerland and France\n\n### Literature insights: \n\n-   Originally, social group based voting was powerful and pervasive. The left had unions and the right had churches; these were stabilizing forces. \n\n    -   However, as membership in unions and churches and their attendant social groups wanes, support for mainstream left and right parties becomes less socially rooted in a traditional sense and less habitual. \n\n        -   Instead of approaching elections from particular social positions, people now make choices at the polls that are motivated by attitudes on specific policy issues and attraction to particular political leaders. \n\nLocalist Theory of Radical Right Voting: an account of unconventional electoral behavior that is motivated by people's feelings of attachment to their local communities \n\n### Main Argument:\n\n\"I argue that those individuals with the strongest sense of belonging to their localities find the programs of radical right parties particularly appealing.\" \n\n-   All politics is local - Tip O'Neill\n\n-   Local attachments underpin and motivate radical right support\n\n### Localism: \n\n-   Small scale communities can offer a sense of belonging and a sense of place; research in psychology bears this out. \n\n-   Globalization has changed things. \n\n    -   As globalism has increased, the importance of the local has grown in response. \n\n    -   \"Modern life has not erased the importance of place...It may have, instead, increased the need for people to draw boundaries, to more crisply define their geographic community...and to behave in ways that signal their place-related identities...People are often proud of where they are from, and they continue to want you to know it. (Cramer 2016: 240, fn. 12) \n\n    -   Globalization pushes people to invest reflexively in their local areas, it also threatens to undermine what makes each locality special. Pg 6 \n\n-   Eric Hobsbawm: The impersonalizing forces of globalization push people to invent mental connections to social groups, thereby reinforcing the rise of identity politics. \n\n### What is the typical right winger?\n\n-   MAN \n\n-   Low socio-economic status \n\n-   Typically holds negative view of modern developments \n\n    -   Immigration, outsiders ruining \"the way it was\" \n\n        -   Trad dudes. \n\n### Interesting insights: \n\n-   High Social Capital negates the typical right winger. \n\n-   \"Straddling the individual-aggregate divide are accounts informed by theorist of social capital; the argument is that individuals who invest in social capital (through the participation in civil society) and those communities rich in social capital will not find the radical right particularly appealing\" (Coffe et al. 2007) \n\n### **\\*\\*\\*Social Capital v. Localism\\*\\*\\***\n\n-   So like if you have good thoughts about your communities you will vote far right but if you're very involved with community you won't\n\n-   Having very positive sentiment toward the locality and the people in it can make the radical right appealing. \n\n-   In contrast, route engagement in community life wards off the appeals of these parties; when people invest their time and energy into participating in civil society and neighborhood life, the radical right is not so enticing an option. \n\n    -   Moreover it is feelings of attachment not the actual routine social interaction that benefits radical right parties. \n\n-   When people avoid routine social and organizational activity, but still feel very positively tied to their local communities, they are powerfully primed to consider radical right programs alluring. \n\n### Findings: \n\n-   I find that today's passion for all things local and localities' enhanced political salience have contributed to the growth of radical right parties. \n\n-   Radical right does best when locality is politically salient. \n\n-   Local tues are most politically relevant when and where the locality has significant authority and autonomy, when and where the locality has recently lost substantial power, and when and where local elections are temporally proximal to national elections.\n\n## Mudde, Cas, and Christóbol Rovira Kaltwasser. 2013. \"Exclusionary vs. Inclusionary Populism: Comparing Contemporary Europe and Latin America.\" Government and Opposition 48(2): 147-174.\n\n**This is not an empirical paper and it's kind of like a case study (sort of).**\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nSubtypes of populism have regional similarities; Latin American populism is generally inclusive in nature while European populism is generally exclusive.\n\n### Data:\n\nBroad patterns of populism with more focused attention on France, Austria, Bolivia, and Venezuela\n\n### General Notes:\n\n-   Rise in interest in studying populism and its relationship with democracy\n\n    -   One key aspect: is populism exclusive, inclusive, or both?\n\n        -   Findings largely regionally determined; LA inclusive while Europe exclusive\n\n        -   Few cross-regional studies\n\n-   To overcome conceptual confusion and regional isolation, this article investigates whether populism is exclusive or inclusive (or both) cross-regionally and by consistently using one definition of populism\n\n    -   4 case studies 1990-2010: Haider and Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), Le Pen and French National Front (FN), Morales and Bolivian Movement for Socialism (MAS), and Chávez and United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV)\n\n    -   3 dimensions of inclusion/exclusion: material, symbolic, and political\n\n        -   2 factors crucial to understanding regional patterns:\n\n1.

It looks at the effects that macro-level institutions and contexts have on citizen behaviour, along with how political institutions and the environment where citizens form opinions and act, help in moderating the effects of individual-level factors on citizen behaviour. The modelling structures and behaviour, effects of structures on voter behaviour, and the interactions of structures and behaviour in research on economic voting are some of the topics covered in the article.\n\n**Outline:**\n\n-   **Does x cause behaviour y? It depends!**\n\n    1.  **Example: Does institutional performance affect people's sense of whether their political system is legitimate?**\n        -   **Answer: The impact of corruption on system support is conditional on whether citizens are supporters of the incumbent government.**\n    2.  **Studies are getting better at using institutions and context to predict the effects of citizen behaviour.**\n\n-   Comparative study of structures and behaviour = citizens in context \n\n-   Context and behaviour intimately connected by:\n\n    1.  Formal and informal rules; people's preferences, attitudes, and behaviour affect the establishment and functioning of rules\n    2.  Citizens are exposed to variable social, political, and economic environments that they are supposed to understand, interpret, and sometimes shape\n\n-   Advances in surveys, replication, and computing have allowed for cross-national and multi-level research into behaviour\n\n-   1980s and 1990s renewed focus on institutional questions across polysci that could be tested, as well as interest in developing contextual theories of political behaviour\n\n-   Comparative study of behaviour politics has investigated macro-level contexts/structures:\n\n    1.  Institutions\n\n    2.  Structural conditions\n\n-   Interaction between structures and behaviour presumes several things:\n\n    1.  Politics is about the interaction of people's values and the rules and conditions that govern the implementation of those values\n    2.  The rules and realities in which citizens make choices are themselves a function of people's values\n        -   \"Put another way: contexts are critical for understanding the decisions people make because they affect different people differently, and people's decisions, in turn, shape the nature, shape, and stability of these contexts\" (678).\n\n-   Common approach assumes that context shapes behaviour; assumes behaviour to be DV and that it is exogenous and stable\n\n    1.  Do institutions have direct effects on behaviour?\n\n        -   Voting example: structures can affect voters directly, indirectly, and interactively (or contingently)\n            -   Direct: rational choice theory; individuals weigh costs and benefits of voting and act accordingly\n            -   Indirect: behaviours of elites within electoral rules empower or constrain citizen choices; structures have consequences but these consequences have secondary (or indirect) effects on behaviour\n            -   Contingent: effect of some structural feature strengthened or weakened, depending on presence of some 3rd variable; the turnout gap between individuals with many and few resources is particularly pronounced in countries where the cost of voting is high\n\n{INSERT PHOTO HERE}\n\n-   Recent studies have looked at how the nature of a country's representative structures interacts with the willingness of voters to punish governments for bad economic performance\n    1.  Bad economy impact hinges on ability of voters to hold gov't responsible\n    2.  Institutions can hamper this ability of voters to reward or punish gov'ts\n    3.  Clarity of responsibility also varies over time within (and across) countries b/c of election outcomes that change bargaining power and reshape context\n    4.  Also contingent upon credible alternatives for voters to vote into office\n-   Interactions of vote choice and structures in research on legitimacy\n    1.

Arnold A. Rogow, cited p.482).  \n\n### KEY ARGUMENT:\n\nFollowing evidence and psychological research on personality traits of  different society's strata, Lipset posits that the lower strata are predisposed to support  authoritarianism due to a lack of \"sophistication\" and facing economic and psychological  insecurity. The lower class will support economic liberalism but not political liberalism, while the  middle and upper class will support political liberalism. Hence, according to Lipset, there is a  natural link between the lower-class attitudes and their support of Communism. \n\n-Pre-1914: working-class supported both economic and political liberalism \n\n-Post-1914: \"The intransigent, intolerant, and demonological aspects of Communist ideology attract members from the lower class of low-income, low-status occupations, and little education\" (483).\n\n### DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND STRATIFICATION:\n\n• \"Leftism/economic liberalism associated with socio-economic status\" (485). • \"Psychologically oriented investigators have studied the social correlates of authoritarian  personality structures as measured by the now famous F scale\"(Adorno, 1950, cited p.  486). \n\n• Even in conservatism, economic status predicts tolerance levels (see Eysenck, 1956 and  Stouffer, 1955, cited p.486)\n\n### AUTHORITARIAN RELIGION AND STRATIFICATION:\n\n• Fundamentalist and chiliastic/millennial religious tradition as a predisposition for drastic  and rapid measures demanding authoritarian order. \n\n• The appeal of fundamentalism to the lower class acts as a pressure valve in a utopian world  where the upper class no longer dominates. \n\n• See Engels and his take on evangelism (488). \n\n### TYPICAL SOCIAL SITUATION OF LOWER-CLASS PERSON\n\n-   \"There is consistent evidence that degree of formal education, itself closely correlated with  social and economic status, is also highly correlated with undemocratic attitudes\" (489). • Education predicts attitudes better than occupation (Morris Janowitz and Dwaine Marvick study, cited pp.489-490). \n\n-   Principal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  \"sophistication,\" economic security, and psychological security -\\> mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = \"surviving\"  \n\n### THE PERSPECTIVES OF LOWER-CLASS GROUPS\n\n-   Principal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  \"sophistication,\" economic security, and psychological security -\\> mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = \"surviving\"\n\n-   Incapacity of mental abstraction and fixed mental context\n\n### **EXTREMISM AS A COMPLEX ALTERNATIVE: A TEST OF HYPOTHESIS**\n\n-   When the Communist Party is small and weak, it tends to uphold non-economic  liberalism/democratic values because of the **presence of intellectual leadership**. \n\n-   When the Communist Party (or Socialist in some cases) is a mass party, it tends to be more  authoritarian (or less committed to democratic values) because it has **stripped its  intellectual leadership**.\n\n-   Underdeveloped countries/economies exacerbate the problems of the lower class and  increase the predisposition to authoritarianism on a like-for-like basis. \n\n-   This argument is evaluated subnationally and supports the urban/rural predisposition to  uphold democratic values and political liberalism.\n\n**HISTORICAL PATTERNS AND DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS**\n\n-   Historically, the left has been responsible for democratization; intellectual leadership still  supports democratic values, but the masses of the lower strata do not understand the  implications of the left beyond economic value to them. \n\n-   Conservatism is vulnerable in democracy for demographic reasons (500). • Neither conservatism nor the authoritarian predisposition of the lower class should be seen  as a threat to democracy. \n\n-   Educational attainment is an essential \"Social Requisites of Democracy\" (Lipset, 1959). \n\n## [Zuckerman, Alan S. 2005. \"Returning to the Social Logic of Political Behavior.\" Ch.1 in Alan S.

Is focuses on how traditional theories from sociology and psychology informed our understanding of political behaviors through interactions with primary groups. However, along the way, the political science discipline that studied behavior began undergoing changes to the way behavioral study was approached - emphasizing, instead, individual level survey research and a reconceptualization of social logic. Fortunately, social logic is back on the mend. \n\n### Research Question/Purpose: \n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to outline the reasons for which those who study political choice and behavior should return to the social logic of the original behavioral revolution in political science. \n\n### Data/Methods: \n\nThere is no data used. Passages, statements, and long quotations stand in for the data. Draws on authors such as Campbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes, Verba Findings: \n\nWe need to return to our roots an incorporate social logic back into behavioral political science \n\nInterpersonal relationships can both prevent **and** facilitate change \n\nMany scholars broke away from social logic, pursuing instead individual level analysis from surveys and redefining social logic to fit their particular needs Newer research is returning to social logic\n\n### Definitions: \n\n**Social Logic of Politics:**\n\na theory of politics that emphasizes the ways in which social factors (social identities, distribution of power across groups, public opinion) influence individual behaviors and how those interact with institutional structures to effect the political process. \n\n### Discussion Questions: \n\nWhat are the consequences of the social logic of politics for our understanding of those communities/persons with intersectional identities? Is this theory anglo centric, or does it retain its superior qualities across groups? \n\nHow might association through primary groups have an impact of institutions? At what point does the saliency of group association diminish? Do our politics/attitudes change drastically with each primary group we grow closer to, or do those groups we first develop our attitudes through matter most? \n\n### Additional Notes: \n\n### Intro: \n\nThe immediate social circumstances of people's lives influence what they believe and do about politics \n\nImmediate social circles are powerful forces in swaying ones political beliefs and actions \n\nGroup relationships are important for fixing and maintaining opinions in relation to large parts of the political system (such as parties) (Key, 1961) \n\n### Sources in Sociology: \n\nparticularly influential were Lazarsfeld, Katz, Berelson, Gaudet, and McPhee Electoral Sociology was where the onset of the behavioral revolution in political science first observed electoral choice \n\nVoting is a reflection of our behavior - of our conversations with other people and the attitudes we shape through those interactions \n\nBy this logic, we vote based on how the relationships we have shape us This is counter to theories of voting as a rational act \n\n### Sources in Social Psychology \n\nparticularly influential were Kurt Lewin and Leon Festinger \n\nhelped explain conformity\n\nsharing an identity (social class, ethnicity, religion, etc.) does NOT define a social group \n\nopinions, preferences, and beliefs are a joint function of how \"real\" the matter is, the views held by the members of a person's groups, and the persons own conceptions joining a group tends to produce changes in opinions and attitudes toward alignment with the group \n\n### The Turn Away from the Social Logic of Politics \n\n#### Started to examine individuals instead of groups \n\nBegan surveying a lot (members of the same social circles shouldn't be surveyed together \\-- its no longer as-if random, and you introduce bias into your survey responses) \n\nTurned social groups into objects of individual identification \n\nElectoral research shifted towards understanding party identification and perceptions of candidates \n\n#### What factors explain this shift away from the social logic? \n\nOne set derives from decision to use national sample surveys as the exclusive source of empirical evidence of behavior \n\nAnother set derives from theory issues \\-- PoliSci insisted that sociologists couldn't explain electoral decisions or outcomes \\-- opted instead for immediate determinants of vote choice: attitudes and calculations \n\nStatistics professors, rearing political sciences, conveyed cherished assumptions of independent sampling \\-- which makes it nearly impossible to capture the psychology of inter-dependance \n\n#### Recognizing that data problems inhibited their ability to follow theoretical preferences \n\nCampbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes altered the definition of the social group and conceptualized it according to a personal perceptions regarding a reference object - taking it far away from its original intent/definition from Lewis Many others would make even larger breaks, such as Key and Downs (immediate circle provides no more than time-saving sources of information to calculating citizens) \n\n### Returning (Again) to the Social Logic of Politics \n\nWe returned! \n\nMichigan survey responses can be used to study the role of immediate social structures on political choice and behavior \n\nTon of other research is starting to do the same thing\n\n# Week 3: Political Beliefs/Political Decision-Making\n\n## [Converse, Philip E. 2006 \\[1964\\]. \"The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics.\" Critical  Review: A Journal of Politics and Society 18(1): 1-74](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16M558a3a-7_AQdWXhfvuM6Swc4BvqhbY/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Normative question: \n\n**Does the citizenry have the \"capacity\" to participate in democracy**? Concern the age-old  question of the demos' potential to access information and process it in a way that would be  individually coherent in election expressions. Converse's (1964) \"The Nature of Belief Systems  in Mass Publics\" marks a turning point since **it can quantitatively/statistically demonstrate**\n\ndemocracy defenders' worst fears: the mass public competence for a normative functioning of  democracy is blight. This question has also been approached with similar results by Lipmann (1922), \"Public Opinion\" and Schumpeter (1950), \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\" (see  also Bennett, 2006, \"Democratic Competence, Before Converse and After\"). \n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nMass Public: Ideologically Innocent  \n\n### DV:\n\nDegree of Belief System Coherence (Individual) (a continuum)\n\n### IV:\n\nLevel of Constrained Idea-Elements (a continuum)\n\n### Data:\n\nConverse stipulates that the degree of coherence of the mass public belief system is contingent on the level of constraints of the idea-elements populating a belief system: the more constrained, the  more coherent. This, in turn, predicts a degree of capacity to participate in democracy according  to one's self-assessed ideological placement. Idea-elements are mainly constrained by the  transmission of information and its digestibility. For this reason, Converse finds that 15% of the  population is deemed ideologue or near-ideologue (possessing a coherent belief system = elite political actors). In contrast, the remaining 85% (the masses) float between having a particular  interest (issue public) or having no idea. **If ideology is not driving most of the public's opinion  incentive, what is?** Converse suggests that \"visible\" social groupings serve as a stable heuristic  informing public opinion: party ID (.70) has more bearing than policies, but policies concerning  visible groups (school desegregation .45) have more bearing than regular policies (government and housing .28). This \"ideology by proxy\" might produce idiosyncratic outcomes as well: the  working man associating with Socialists against the rich but against government reigning of private  enterprise's provision of public goods. \n\n\\\nPICTURE HERE\n\nAcquiring and processing information is contingent on **education**.

The article serves as an overview of the topic. It begins by locating the network research within the rich substantive and theoretical tradition of individually and #group-based studies of #electoral #politics and #public #opinion . It addresses some methodological issues in the study of political information #networks. The article ends with the discussion of theoretical and substantive insights that were generated in several studies, such as the study of communication and persuasion among citizens.\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhat is network analysis? What are the theoretical and substantive insights that we can derive from it, particularly regarding the study of communication and persuasion among citizens? What are some of the methodological issues of network analysis?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nThe author sets out to analyze the contribution of network theories, which have provided us the ability to analyze citizen and democratic politics from across the micro-macro spectrum. Network theories draw on the importance of groups, communities, and political information networks among and between individuals (Downs 1957) while incorporating a conceptual apparatus that extends far past the traditional notions of primary groups, organizations, and societal groups in order to define the relationships that exist among individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Despite its advantages, there are still some methodological issues with network analysis.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\nIt is a literature review so no real data/methods.\n\n### Findings:\n\n#### What is network analysis and how does it fit into the existing literature on the study of individuals and groups?\n\n-   Network studies can be seen as a particular species within a larger genus---as one type of a contextual analysis of politics (Knoke 1990)\n-   networks are formed at the complex intersection between individual preference, individual engagement, and individual location within particular contexts.\n-   Eulau (1986) and Przeworski and Teune (1970) define contextual factors in terms of the aggregation of individual characteristics that affect individuals through processes of social interaction.\n    -   Network Studies diverge from contextual studies in their effort to incorporate a direct mapping for the particular patterns of recurrent interaction among actors.\n-   Individual level and aggregate level analysis both suffer from the same problem: they ignore the implications that arise due to patterns of individual interdependence located in time, place, and setting.\n\n#### What are some of the methodological issues of the study of political information networks?\n\n-   Absent direct measures on patterns of communication, neither the individual measures nor their associated aggregate versions directly address the specifics of communication and persuasion among the individuals who make up the aggregates.\n\n-   Network studies are particularly useful in analyzing well defined populations - such as clergies, political elites, court, and legislatures.\n\n    -   an unfortunate limitation of egocentric networks is the failure to embed dyads within larger networks and in the context of all other dyads in that same network.\n\n    -   However, they aren't straightforward when analyzing large populations - which is the primary object of study for scholars concerned with studies of mass behavior (egocentric network survey questions and snowball surveys can help address this; pg. 5-6)\n\n-   Political communication networks are created at the intersection of individual choice (demand) and environmental supply (which is stochastic).\n\n#### What are the substantive and theoretical insights generated by it?\n\n-   People are more inclined to discuss politics with others who share similar political beliefs\n\n-   Studies ALSO demonstrate that patterns of both agreement and disagreement can be profitably understood within complex processes of communication and persuasion\n\n    -   This means that there is persistent heterogeneity of opinions in less-dense (larger) social networks people aren't as afraid of disagreement as we initially thought\n\n-   Political heterogeneity in the form of cross cutting cleavages can depress political participation BUT increased levels of tolerance (which might be good?)\n\n-   Political communication networks are more important in less developed democracy, where parties are less institutionalize and politics is more volatile\n\n-   Diversity of group discussion decreases the susceptibility of individuals to issue framing by elites\n\n-   Network studies of political communication and persuasion provide a theoretical, analytical response to the human limitations of the citizen in democratic politics.\n\n    -   this is important because it to do with the cognitive limitations of individuals in being self-contained, fully informed, independent maximizers\n\n    -   particularly useful is social capital - which allows people to rely on one another for accurate information\n\n-   political interdependence among citizens helps to explain why public opinion in the aggregate is more sophisticated than the opinions held by the average citizen - its more fully informed\n\n-   solutions to collective action problems can be seen as occurring within networks of relationships among strategic actors who use the information they acquire through repeated interactions to facilitate group efforts\n\n## [Marcus, George, Pavlos Vasilopoulos, and Martial Foucault. 2018. \"Emotional Responses to the Charlie Hebdo Attacks: Addressing the Authoritarianism Puzzle.\" Political Psychology 39(3): 557-575.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n-r7st8o6H0JMLyYxjWaECPMj-PiiCJN/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nThreat + conservative *OR* liberal ideology = increased authoritarian preference\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe literature shows an interaction between threat and public preference for authoritarianism. There are two lines of literature that provide contradictory findings:\n\n-   One argues that threat increases authoritarian preferences among those that are more prone to authoritarianism\n\n-   Another argues that threat is associated with a switch in ideology among those who are normally non-authoritarian Using a two-wave panel study of the French population taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris, the authors find that the two occur simultaneously.\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhat best explains the relationship between individual perceptions of threat and increased preferences for authoritarian policy?\n\nIs the increase in support for authoritarian policies following a terrorist attack the result of:\n\n1.  conservative and authoritarian prone individuals just more strongly manifesting their disposition in response to threat\n\n2.  **OR** increases in ideological \"switching\" to support authoritarian policies in light of threatening events?\n\n### Theory/Argument:\n\nThe authors argue that the endorsement of authoritarian policies can be explained by the theory of affective intelligence. When people experience anxiety due to novel circumstances, such as that induced by terrorist attacks, they will abandon their habitual political attachments and attend to the circumstance in a risk-averse and conservative manner.\n\n-   **H1:** increased anger will enhance decision making based on past dispositional convictions, leading to increased polarization between left and right wing individuals (strengthen authoritarian tendencies for right-wing and weaken those same tendencies for the right)\n\n-   **H2:** increased anxiety will initiate decision-making that is less reliant on extant convictions and hence make those on the left end of the left-right scale more attentive and responsive to calls from the right to adopt authoritarian policies.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n-   Two-wave panel taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris\n\n-   Data retrieved from the CEVIPOF barometer of political confidence\n\n    -   survey was conducted using a representative sample containing 1,524 respondents in two waves\n\n-   Construct two OLS models\n\n    -   one measures attitude change as a function of demographic variables, ideology, as well as anxiety and anger\n\n    -   second model includes two interaction terms that assess fear and anger with the left-right scale respectively with the expectation that the effect of fear and anger on authoritarian policies with be conditional on prior ideological conviction\n\nModel 1:\n\n$$\nAttiude_{t2}=fear_{t2}+anger_{t2}+left/right\\: scale_{t1}+attitude_{t1}+demographics_{t1}\n$$\n\nModel 2:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}Attitude_{t2} &= fear_{t2} + anger_{t2} + left/right\\: scale_{t1} \\\\&+ fear_{t2} * left/right\\: scale_1 + anger_{t2} * left/right\\: scale + attitude_{t1} + demographics_{t1}\\end{align}\n$$\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\n-   support for authoritarian policies\n\n-   a scale consisting of all available items in the study that measure adoption or rejection of authoritarian politic preferences\n\n    -   each item (survey question) was measured using 4-point response option (higher values = support for authoritarian policies)\n\n    -   only one factor possessed an eigenvalue over 1\n\n### Independent Variable:\n\n-   emotional reaction to the terrorist attacks\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Threat increases authoritarian preferences among those who are more prone to authoritarianism AND those with non-authoritarian ideology\n\n-   Overall, people who felt fear following the attack were more likely to have switched their opinion in an authoritarian direction\n\n-   Left-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful after the attack were more likely to change in the direction of endorsing authoritarian policies\n\n-   Right-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful did not experience a change in direction of endorsing authoritarian policies\n\n-   Right-wing citizens who gelt predominantly angry following the attack experienced heightened endorsement of authoritarianism\n\n-   Left-wing citizen on the far-left who felt predominantly angry were the least likely to support authoritarian politics following the attacks (see figure 3) but is not statistically significant\n\n-   **H2** is supported by the first OLS model\n\n-   **H1** is not supported UNTIL the conditional model\n\n### Importance/Contribution:\n\n-   contributes to our understanding of individual level variation in the endorsement of authoritarian policies as well as our understanding of attitudinal polarization (why fear might reduce polarization across a public)\n\n-   important because the psychological mechanisms that account for the public's reaction to terrorist attacks is key to understanding enhanced support for the restriction of civil liberties\n\n-   also advances and systematizes the literature of emotions and politics by assessing the impact of anxiety and anger on the formation of political attitudes\n\n-   takes advantage of REAL threat perceptions, instead of experimentally manipulated ones\n\n-   has external validity (uses a representative sample of the French population)\n\n-   challenges conventional wisdom that emotions are irrational, turbulent states that hinder reasoning - affect activates political reasoning\n\n### Definitions/Concepts:\n\n#### Theories of Affective Intelligence\n\n-   provides a framework for understanding the interplay of fear and anger with ideological convictions\n\n-   with respect to anxiety, the theory holds that when citizens find themselves in novel circumstances, they tend to break from habitual political attachments (ideology/partisanship) and actively try to attend to contemporary circumstances about their environment.\n\n-   with respect to anger, the theory holds that it may trigger authoritarian policy preferences through the activation of habitually learned routines, activating conservative or authoritarian attitudes among individuals who already hold a right-wing disposition.\n\n    -   it is not the potency of threat the increases anger, but rather the degree of normative violation\n\n#### Terror Management Theory (TMT)\n\n-   people feel threatened by their own death and therefore adopt worldviews that allow them to find meaning and worth in their lives.\n\n    -   awareness of ones death can cause anxiety\n\n    -   is used to explain that mortality-related threat reinforces extant political beliefs regardless of whether these are liberal or conservative.\n\n    -   political ideology serves as a protective shield against death anxiety.\n\n#### Left-Right Ideological Identification\n\n-   defined by the authors as the an organized cluster of political values that make some individuals more inclined to support some political ideas than others.\n\n#### Threat\n\n-   defined by the authors as an exogenous event that poses harmful consequences for the individual or her environment and evokes negative emotional reactions.\n\n#### Anxiety\n\n-   elevated in threatening circumstances and is one of the prime emotional reactions to a terrorist event when heightened, conveys a perception of increased risk and prompts individuals to adopt risk-averse behavior to eliminate or avert the threat\n\n#### Anger\n\n-   generated when people are obstructed from reaching a valued goal by an external agent whose conduct is deemed unfair and in cases when a threatening stimulus is perceived\n\n#### Threat Stimulus\n\n-   Assessed on two distinct grounds:\n\n    -   is the event novel? (+anxiety)\n\n    -   is the event a normative violation by a familiar enemy (+anger)\n\n## [Schwartz, Shalom H., et al. 2014. \"Basic Personal Values Underlie and Give Coherence to Political Values: A Cross-National Study in 15 Countries.\" Political Behavior 36(4): 899-930.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12XuNANtbUQaoiO-kzaazkdD6Gkxc7CVu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nPersonal values explain political values!\n\n### Independent Variable:\n\nBasic Personal Values\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\nPolitical Values\n\nResearch question: Do political attitudes and values of the general public form a coherent system?

This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being \"motivated- skepticals\" when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e. spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of \"partisan processing\" that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:\n\n**H1:** there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs\n\n**H2:** there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments\n\n**H3:** there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones\n\n**These combined will results in:**\n\n**H4:** attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments\n\n**Which is conditional upon:**\n\n**H5:** the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism\n\n**H6:** and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n-   Two experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control\n\n-   The participants (Ps) were recruited from introductory political science courses at Stony Brook University\n\n-   Study 1: N=126\n\n-   Study 2: N=136\n\n-   **First Part:** Confirmation Bias\n\n-   The participants (Ps) were seated at computers and their political attitudes were assessed through the evaluation of a series of contemporary political issues aimed at activating their priors - this was done through random assignment into either condition 1 or condition 2 (see figure 1)\n\n-   They rated the items on a series of scales to assess attitude strength (0-100) and attitude position (like-dislike; 9 item scale)\n\n-   They then viewed information on an information board, where they could seek out hidden policy arguments by known source alone (see figure 2); the amount of time they spend engaging in each argument was recorded by the software.\n\n-   They viewed eight arguments without a time limit, but could only view each argument ONCE\n\n-   They then completed the same attitude battery from the beginning of the experiment before filing out demographic information and a political knowledge scale ( to assess sophistication)\n\n-   **Second Part:** Disconfirmation Bias\n\n-   administered the battery again, but with the conditions (issues) swapped.\n\n-   then asked to rank the strength of 8 arguments (4 pro and 4 con)\n\n-   then there was a post test battery AGAIN and a recognition memory test\n\n-   they were also asked to list their thoughts regarding two pro and two con arguments they were presented with Arguments were taken from online sources and edited such that they were similar in complexity and length.\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   strong evidence of a prior attitude effect (H1) such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments.\n\n-   Participants counter-argued the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias (H2) - this was supported by the participants spending MORE time on the policy arguments that they disagreed with\n\n-   Also find a confirmation bias (H3)---the seeking out of confirmatory evidence---when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read - this was supported by the participants seeking out information in the matrix that they agreed with\n\n-   Both the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization (H4) ---the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes---especially among those with the strongest priors (H5) and highest levels of political sophistication (H6).\n\n# Week 4: Partisanship/Party Preference\n\n## [Achen, Christopher. 2002. \"Parental Socialization and Rational Party ID.\" Political Behavior 24(2): 151-170.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eDBfh3YzHzQ0ovR5SRV04ve3n0VbGqFr/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Abstract:\n\n### Bumper Sticker\n\n### Model\n\n## [Bankert, Alexa, Leonie Huddy, and Martin Rosema. 2017. \"Measuring Partisanship as a Social Identity in Multi-Party Systems.\" Political Behavior 39(1): 103-132.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KakFRmU4PuCmQS4ckJQ0FFGTKOzxswJe/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\n\"multi-item scales of partisanship can work in and across multi-party systems\"\n\n### Research Question:\n\nHow (if at all) can we create a multi-item scale that measures partisanship across multi-party systems?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nMost national election studies tend to rely on a single measure of partisanship. Such measurements tend to vary in terms of how they are phrased on surveys and also struggle to capture the range of partisan identity, typically at the low and high ends of the spectrum. The authors believe that they can develop a multi-item scale of partisan identity that better predicts political behavior ACROSS various multiparty democracies than the traditional single item scales common on surveys. \n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n#### Partisan Identity Scale\n\nCreates an Eight-Item Scale of Partisanship that is derived from Social Identity Theory Derives three (3) hypothesis to test whether the scale is better than traditional models: **H1**: The Partisan Identity Scale should differentiate equally well among low, middling, and high levels of identity to best uncover the link between identity and political activity across its full range. Expect each scale item to provide more complete information about partisan strength than the traditional single party identification item. \n\nIn terms of the IRT analysis, this means that each item's information function will be more peaked and contain greater information than the standard single measure of partisan strength. In the three European multi-party systems under study, we expect both lower and higher levels of partisan intensity to remain less well detected when measured with the traditional item\n\n**H2:** the partisan identity scale to exhibit all three types of invariance, which means that the fit of the metric invariance model will be no worse than the fit of the configural model, and that the fit of the scalar model will be no worse than that of the metric model. \n\n**H3:** The partisan identity scale should more powerfully predict in-party voting and political engagement than the traditional party identification item. We also expect the partisan identity scale to better predict political behavior than a multi-item indicator of ideological intensity \n\n### Data:\n\nUses Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K. as the three countries with which to derive and apply the scale.\n\n#### Netherlands:\n\n2012 Dutch Parliamentary elections among members of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The LISS contains 5000 households, entailing 8000 individuals Data are drawn from three time points: August 2012 (''Elections 2012''), after the national election in September 2012 (''Dutch Parliamentary Election Study''), and again as part of a module in December 2012/January 2013 (''Politics and Values: Wave 6'').\n\n#### Sweden:\n\nSwedish data were drawn from the Swedish Citizen Panel, a largely opt-in online panel run by the Laboratory of Opinion Research (LORE) at the University of Gothenburg. \n\nUtilize data from Panel 8 (11/14/13--12/18/13) and add-on Panel 8-2 (12/10/13--1/7/14). 16,130 panelists were invited to take the Panel 8 survey and 9279 completed it for a completion rate of 64 %. \n\n2000 panelists were invited to complete Panel 8-2 of which 1496 answered the survey. All panelists in Panel 8.2 and a randomly selected 2000 panelists in Citizen Panel 8 received the identity model. \n\nOur analytic sample is confined to those in Panel 8 and Panel 8-2 who completed the identity items (N = 2464). \n\n#### UK:\n\nData for the U.K were taken from the 2015 British Election Study (BES), an online panel study conducted by YouGov. \n\ndraw on data from pre-election wave 3 of the BES, conducted between September 19, 2014 and October 17, 2014 and pre- election wave 4, conducted in March 2015. \n\nIn total, 27,839 respondents participated in wave 3 and 6141 were randomly assigned and 5954 completed a module that included the partisan identity items. \n\nIn wave 4, 16,629 respondents participated and 3500 of them completed the partisan identity module.\n\n### Measures:\n\nPartisanship Strength by Country vs. Partisan Identity Strength (the 8 Item Scale that is also known as the Partisan Identity Scale) \n\n### Methods:\n\nthe methods are pretty complex, but essentially each hypothesis undergoes a different set of tests/inquiry. \\\n**H1** - figure 1 shows how the 8 item scale that the authors derived is better measure of latent partisan strength than the individual measures in each country. This is also event in the peaks that you can see in each figure. They are more much more sensitive to to the full range of the low- high spectrum. **H2** - invariance is measured using R software to perform multi-group confirmatory analysis (CFA) Configural invariance is a good fit \n\nThe partisan scale has the same metric across countries \n\nIts also scalar across countries \n\n**H3** - analyse the determinants of in-party voting using a logistic regression model \n\nPartisan identity strength has a sizeable influence on in-party voting and its effects exceed that of partisanship strength. \n\nPartisan identity predicted in- party vote and participation while holding partisan strength constant\n\n### Findings:\n\nLevels of partisanship have decreased in Europe in recent decades. \n\nThe eight-item partisan identification scale: \n\n-   provides greater information about partisan intensity than the standard single-item\n\n-   possess the same measurement across all three countries \n\n-   better predicts in-party voting and political participation than ideological intensity measures\n\n## [Campbell, Angus, Philip E.

To the authors, the reason for this has to do with the \"hierarchy of values\". When people have obvious values that rank higher than others (humanitarianism, egalitarianism, equality) AND these #values align with political elites values, then partisan identity remains a steady tool with which to measure the political world against. HOWEVER, for some people, the values rank similarly and therefore cause conflicting #preferences that individuals struggle to resolve. Competing values will produce #volatility in partisan opinions specifically when individuals endorse values that cross the fault lines of partisan dialogue \n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n**Data:** ANES data from 1992, 1994, and 1996\n\n**Model:** Estimates several heteroskedastic regression models as well as ordered probit models The heteroskedastic regression models are used because they expect differences in the response variance of party identification survey items to reflect value-conflict \n\nthis is because citizens with ideologically inconsistent value structures will struggle to identify with one party or another \n\nthere should be unequal variance across observations (which is heteroskedastic) \n\nthis heteroskedasticity is modeled to see if those who experience value conflict reveal less predictable responses to party identification survey items than those who do \n\n### Independent Variable:\n\nValue conflict \n\nis measured using **4 core values** in American Politics: \n\nEgalitarianism, limited government, moral traditionalism, and humanitarianism \n\nThe measures for these values are derived from a set of ANES survey questions on each value\n\n1992 and 1996 are the years they were taken from (1992 is missing humanitarianism)\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\nPartisan Instability \n\nTwo \"manifestations\" \n\n-   predictability of survey response (those experience value conflict should have less predictable responses to partisan questions) to two survey questions: \n\n    -   seven-point party identification scale and ideological self identification scale \n\n-   change in party identification over time (this one is tested using the 1994 and 1996 panel data) \n\n### Findings:\n\n1992 and 1996 elections reveal value-driven volatility in partisan identification \n\n-   Instabilities in political views reflect either: \n\n    -   low information (for some) \n\n    -   trade-offs of the political world that cause conflict of values \n\nValue conflict will disrupt partisan stability when an individuals value organization is non-ideological - i.e. it doesn't quite fit the rhetoric or portrayal by the liberal vs. conservative, left-right spectrum. what makes it non-ideological is that you support values on BOTH sides \n\nThose that have values the match political elites leads to stable partisanship \n\nThose that have internalized value organization that doesn't match elites leads to conflicts of values and partisan volatility. \n\nElites identify and interpret core values to justify their policy positions \n\nValues and ideology are traditionally distinct concepts - but values can be distributed along an ideological spectrum\n\n## [Hatemi, Peter K., et al. 2008. \"Is there a 'Party' in Your Genes?\" Political Research Quarterly 62(3): 584-600.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PxIstrhEiXpHenANgaUkdI35PalEo5Mg/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nGenes don't choose party, but they influence intensity!\n\n### **Independent Variable:**\n\nTwins!

One of those contextual effects is the neighborhood effect, whereby individuals are influenced by the nature of the politically relevant information circulating within their social networks, many of which are spatiallyconstrained to their local area. Although ecological analyses have identified patterns consistent with this hypothesis, there have been virtually no direct investigations of the effect, largely because of the absence of relevant data. Using information from a large, clustered survey of voters at the time of the 1992 general election, this paper uncovers clear evidence of such effects: people are much more likely to change their votes in a particular direction if those with whom they discuss political issues support that direction, especially if they are members of the respondent's family and are the individuals with whom they discuss politics most.\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nWho we talk to is as important as who we are and who we talk to is very much influenced by where we live --- we are what we are, and do what we do, because of where we are, and have been **OR** those who talk together tend to vote together.\n\n### Research Question:\n\nDoes the neighborhood effect have an impact on voter decisions?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nMost researchers have accepted that voters are influence by their immediate social and geographical environments as well as their own individual circumstances. However, the way in which such contextual factors operate is contested. Most explanations point to spatial variation in economic and political contexts and the driving force behind voter's decisions. That is, \"nonsocial\" context on economic and political conditions at the local and national level compose the voting repertoire with which individuals draw on at the polls.\n\nHowever, the authors speculate that the influence of immediate social networks (family, friends, colleagues) on individual opinions informs their voting behavior. Early research explored such possibilities, but scarcity of data left this \"neighborhood effect\" to be abandoned if favor of explanations that could be explored.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nMain hypothesis: Each group would be influenced by the dominant nature of electorally relevant information in their social networks---those who changed the party that they supported should be in networks where support for their new party is strong, whereas those who remained loyal to a party should be in networks that give it strong support.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n-   Explores contextual effects on voting behavior in Great Britain\n\n-   Uses data collected in the British Election Study (BES) from the 1992 British General Election, which lends itself to the data requirement of networks of people living in the same locality.\n\n    -   The data uses a cluster rather than a random sample: 210 \"points\" (which are polling districts made up of 1,000-2,000 voters).\n\n    -   Used a stratified random design with a random sample of respondents selected from the electoral roll for the district\n\n    -   Produces 2,526 individuals with an average sample size of around 16 per cluster, with a peaked distribution between 16 and 19\n\n-   Authors chose to focus on why some respondents, from their own recollection, changed their vote between 1987 and 1992 while others did not\n\n-   By aggregating the reported 1987 votes of each BES respondent by polling district, the authors were able to estimate the vote share there for each of the three main political parties that fought in all British constituencies in both 1987 and 1992: Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat (Alliance in 1987).\n\n-   **First analysis:**\n\n    -   Contrasts those who switched their vote to a particular party in 1992 (coded 1) against those who didn't (coded 0)\n\n    -   Gives 3 dependent variables:\n\n        -   1\\. switch to conservative 2) switch to labor 3) switch to Liberal\n\n    -   Employs a Logistic Regression (because the DVs are binary)\n\n    -   Then does the same thing but looks at those who defected (voted for each party in 1987) So those who voted for a particular party in 1987 and again in 1992 (the loyalists) against those that voted for another party/ didn't vote at all in 1992 (the defectors)\n\n-   **Second analysis:**\n\n    -   looks at the impact of conversations with the individuals respondents named as the first (primary) discussant of politics and analyzing how that affected transitions to each party\n\n    -   Measures those who who didn't vote for the same party in 1992 as they did in 1987 against those who did\n\n    -   Also looks at those who defected versus those who didn't\n\n-   **Third analysis:**\n\n    -   Assesses the degree to which cross cutting relationships impact vote choice by bringing in two additional discussants that the respondents listed\n\n    -   The more discussants who support a particular party, the greater the expected probability that an individual will switch to that party, and the less the probability that he or she will defect from it.\n\n-   **Fourth analysis:**\n\n    -   It's possible that discussants don't live in the same neighborhood (i.e. context) as the respondent. Therefore, there a chance that political context and conversations on voting linked, or could they be separate?\n\n    -   hypothesize that the more support a party has in a locality (the independent variables employed in the regressions reported in Tables 3 and 4), the greater the probability that individuals there will encounter, talk to, and be converted by that party's partisans\n\n    -   tested by dividing the respondents according to how many discussants they report having a particular partisanship, which can vary from 0 to 3.\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Social networks are indeed important influences on voting decisions\n\n    -   Families who talk together, vote together! (kinda) - voters were more likely to vote/not vote for a party based on conversations they had with their families\n\n    -   More accurately: those who talked together tended to vote together.\n\n    -   Conversations with friends are also important\n\n-   **First analysis:**\n\n    -   the more their local area was dominated by supporters of a particular party, the greater the probability that individuals switched their support to that party between 1987 and 1992---if they had not voted for it at the first of those two election\n\n    -   local context did not influence voters' decisions to abandon a party they have previously supported, but that the choice of which party to switch their support to was influenced by local conditions---which is the hypothesized mechanism that underlies the neighborhood effect.\n\n-   **Second analysis:**\n\n    -   Those who did not voter conservative in 1987 were more likely to vote conservative in 1992 if their primary discussant was conservative\n\n        -   talking to Labour or Liberal party discussants made not conservative voters less likely to vote conservative (duh)\n\n    -   Same results hold for other parties - voters were more likely to vote for a particular party if the primary discussant was a member of that party\n\n    -   Frequency of conversation about politics appeared to have no influence\n\n    -   those people who voted for a party in 1987 were less likely to vote for another party in 1992 if their primary discussant had been a supporter of the same parter when compared to their discussant being from another party or having no discussant at all\n\n-   **Third analysis:**\n\n    -   More likely to support and less likely to defect if the discussants were from the same party\n\n-   **Fourth Analysis:**\n\n    -   If a respondent had more discussants from a particular party, then there was also an associated increase in the number of votes for that party in the respondents district\n\n    -   This shows that there is a link between spatial and communicative contexts, supporting the neighboring effects.\n\n-   It is not logical to ignore social networks, and conversations within them, as a possible influence on the voting decision of individuals\n\n### Non-Findings:\n\n-   Can't distinguish if the influential conversations are locally based\n\n-   They know that the conversations matter, but they have no information on the relative locations of the individuals involved in those conversations (how immediate are they?).\n\n-   Also don't know what the content of the conversations were\n\n## [NEED TO ADD WESTHOLM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5n2GZVIRKNrlYdQorMoC6b32G9O5rRw/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# Week 6: Vote Choice - Economic Motivations\n\n## [Bratten, Michael, and Robert Mattes. 2001. \"Support for Democracy in Africa: Intrinsic or Instrumental?\" British Journal of Political Science 31(3): 447-474.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B1mhlUPwh5ERbY-Ql4b2MICIKMQBeIl1/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nAfrican democracy persists b/c of economic AND political change.\n\n### Independent Variable:\n\neconomic, political, and general performance factors on democratic regime\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\nattitudes about democracy\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhy do Africans support democracy?\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n-   Explanatory factors: why variation in support for/satisfaction with democracy?\n\n    -   Social characteristics of population such as literacy, income and gender\n\n    -   Economic goods: popular perceptions of national economic conditions, personal quality of life, and access to materials and services shape feelings about democracy\n\n    -   Political goods: Is the delivery of civil rights and political equality enough?\n\n    -   General performance factors: citizens' overall assessment of governmental performance for 3 reasons:\n\n### Data:\n\n-   3 separate surveys on political attitudes in Ghana, Zambia, and South Africa\n\n    -   Zambia: 1,182 respondents following \"dubious\" 1996 election\n\n    -   South Africa: 3,500 stratified by race, province, community size in 1997 following free & fair elections\n\n    -   Ghana: 2,005 respondents in 1999 following free & fair 1996 elections\n\n        -   All 3 surveys included questions on citizen understanding of the meaning of democracy, support for, and satisfaction with democracy in theory and n practice\n\n### Methods:\n\nMultiple regression in OLS\n\n### Findings:\n\nPopular support for democracy in African countries similar to other Third Wave countries\n\n-   Lower levels of mass satisfaction w/regime performance in African countries\n\n-   General public in African countries thinks instrumentally: support for democracy hinges critically upon popular approval of government achievements\n\n-   Outside of South Africa, many Africans value political goods\n\n**Additional findings:**\n\n1.

It argues that thanks to years of economic adversity, Latin Americans have developed long, sophisticated #economic-memories . Although this has resulted in rising frustration with democratic government, according to recent opinion polls, it has not always led voters to #punish all parties responsible for hardship at election time. A panel study of the region's presidential systems demonstrates that citizens punish incumbents by voting for established #nonincumbents when electoral laws reduce opportunities available to small parties in the systems, even if #nonincumbents have also been blamed for hard economic times. More #permissive-electoral-systems , in contrast, encourage citizens to reject all parties responsible for economic decline. The analysis demonstrates how economic and electoral concerns interact to affect voting behavior, #political-accountability , and #public-opinion in Latin America.\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nEconomic Evaluations Voter Laws Voter Behavior\n\n### Research Question:\n\nIf most Latin Americans have faced economic hardship during successive governments, why do they reject both the incumbent and non-incumbent parties in some systems and only the incumbent party in others?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nMany Latin American economies have experienced some form poor performance that has resulted in different forms of electoral punishment. Barton, drawing on previous literature regarding economic theories of voter behavior, devises a theory that enables her to assess the institutional features that interact with economic performance to determine who voters choose to punish in subsequent elections. In highly permissible systems, where there are more parties to choose from, voters memories of economic performance can interact with electoral strategies to allow the punishment of multiple parties (as has been the case in multiple countries). However, more restrictive systems, which limit the number of viable parties, forces voters to focus their punishing efforts on the incumbent alone, as they require an alternative option of some form and therefore increases support for the form incumbent.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\n-   panel data from 13 Latin American Countries\n\n    -   required (a) to be a presidential system and have had (b) more than one party win the presidency, so that current and former incumbents compete; (c) to have elections deemed free of fraud by international observers, so that their results reflect voters' reactions to party performance; and (d) to have an economic crisis and/or economic reform during democratic rule.\n\n    -   in these countries, 64 elections were held, with 39 instances in which current and former incumbents competed for power\n\n### Independent Variable:\n\neconomic performance as measured by the percentage change in GDP per capita during each parties last 2 years in office.\n\n### Dependent Variable:\n\n-   Change in support for incumbents - measured as the difference between votes received by an incumbent party in presidential elections while in office and votes received in the previous election when the party won.\n\n-   Change in support for non-incumbents out of power - measured as change in support received in elections after leaving office and support when the party originally came into power.\n\n### Model:\n\n-   Uses OLS with #panel-corrected standard errors #PCSEs , which were selected because of the limited number of countries and small (often unbalanced) number of observations in each panel.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n-   **H1:** When incumbent parties are blamed for poor economic performance, they will lose support, regardless of the electoral system used to elect them.\n\n-   **H2:** Nonincumbent parties previously in power will derive greater electoral benefits in restrictive, compared with permissive, electoral contexts when incumbent parties are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.\n\n-   **H3:** Former incumbents blamed for economic decline will continue to receive lower levels of support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts, all else being equal.\n\n-   **H4:** Current incumbents will gain support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts when former incumbents are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.\n\n### Findings:\n\n| Hypothesis | Support | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| H1         | Yes     | incumbent parties' support decreases with economic downturns, without regard to institutional change (p.430)                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| H2         | Yes     | when electoral laws construct institutional barriers to small parties (restrictive), groups once holding the presidency will suffer losses in support when incumbents manage economic growth; as GDP declines, parties previously in power begin to experience a surge of supprot (p.431)   |\n| H3         | Yes     | accounting for the presence of Honduras, there was no relationship between poor economic performance and punishment of former incumbents in restrictive systems; there was a relationship between poor economic performance and the punishment of incumbents in permissive systems (pg.436) |\n| H4         | Yes     | nonincumbents' performance has implications for incumbents' support. As predicted, incumbents gain about 10% of the national votes when nonincumbents are responsible for neoliberal economic reform in all electoral settings                                                              |\n\n### Other Findings:\n\n-   Restrictive institutions reduce the incentive for voters to waste support on parties unlikely to win.\n\n-   Rather than helping nonincumbents weather the electoral effect of incumbents' economic growth, runoffs cause nonincumbents to suffer additional electoral losses.\n\n## Lewis-Beck, Michael S., and Mary Stegmaier. 2009. \"Economic Models of Voting.\" OHPB. Ch. 27: 518-537.\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nThe state of the economy can help predict voter decisions.\n\n### Purpose:\n\nThis is a literature review on micro-level, survey research studies of economic voting in the U.S., Britain, France, and Globally.\n\n### Overview:\n\nQuestions regarding the precise nature of economic voting led to four general \"types\".\n\n1.  Retrospective Voting\n    1.  Originating with V.O. Key (1966), this type of voting occurs when voters review the performance of the incumbent government.\n2.  Prospective Voting\n    1.  Originating with Downs (1957), this type of voting occurs when voters look to the future and vote according to the governments potential economic performance.\n3.  Pocketbook Voting (personal finances)\n    1.  This theory of voting suggests that when personal or household financial conditions have deteriorated, voters will punish the incumbent.\n4.  Sociotropic Voting (national economy rather than personal finances).\n    1.  This theory of voting suggests that voters are more likely to be considering the national economic situation when casting their vote.\n\nOf these types, the retrospective sociotropic and prospective sociotropic appear to be the most relevant across empirical evaluations. That is, people tend to vote based of their perceptions of national economic performance, both in the past (retrospective sociotropic) and the future (prospective sociotropic). The type of voting that is cued depends on whether or not an incumbent is running, and therefore a reliable place to point blame. Essentially, the reward-punishment hypothesis holds up across settings, with slight variation according to group membership (party id, gender, etc.), institutional context (voting system, prime-minister v. president, number of parties) and economic context (personal, neighborhood, national).\n\n### Findings:\n\n#### United States:\n\n-   ANES is good source for election studies\n-   Most theories of economic voting focus on the U.S.\n-   Pocketbook voting is weak in presidential elections \\-- sociotropic is strong\n-   Strength of economic voting can cary based on context \\-- such is the case when considering the attribution of responsibility (e.g. the attribution of blame to particular party/candidate/branch of government)\n    -   in the U.S. the presidency is an important institutional context for which to blame punish electorally\n-   While other types of factors matter and interact them, sociotropic economic effects (both retrospective and prospective) themselves cannot be understated when assessing the general behavior of the voter population.\n\n#### Britain:\n\n-   BES is a good source for election studies\n-   British voters show the same trends of reward and punishment regarding economic voting\n-   There may be important regional contexts\n    -   Johnston 1997 finds that when voter's perceptions of their neighborhoods are that they are worse off, they will punish the incumbent\n-   Retrospective and Prospective are both important\n-   Perceptual shifts in economic conditions are almost as great as realigning with a different party (Clarke et al. 2004)\n\n#### France:\n\n-   Eurobarometer and FNES are good sources for election studies\n-   A general finding---significant retrospective sociotropic effects, but no retrospective pocketbook effects\n-   It is largely sociotropic and more or less equally retrospective or prospective, depending in part on the institutional context.\n-   The French voter is sophisticated, knowing whom and how much to blame.\n    -   When government is unified, the president is the lightning rod for economic discontent. However, under cohabitation, the burden shifts to the prime minister.\n-   Smaller parties are blamed less than large parties, legislative candidates are blamed less than presidential candidates, and presidential candidates who are prime minister are blamed more than presidential candidates who are not prime minister.\n\n#### Cross-National Studies:\n\n-   Similar trends have been found in cross-national studies\n    -   Lewis‐Beck and Mitchell (1990), on the five major western European countries; Chappell and Veiga (2000), on thirteen western European nations; Pacek (1994) and Tucker (2001) on central European samples; Remmer (1991) on twelve Latin American countries; Pacek and Radcli (1995) on eight low‐income nations; Wilkin, Haller, and Norporth (1997) on a worldwide sample of countries.\n-   Important Takeaways:\n    -   Responsibility Hypothesis seems to hold - that when responsibility is hard to pin down, voters are less likely to punish incumbents - this is an important contextual factors\n\n        -   Such is the case in more countries with more \"coalitional complexity\" \\-- when more parties make up the incumbent government, is it difficult to assign blame\n\n        -   Presidential Systems and systems with more restrictive electoral laws tend to strengthen the economic vote\n\n        -   In the context of globalization, there is a significant decrease in economic voting in the face of open trade, as electorates can't assign blame to the government alone\n\n# Week 7: Societal Cleavages\n\n## [Inglehart, Ronald, and Pippa Norris. 2003.

How much does culture matter for gender equality compared to levels of societal development and legal-institutional structures?\n\n### **Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  Societal modernization brings changed cultural attitudes toward gender equality through:\n\n    1.  a transition from traditional to secular-rational values, and\n\n    2.  a transition from survival to self-expression values.\n\n2.  These shifts are coherent and predictable, and can be shown through:\n\n    1.  Cross-national comparisons\n\n    2.

Inglehart & Norris describe social modernization and the gender equality attitudes that accompany it as \"probabilistic, not deterministic\" (11). But if these slow attitudinal changes are happening across the majority of the population, how do we account for democratic backsliding and the rise of violence against minorities in postindustrial countries following exogenous shocks/social strains? (think terrorist attacks, economic shocks like the 2008 recession, mass migration/immigration from Syria, etc.). Do we think that these represent latent variables that were always present? Are they blips along a long-term progressive path? Or do they represent something more insidious?\n\n### **General Notes:**\n\n-   This book sets out to understand how modernization has changed cultural attitudes toward gender equality and to analyze the political consequences of this process\n\n-   Core arguments: people's lives have been changed in 2-stage modernization process:\n\n    -   Shift from agrarian to industrialized societies\n\n    -   Move from industrial to postindustrial societies\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Chapter 1: Introduction -- Explaining the Rising Tide of Gender Equality\n\n    -   Women's progress worldwide uneven -- lagging in government representation\n\n    -   UN encouraged states to recognize women's rights through Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 1979\n\n        -   \"\\...the role of the state is now widely understood to be central in actively consolidating and reinforcing gender equality\" (7).\n\n    -   Cultural barriers: perceptions of appropriate division of roles in home and family, paid employment, and political spere shaped by predominant culture -- the social norms, beliefs, and values in society\n\n        -   Thes norms, beliefs and values rest on levels of societal modernization and religious traditions\n\n        -   Gender = the socially constructed roles and learned behavior of women and men associated with the biological characteristics of females and males\n\n        -   Cultural change not sufficient itself for gender equality but is a necessary condition for gender equality\n\n    -   Modernization brings systematic, predictable changes in gender roles in 2 phases:\n\n1.

When such is the case, both men and women have an incentive to cultivate their outside options by entering into paid work, and the distribution of unpaid work is determined by bargaining powers dependent upon the political-economic factors outside the family.\n\nWhat is important is that divorce is an option that varies across contexts. In places where divorce is a more viable, then outside options become important for long-term welfare. Meaning that both sexes will prefer social and economic policies that maximize these options, even if it reduces household income or other measures of aggregate welfare.\n\nMen are disincentivized to support their wives working because 1.) it increases her agency/options to exit the marriage and 2.) increases the amount of work he has to do in the home. Additionally, women in specific skills economies typically bear a bigger penalty for career interruptions such as for child rearing, they face more limited work opportunities and may invest less in their market-relevant education as a result. This, in turn, weakens their bargaining power at home, and they get stuck sweeping floors more of the time than their counterparts in economies that specialize in general skills. This occurs unless the government steps in and adopts policies to counter the disadvantages of women in specific skills countries. This is where the gender gap in preferences enters the story.\n\n## [Lijphart, Arend. 1979. \"Religious vs. Linguistic vs. Class Voting: The 'Crucial Experiment' of Comparing Belgium, Canada, South Africa and Switzerland.\" American Political Science Review 73(2): 442-458.](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:ec792f1c-b59a-4284-986e-ba6e93f80638)\n\n### **Bumper Sticker:**\n\nReligion and Language Highly Influence Voting Preferences!\n\n### **IV:**\n\nReligiosity, class, and language\n\n### **DV:**\n\nParty choice/voting behavior\n\n### **Research question:**\n\nHow do language and religion influence voter preferences?\n\n### **Data:**\n\n-   Survey data from 4 separate countries around roughly similar time periods\n\n### **Methods:**\n\n-   Multivariate analysis comparing 4 countries\n\n    -   AID technique -- automatic interaction detector (tree analysis)\n\n### **Findings:**\n\n-   In \"decisive trial of strength,\" religion is the most influential factor, followed closely by language, with class a distant third.\n\n### **Questions:**\n\n1.

To what extent do urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race?\n\n2.  Are these identities consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world?\n\n### Abstract:\n\nAs the American political landscape becomes increasingly divided along urban--rural lines, it raises the prospect of deepening social identities that are tied to one's community-type. As community-type becomes an important social identity, it can lead to favoritism of one's community in-group, or denigration of one's community out-group. We explore the extent to which urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race, and whether they are consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world. Using national survey data, we demonstrate that people in both urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors which are correlated with the urban--rural divide. We use two different experiments to assess the consequences of this identity, finding that there are distinct effects in the political arena when allocating government resources, and in the non-political world when judging hypothetical job applications. These effects are generally smaller in magnitude than other factors, such as partisanship, but suggest that community-type identities are important in politics.\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nLyons and Utych set out to assess what appears to be a growing divide between rural and urban party affiliation and voting patterns.They explore the extent to which people use information about rural and urban community types to form impressions about American politics, as well as how people use this information to make decisions about political and non-political matters. If people are using urban and rural identities in similar ways to partisanship, and partisanship uses group identity as a way of perceiving the world, then there is a chance that people may be using geographic information such as urban and rural community type to evaluate the political and interpersonal landscape around them.\n\nThey focus on discriminatory behaviors. If urban and rural community types are taking on the qualities of social identities, then the in-group and out-group processing of information along lines of community type should be salient. That is, those from urban (rural) locations should confer a preference to urban (rural) locations/people, and a penalty to rural (urban) locations/people when making decisions that allocate resources, benefits, or opportunities.\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\nUses three different studies\n\n### First Study:\n\n1.  First, uses National Survey Data to show that people perceive values differences between people who live in rural and urban places \\-- appear to be driven by more than just party or race\n\n    1.  do people who live in rural (urban) areas think that people who live in urban (rural) places are different than them, and do they think that they are getting an unfair shake from government relative to those who live in other community types?\n\n    2.  Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 32)\n\n    3.  Ordered logit\n\n#### IV:\n\nwhether the respondents live in urban or rural setting\n\n#### DV:\n\n1.  perceptions of others values\n\n    1.  used by creating a dichotomous variable from three survey questions (p.80)\n\n2.  perceptions of government distribution of resources across community types\n\n    1.  also created a dichotomous variable from survey questions (p.84-85)\n\n### Second Study:\n\n1.  Second, uses a conjoint experiment to explore where urban or rural identities are consequential for how people distribute resources in a hypothetical political scenario\n\n    1.  conducted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in July 2019.7 We recruited 572 respondents to participate in the study, who were paid \\$1.25 to participate in a study that took less than 10 min, on average.\n\n        1.  over representative of young, liberal, white, educated, male\n\n        2.  First, participants were provided a sample pairing of two cities, to familiarize themselves with the task. Participants were told they were in charge of allocating \\$50,000 in highway funding between two cities. These cities were randomly assigned to vary on three dimensions---location (urban, suburban, or rural), mayor partisanship (Republican, Democrat, or non-partisan), year of last investment (2006, 2012, or 2018), percentage African-American (5%, 20%, or 65%) and average household income (\\$30,000, \\$60,000, or \\$90,000). Each individual completed the practice trial, and then 15 test trials.\n\n        3.  key variation is based on the \"location\" variation, allowing us to compare how individuals allocate funding between urban, suburban, and rural areas.\n\n        4.  One observation for each trial includes city characteristics for City A, while the second observation includes city characteristics for City B.\n\n#### D.V.\n\n1.  the allocation decision between City A or City B, which takes a value of 1 if the respondent allocates funding to that city, and 0 if they allocate funding for the other city.\n\n#### Findings:\n\n1.  Find that rural identities influence opinions and that partisans react to urban and rural information in expected ways\n\n2.  Find that Democrats are more likely prefer urban areas to suburban areas, but not difference in the allocation of resources between Urban and Rural Republicans, however, are more likely to allocate to rural areas\n\n3.  No location based preferences for rural respondents\n\n### Third Study:\n\n1.  Third, uses a resume experience to test discrimination in a non-political setting, finding that people evaluate hypothetical job applicants more favorably when they are from the same community types\n\n    1.  recruited 1467 respondents via MTurk who live in urban or rural areas13 to participate in the study, who were paid \\$0.50 to participate in a study that took roughly 2.5 min to complete, on average.\n\n    2.  Participants shown a hypothetical resume and then asked to rate the applicant on a series of evaluative criteria/ traits\n\n    3.  participants had preference for co-location\n\n#### Expectations:\n\n-   urban and rural identities are formative for the way in which people view themselves and others, and it is in ways that go above and beyond race, partisanship, and other demographic or socioeconomic factors\n\n-   Democrats should discriminate in a fashion that confers favor to urban locations or people, while Republicans should show a preference for rural locations or people.\n\n### Findings:\n\n1.  Both urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors\n\n2.  Each identity has a distinct impact on the political arenas when is comes to allocating government resources\n\n3.  Also has an impact in the non-political world when judging job applications\n\n4.  Effects are smaller than other factors, such as partisanship\n\n5.  Less educated community residents are more likely to perceive values difference\n\n    1.  In rural places, so are younger people, males, whites, liberals, and non-religious service attenders\n\n    2.  results are particularly related to rural areas\n\n6.  For government resources\n\n    1.  People who are older, more educated, Republicans and very conservative are the most likely to believe that urban area get more than their fair share of resources. By far the largest effect is from ideology (0.57 change in predicted probability across the full range), with partisanship (0.47 change in predicted probability) and age (0.22 change in predicted probability) also resulting in meaningful changes in predicted probabilities.\n\n7.  urban residents appear to have a well-defined out group, but it isn't rural areas, it is the suburbs\n\n## Posner, Daniel N. 2004. \"The Political Salience of Cultural Difference: Why Chewas and Tumbukas Are Allies in Zambia and Adversaries in Malawi.\" American Political Science Review 98(4): 529-545.\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nWhen it comes to groups, relative size matters\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhy do some cultural differences matter for politics and others not?\n\n### IV:\n\nPolitical salience of cultural difference\n\n### DV:\n\nRelative group size for coalition-building= cultural demography theory\n\n### Unit of Analysis:\n\ncultural dyad= relationship between the two groups on either side of the border, not the individual ethnic group\n\n### Data/Methods:\n\nCollect data on the border in July and August 2001: questionnaire in 4 villages/each pair facing each other across the border.\n\n• Homogeneity of populations (equidistant from Ngoni population that could have \"contaminated\" the sample villages)\n\n• Similarity, control naturally for geo and eco factors by choosing pairs in the same vicinitude\n\n• Exposed to similar national political affairs and markets (proxied by paved routes)\n\n• 42 interviews in each Zambia villages/48 in each Malawi villages= 180 total obs.\n\n• Focus groups as supplement\n\n### Findings:\n\n• Each group understand objective differences (Malawians more negative about the other)\n\n• Difference in how they would allow the other group to integrate their lives politically or in the family sphere= Malawi side prefers separation at more than 50% on average where it is 20% on the other side (series of categorical mean tested differences)\n\n• Biggest predictor is the physical location of the village NOT objective cultural difference.\n\n• The physical location makes a political salience of intergroup difference=how much they attach meaning to their differences (537)= Meaning-making (Wedeen)\n\n# Week 8: Protests/Social Movements/Violence\n\n## [Dalton, Russell, Alix Van Sickle and Steven Weldon. 2009. \"The Individual-Institutional Nexus of Protest Behavior.\" British Journal of Political Science 40(1): 51-73.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kq4S_aM2ddveYWCsxkZb4ejNH4MVVIxc/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nmicro-macro multilevel analysis matters in political action behavior\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhat kind of individual/contextual interplay favors a behavior inclined to political action such as protests?\n\n### IV:\n\nprotest behavior\n\n### DV:\n\nmicro-macro nexus\n\n### Findings:\n\nThe cultural modernization theory of protest: economic and political development favors protests helping resources such as education and membership to organization (akin to Klandermans) to flourish fostering mobilization =/ grievance is a predictor in developing countries.\n\n## [Klandermans, Bert. 2002. \"How Group Identification Helps to Overcome the Dilemma of Collective Action.\" American Behavioral Scientist 45(5): 887-900.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S4TwUxNJnRC-Cq1HTvDxr8g_3Ht5ZzLU/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nvoluntary membership to ID group matters for political action such as protests\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhich type of group identification will spur political action?\n\n### IV:\n\nprotest\n\n### DV:\n\ntype of group id (cognitive, evaluative, affective)\n\n### Mechanism:\n\ndepersonalization and politicization\n\n### Findings:\n\nAffective and behavioral ID predisposes political action such as protest and protest participation solidifies behavioral ID.\n\n### Depersonalization:\n\n-   individual become the member of a group\n\n-   which group will the individual adhere to?

(the scholars didn't like the social movements so that is why their theories are rather dismissive of the people that make them up.)**\n\n1.  **Pre 1960 Perspective -** In social movements, people lose their individuality and become susceptible to irrational behavior, which may include great bravery and sacrifice for the group, but also uncontrolled violence towards outsiders. Mostly negative view of social movements. \n\n    1.  \"Crowd-psychological ideas\" - Max Weber (charismatic leadership), Emile Durkheim (collective conscience), Gustave Le Bon. \n\n2.  **Adorno perspective -** \"In search for new social anchors, the uprooted and isolated individuals of mass society were seen as easy targets for totalitarian mass movements of the left and right. Such movements were moreover seens as attracting particular types of 'authoritarian' personalities.\"\n\n    1.  Motivated by theories of \"mass society\"\n\n    2.  Rapid social change was seen as breaking down traditional social ties and norms.\n\n3.  **Theories of Relative Deprivation -** gap between what people get and what they expect and aspire to get on the basis of past trends and comparisons with other groups.\n\n    1.  Deprivation leads to frustration and striking out at perceived sources of anger.\n\n### Resource Mobilization Perspective:\n\n**1960s radical movements changed everything. Mancur Olson's economic theory of collective action changes everything.**\n\n1.  **Mancur Olson perspective** - social movements were interpreted as rational, utility maximizing actors, and new vocabulary. \n\n    1.  Basically rat choice.\n\n    2.  Emphasized group solidarity and the integration of individuals into social networks rather than breakdown of social norms and social uprootedness. Not just a bunch of isolated weirdos. - **KEY DIFFERENCE FROM CLASSICAL PERSPECTIVE.**\n\n    3.  Problems with it: downplays context and just typical issues with rat choice.\n\n### Political Opportunity Structure Perspective:\n\n**Want more focus on external factors in shaping social movements. Mobilization + classical theories focused on internal factors.**\n\n1.  **Political opportunity structures** - argue that variations in the amount and types of social movement activity can be explained by variations in the political context that they confront. \n\n    1.  Social movement structure/existence is related to factors such as electoral volatility, composition of party system, inst. Centralization, separation of powers, political elites.\n\n    2.  Contrast French protests to Swiss protests. French are bigger because of more centralization.\n\n    3.  Still problematic - diminishes the conception of agency. Opportunities are not decided by external factors but creative individuals that set the plan/agenda. \n\n### Evolutionary Model Perspective:\n\n**Focus on interplay of movement-external (environmental selection) and internal (variation/innovation and retention/diffusion) elements.**\n\n-   New model.\n\n-   Does not require strong assumptions about cognitive or psychological mechanisms that generate strategic decisions of movement activists and their opponents.\n\n-   Bridge between agency-orientated and structural perspective within social movement research.\n\n## [Thomas, Jakana L., and Kanisha D.

As a VPO grows larger, it is more likely to include women participants.\n\n2.  VPOs that rely on terrorist tactics are more likely to involve women than organizations that do not use terrorism.\n\n3.  VPOs with agendas that support gender equality are more likely to include women than organizations with gender-neutral agendas.\n\n4.  The likelihood of women's participation in a given VPO is related to the number of other violent organizations operating in its politically-relevant environment.\n\n### Data:\n\n-   Mix of qual/quant; original cross-sectional dataset on presence of women, women's roles and key organizational-level characteristics of 166 violent political orgs across 19 African countries 1950-2011\n\n### Methods:\n\n-   Purposive stratified sampling to select 19 countries\n\n-   logistic regression models in multivariate setting; 4 sets of results each (see Tables 3 & 4)\n\n    -   Base model in column 1\n\n    -   Full set of explanatory variables column 2\n\n    -   Controls in supply-related characteristics column 3\n\n    -   Controls for any additional group-level covariate column 4\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Organization-based opportunities for women's participation explain female membership in violent political organizations.\n\n### Questions:\n\n1.  Is this generalizable (lol)?\n\n2.  I get the impression that the leadership of VPOs is/assumed to be men. Is this the case? Are there examples of VPOs led by women?\n\n3.  There also appears to be an assumption that women participate in VPOs for rational reasons such as being victimized, fighting for increased political rights, etc. Outside of Islamic fundamentalism, are there other ways in which women can be radicalized to participate in violence that the study fails to control for?\n\n### General Notes:\n\n-   Most studies ignore women's participation in VPOs\n\n-   If they do examine this phenomenon, it's through case studies or small-N studies, and focused on \"supply-side\" dynamics (what characteristics condition women towards violence) rather then \"demand-side\" dynamics (ways in which different organizational preferences & behaviors work to facilitate or impede women's presence in VPOs)\n\n    -   \"Women's voluntary participation in violent politics is tied invariably to the availability of opportunities\" (489)\n\n-   3 assumptions:\n\n1.  Recruiter and female participants choose purposefully among action alternatives to maximize benefits and minimize costs (everyone thinks like an economist)\n\n2.

Instead, the authors explore the content of these events. The goal of the paper is to check the plausibility of tentative thesis - that mass violence can be perceived through a rationalist framework\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nTraditional explanations for why insurgent groups choose to engage is mass violence have focused primarily on ideology as the main explanatory factor. The authors argue that, counter to traditional accounts, mass violence against civilians is strategic with aims of maximizing civilian support. They sketch a theoretical framework for the analysis of civil wars to see how it fares in one particular case: insurgent violence in Algeria. \n\n### Method/Finding:\n\n-   Focus on insurgent violence in Algeria in 1996 during the civil war, which started in 1992 after the Algerian Military (Incumbents) \"aborted\" the parliamentary election and terminated democracy \n\n    -   This deprived the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of a sweeping victory and they eventually become outlawed insurgents that formed into two groups - the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) and the GIA (which is believed to have contributed to most of the Massacres. \n\n-   Generalized out to other countries at the end of the paper. \n\n-   They find that Massacres tend to happen under conditions of fragmented rule, support for the incumbent state, and escalating violence.\n\n-   They were not random, but attacked specific neighborhoods\n\n    -   Families of sympathizers were left alone \n\n    -   Victims belonged to three groups\n\n        -   Local opponents who supported incumbents \n\n        -   People supporting competing insurgent groups \n\n        -   Former sympathizers who switched allegiance (most targeted this group)\n\n### Definitions:\n\n-   **Massacre**\n\n    -   Defined narrowly as large-scale, face-to-face violence against civilians targeted in groups and in the context of a civil war.\n\n-   **Violence**\n\n    -   Measure in it most basic form: homicide \n\n## [Hjerm, M., Eger, M.A., Bohman, A. 2020.

To address this issue, this research aims to differentiate between the two.\n\n    -   conflation of tolerance with prejudice has made it difficult to understand what tolerance truly means and how it differs from dislike or disapproval of certain groups.\n\n    -   distinguishing analytically between tolerance and prejudice. \n\n    -   define tolerance as an abstract value orientation towards diversity, without focusing on specific groups, ideas, or behaviors. This allows authors to analyze tolerance both within societies and across different societies.\n\n    -   suggests that tolerance is best understood as a three-dimensional concept, involving acceptance of, respect for, and appreciation of difference.\n\n    -   found that only an appreciation of difference has the potential to reduce prejudice.\n\n        -   demonstrates the validity of these measures and their independence from welfare attitudes. \n\n        -   Results suggest that only an appreciation of difference can reduce prejudice, but relationship btwn tolerance/other outcomes remain unclear.\n\n-   There are two main approaches to studying tolerance. \n\n    -   The first sees tolerance as permitting something disliked, suggesting that prejudice is necessary for tolerance. \n\n        -   This view implies that one can only be tolerant if they've been prejudiced before. Empirical studies following this approach often start with the assumption that certain groups are widely disliked.\n\n        -   However, this method makes it hard to separate tolerance from prejudice in practice.\n\n    -   The second approach defines tolerance as a positive response to diversity itself, without requiring prior prejudice. \n\n        -   This view focuses on subjective reactions to diverse values, behaviors, and lifestyles. \n\n        -   Although this conceptualization is analytically distinct from prejudice, previous studies using this definition still rely on measures of prejudice, limiting our understanding of tolerance.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Both approaches have methodological issues. They either link tolerance closely to prejudice or fail to measure tolerance in a way consistent with its definition. \n\n    -   Additionally, previous research has often overlooked the multidimensionality of tolerance and lacks abstraction in its conceptualization and measurement. \n\n    -   To address these limitations, the study advances a new conception of tolerance and develops measures consistent with this definition, avoiding the pitfalls of previous approaches.\n\n    -   propose a new understanding of tolerance as a value orientation towards difference, which focuses on how individuals respond to diversity itself rather than merely putting up with disliked aspects. \n\n    -   This definition is abstract and distinct from previous concepts, not requiring the identification of objectionable groups or behaviors. \n\n-   draw on Forst's dimensions of tolerance: \n\n    -   Acceptance\n\n    -   respect for difference\n\n    -   appreciation of difference.\n\n        -   These dimensions represent different levels of engagement with diversity, ranging from basic acceptance to a deeper appreciation. \n\n        -   this approach allows for the measurement of various expressions of tolerance without relying on specific groups or behaviors, making our measures politically and temporally neutral. \n\n        -   This framework provides a clearer understanding of tolerance and facilitates its empirical investigation.\n\n        -   8 positively worded items were selected to capture three dimensions of tolerance: acceptance, respect, and appreciation. \n\n-   Descriptive statistics show moderate to high levels of tolerance among respondents\n\n## [Sears, David O., and Christia Brown. 2013. \"Childhood and Adult Political Development.\" Ch. 3 in Leonie Huddy, David O.

The use of this framework provides some helpful insights: \n\n1.  Is addresses the constant tension between continuity and change as played out throughout an individuals lifespan\n\n2.  It helps us to understand the origins of orientations that are politically consequential among adults, whether concerning politics specifically or intergroup relations. \n\n### Findings:\n\nThis review has suggested that partisan predispositions are most likely to be acquired in early development, if not quite as uniformly early as originally thought.\n\n\\\n\n-   The authors suggest that this is due the role of \"time\" which is treated as an independent variable that takes three forms\n\n    -   The persisting effects of early experiences\n\n    -   The major events or \"the times\" that characterize the environment an individual has experienced \n\n    -   The life stages of development - children, adolescents, adults all have different cognitive capabilities \n\n-   Based on the various ways fo thinking about time, the authors pose four alternative models of the full political life cycel that are often contrasted in the literature and which speak to Campbell's conception of party identification being shaped by early learning behavior, persistence, and later influence on voting behavior. \n\n    -   four alternative models of the full political life cycle have often been contrasted: \n\n    -   \\(1\\) persistence: the residues of preadult learning persist through life; \n\n    -   \\(2\\) a variant, impressionable years: orientations are particularly susceptible to influence in late adolescence and early adulthood, but tend to stabilize thereafter\n\n    -   \\(3\\) its major alternative, lifelong openness: individuals remain open to influence throughout later life, including by \"the times\"\n\n    -   \\(4\\) life cycle: people show distinctive specific propensities at different stages of life (this one is particularly difficult to pin down)\n\n### Definitions:\n\n-   The Life-History Perspective\n\n    -   a theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time.\n\n### Additional Things:\n\n\\\n\n-   The life history perspective of political development is a theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time. This perspective views political development as akin to the life cycle of an organism, with distinct stages of growth, maturation, decline, and potential renewal.\n\n\\\n\nKey features of the life history perspective of political development include:\n\n\\\n\n1.  **Stages of Development:** Similar to biological life cycles, political systems are seen to progress through various stages of development. These stages may include periods of consolidation, expansion, crisis, and transformation. Each stage is characterized by specific challenges, opportunities, and dynamics.\n\n2.  **Adaptation to Environmental Pressures:** Just as organisms adapt to their environments to survive and thrive, political systems must adapt to changing societal, economic, and environmental conditions. This may involve institutional reforms, policy adjustments, or shifts in political strategies to address new challenges or opportunities.\n\n3.  **Resource Allocation and Trade-offs:** The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resource allocation and trade-offs in political development. Political systems must allocate scarce resources, such as financial capital, human capital, and political capital, among competing priorities and objectives. Decisions about resource allocation may have long-term implications for the trajectory of political development.\n\n4.  **Reproduction and Inheritance:** Political systems often inherit institutional legacies, cultural norms, and social structures from previous generations. These inherited traits shape the opportunities and constraints faced by contemporary political actors and influence the trajectory of political development. Similarly, political systems may reproduce themselves through processes of institutional continuity, elite reproduction, and socialization.\n\n5.  **Variation and Diversity:** Just as biological organisms exhibit variation and diversity within and across species, political systems display variation and diversity in their structures, institutions, and practices. The life history perspective recognizes that different political systems may follow distinct trajectories of development due to historical legacies, cultural norms, and contextual factors.\n\n6.  **Adaptive Responses to External Shocks:** Political systems may face external shocks and disruptions, such as economic crises, wars, or natural disasters, that necessitate adaptive responses. The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resilience and flexibility in responding to external shocks and maintaining political stability and legitimacy.\n\nPartisanship is apparently a really salient predictor of mate choice lol \n\n## [Tajfel, Henri. 1982. \"Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations.\" Annual Review of Psychology 33(1): 1-39.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mLchlExlNAm-pkiHX0NpuEbTuIq74j6K/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**AWFUL READ! NEVER WRITE A LIT REVIEW LIKE THIS GUY!!!!**\n\n**I did my best to try to take the major themes of each section but he just throws every possible research paper on the subject at you. Literally a whirlwind of information.**\n\n### Introduction:\n\nIntergroup behavior: \"Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, collectively or individually, with another group or its members in terms of their group identification, we have an instance of intergroup behavior.\"\n\n### What is a group?:\n\n-   external : outside designations. Ex - bank clerks, hospital patients, etc.\n\n-   Internal: \"group identification\" \n\n    -   To achieve \"identification\" \n\n        -   cognitive - awareness and membership \n\n        -   Evaluative one - awareness is related to some value connotation\n\n        -   Emotional investment in awareness and evaluations. \n\n### Individual Process in Intergroup Behavior:\n\n1.  From Individual to Group Impressions\n\n    1.  **How cognitive structures determine certain aspects of intergroup attitudes.**\n\n        1.  We are trying to understand cognitive processes and relate it to interpersonal behavior.\n\n    2.  Discussion of stereotypes \n\n        1.  Cognitive mechanism: since members of minority groups often represent \"infrequent\" stimuli and therefore a conjunction of their relatively rare appearance with some of their actions lends itself to the construction of \"illusionary correlations\" and thus to stereotyping.\" \n\n    3.  Solo status research: When an individual is not part of the group or they are \"solo\" (think Black man with a group of white men), the Black man will have polarized evaluations compared with evaluations of the same person identified as belonging to the majority group. Aka more variation in view of Black man from white colleagues compared to less variation in view of white guy by white colleagues. \n\n        1.  Note: this is not equal across group identities. Some groups still face this issue more than others when the group is mixed. Seems kind of like a primitive concept of intersectionality being developed. \n\n### Group Membership and Intergroup Behavior\n\n1.  The Scope and range of Ethnocentrism\n\n    1.  Sumner coins term\n\n        1.  Also develops ingroup/outgroup\n\n        2.  Argues ethnocentrism is universal\n\n            1.  Not exactly true \n\n                1.

In sum, \"which differences are emphasized under what circumstances appears to be flexible and context dependent; this flexibility permits individuals to mobilize different group identities for different purposes.\"\n\n2.  The Development of Ethnocentrism\n\n    1.  Lots of debate \n\n    2.  Children adopt status + image of their group from outgroup (sometimes) \n\n        1.  Tension between status development from perception of both ingroup and outgroup\n\n    3.  The growth of group self respect in underprivileged minorities, closely related to socioeconomic, political, and psychological changes both inside the group and outside of it, would result in a corresponding decrease of ingroup devaluations and of low comparative expectancies. \n\n        1.  Long process. \n\n        2.  Sociopsych transformation is the effect of socioeconomic and political change. \n\n3.  Intergroup Conflict and Competition\n\n    1.  Interpersonal and intergroup behavior\n\n        1.  Two different approaches \n\n            1.  The \"interpersonal extreme\" defined as interaction between two or more individuals which is very largely determined by their individual characteristics and the nature of the personal relations between them - Deutsch\n\n            2.  The \"intergroup extreme\" defined as interactions which are largely determined by group memberships of the participants and very little-if at all-by their personal relations or individual characteristics. - sherif \n\n    2.  Intergroup conflict and group cohesion\n\n        1.  Does conflict promote greater cohesion inside the groups engaged in it? At the limit, can conflict create a cohesive group where only a loose structure existed before? \n\n            1.  Yes, but conditions. \n\n                1.  What happens if all members of a group are not equally affected by the conflict?\n\n                2.  Or when the consensus about threat, when it is dubious, cannot be transformed by the leadership into an \"authoritatively enforced cohesion\"?\n\n                3.  Or if a group is unable to deal with threat or to provide emotional support? \n\n        2.  There is a connection between in group cohesion and intergroup conflict\n\n    3.  Power and status in intergroup behavior \n\n        1.  Initially a peripheral focus in the field. But gaining steam. Four research trends \n\n            1.  Functioning of minorities\n\n            2.  The experimentally induced effects of intergroup power relations \n\n            3.  The effects of status on intergroup attitudes \n\n            4.  Role played in intergroup behavior by the perceived illegitimacy and/or instability of social differentials. \n\n4.  Social categorization and intergroup behavior \n\n    1.  Social categorization: cognitions, values, and groups \n\n        1.  Stereotypes are categorization.\n\n            1.  Cognitive function: resulting in the accentuation of similarities and differences, was the utilization of the category membership of individual items for ordering, systematizing, and simplifying the complex network of social groups confront individuals in their social environment\n\n            2.  Value functionL resulted in a still more emphatic accentuation of these same, similarities and differences when they were associated with subjective value differentials applying to social categories. \n\n            3.  \"As a result of the categorization process, within-group differences become minimized and between-group differences become exaggerated\"\n\n                1.  Salience of identity? \n\n            4.  The value and cognitive functions of social accentuation provide a basis for the understanding of the structure and direction of biases in intergroup attitudes and stereotypes, but they cannot tell us very much about the contents of the groups' reciprocal conceptions. \n\n    2.  Social categorization and intergroup discrimination\n\n        1.  Boys and holiday camp experiment. Once boys found out about other groups existence they started to form ingroup-outgroup identities before anything started. \n\n            1.  What are the minimal conditions that would create intergroup discrimination? \n\n        2.  Common fate\n\n    3.  Social identity and social comparison \n\n        1.  Social identity is defined as \"the part of the individuals' self-concept which derives from their knowledge of their membership of a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional significance of that membership.\" \n\n        2.  \"The social group is seen to function as a provider of positive social identity for its members through comparing itself, and distinguishing itself, from other comparison groups along salient dimensions which have a clear value differential\"\n\n### The Reduction of Intergroup Discrimination:\n\n### Intergroup Cooperation and superordinate Goals \n\n1.  Intergroup cooperation leads to less discrimination than intergroup competition. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n1.  Intergroup Contact\n\n    1.  It is just like one paragraph?

It overlooked the fact that democracy not only required popular participation but that elected leaders had also to govern, and that governing required obligation, patience, and trust. It was this necessary mix of activism and participation with other important ingredients that The Civic Culture celebrated.\" (preface) \n\n### Chapter 1: An Approach to Political Culture:\n\n-   Political culture of democracy and the social structures and processes that sustain it. \n\n    -   A new political world culture is developing. \n\n        -   \"Participation explosion\"\n\n    -   \"What must be learned about democracy is a matter of attitude and feeling, and this is harder to learn\". (p.4) \n\n-   **The Civic Culture:**\n\n    -   Combines modernity with tradition\n\n    -   A culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permeated change but moderated it\n\n    -   \"The working class could enter into politics and, in a process of trial and error, find the language in which to couch their demands and the means to make them effective\" (p.6) - kinda reminds me of historical institutionalism. \n\n    -   Individuals are not only oriented to political input, they are also orientated positively to the input structures and the input process. \n\n        -   The civic culture is a participant political culture in which the political culture and political structure are congruent. P.30 \n\n-   What is democratic culture? How does it spread? What attitudes and behaviors must be present to create democracy?\n\n-   Democracy is maintained by an active citizenry. More info, more involvement, and a sense of civic responsibility are essential. \n\n-   Looks at 5 countries: United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, and Mexico\n\n    -   A bit concerned about these choices. \n\n    -   These countries help escape an American focus - I disagree. \n\n-   **Political Culture:**\n\n    -   Refers specifically to political orientations - attitudes toward the political system and its various parts, and attitudes towards the role of the self in the system. \n\n    -   Psychological orientation to social objects. \n\n    -   When we speak of the political culture of a society, we refer to the political system as internalized in the cognitions, feelings, and evaluations of its population. People are inducted into it just as they are socialized into nonpolitical roles and social systems. P.13 \n\n-   The political culture of a nation is a particular distribution of patterns of orientation toward political objects among the members of a nation. What are those orientations? (see below) \n\n-   **Political Orientation:**\n\n    -   Orientation refers to the internalized aspects of objects and relationships.\n\n    -   Includes three types: \n\n        -   1\\) cognitive orientation - knowledge and belief about political system\n\n        -   2\\) affective orientation - feelings about political system \n\n        -   3\\) evaluational orientation - judgments and opinions about political objects \n\n-   We have classified orientation but we now must classify objects of political orientation. \n\n    1.  System as general object \n\n    2.  Input objects  \n\n    3.  Output objects \n\n    4.  Self as object \n\n-   Characterizing political culture is done by understanding the various orientations toward the various objects. The types of political culture according to the authors are: \n\n    1.  Parochial Political Culture\n\n    2.  Subject Political Culture \n\n    3.  Participant Political Culture \n\n-   \"In the civic culture participant political orientations combine with and do not replace subject and parochial political orientations. Individuals become participants in the political process, but they do not give up their orientations as subjects or parochials.\" p.30 \n\n-   \"Thus attitudes favorable to participation within the political system play a major role in the civic culture, but so do such nonpolitical attitudes as trust in other people and social participation in general. The maintenance of these more traditional attitudes and their fusion with the participant orientations lead to a balanced political culture in which political activity, involvement, and rationality exist but are balanced by passivity, traditionality, and commitment to parochial values.\" p.30\n\n-   **The connecting link between micro and macro politics is political culture.**\n\n-   Survey of 5 nations - 1000 interviews in each country. Interviews take place in 1959. US takes place in 1960\n\n### Chapter 2: Patterns of Political Cognition\n\n-   Recall the classification types of political culture: Parochial, Subject, Participant. \n\n    -   Of the 5 countries - parochial and subject are rare. \n\n1.  Measures of cognitive content and processes:\n\n    1.  How much importance is attributed to national and local government\n\n    2.  Awareness and exposure of and exposure to politics and public affairs \n\n    3.  Political information adult population possesses \n\n    4.  Measure of the readiness of these populations to make choices or entertain opinions about political issues and problems.\n\n-   The impact of government: To what extent do the people in these countries perceive government as having an effect on them as individuals? To what extent do they see their lives as related to the activities of governments? \n\n    -   Americans and British respondents in the great majority perceive an impact of their national and local governments and ascribe high favorability \n\n    -   Germans are similar but a larger percentage are more skeptical in saying the governments sometime improved conditions \n\n    -   Italians attribute high favorability to gov \n\n    -   Minority of Mexicans attribute significance to the government and is skeptical in the benefits of the government. \n\n    -   From the results the authors say: \n\n        -   US, Britain, German are bulk \"allegiants\" \n\n        -   Italy, and mexico (mainly mexico) are majority subject and parochial. \n\n    -   Education correlated with awareness of the significance of the government\n\n-   Awareness of politics: Do people pay attention to political and governmental affairs (even campaigns)?\n\n    -   The civic culture, as we use the term, includes a sense of obligation to participate in political input activities, as well as a sense of competence to participate. \n\n    -   Education correlated with higher interest.\n\n-   Having information and Opinions: Can people identify national leaders and can people identify cabinet offices or departments at the national level of government? \n\n    -   Germans, English, and Americans have higher well-informed respondents. \n\n    -   Mexico the worst\n\n    -   Except italy, low information high opinions are common\n\n    -   british , American, and germans are more cognitively oriented to the input and output of government\n\n        -   Mexicans and Italians are alienated and parochial.\n\n### Chapter 3: Feeling Toward Government and Politics\n\n-   Generalized attitudes toward the whole: toward the nation, its virtues, accomplishments,\n\n    -   System affect: see above \n\n        -   National pride \n\n            -   \"Speaking generally, what are the aspects of this country that you are most proud of?\"\n\n            -   Italians have more pride in items not related to politics \n\n            -   Americans and British had higher rates of indicating government/political/public policy items. \n\n            -   Germans are less prideful in politics. More prideful in science contributions, economy, and personal virtues. \n\n            -   Mexicans are interested in politics and have high political pride\n\n                -   Is the Mexican revolution responsible?\n\n            -   Better occupation correlates with more political pride \n\n                -   Except in germany and Italy \n\n                    -   Suggests alienation from system\n\n                        -   Both have fascist past? \n\n    -   Output affect: expectations of treatment by government and police\n\n        -   Attitudes toward the executive/gov affecting respondents. \n\n        -   If expected to treat fairly then we expect favorability to government authority from respondent \n\n        -   Respondents were asked two hypotheticals \n\n            -   Mexicans continually are more alienated\n\n            -   Police had high favorability...more than government officials - except in mexico. \n\n    -   Input affect \n\n        -   Feelings people have about the agencies and processes involved in the election of public officials and enactment of general public policies. \n\n        -   Concerned with face-to-face communication.\n\n        -   Measures:\n\n            -   How much do respondents report discussing politics \n\n                -   Talking politics is an active form of politics\n\n                    -   Mass media is passive \n\n                        -   Are people becoming more passive in politics? \n\n                -   Talking politics also indicates some sense of safety in political communication.\n\n## [Avdeenko, Alexandra, and Michael J.

What elements of the communist experience explain this?\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n1.  Civic participation lags in post-communist countries due to (1) mistrust of Communist organizations, (2) the persistence of friendship networks (private networks), and (3) post-Communist disappointment.\n\n2.  For societal change to occur and last, (1) new institutions must be authoritative and binding, (2) they should build upon existing traditions and culture, and (3) several decades and generations are needed to change people's habits and acculturation.\n\n### Data:\n\n-   1995-1997 World Values Survey and Post-Communist Organizational Membership Study (PCOMS) survey of 1999\n\n### Methods:\n\n-   Multivariate OLS regression analysis\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Participation in voluntary organizations is much lower in post-communist countries in Eastern Europe than in the older democracies and post-authoritarian countries (with exception of labor unions).\n\n### Questions:\n\n1.  Looking closely at the descriptive data and the OLS results, do we see Eastern Germany more closely associated with Russia or with Western Germany? Why do you think this is? How well does this fit with Howard's hypothesis?\n\n2.  Is this generalizable? (LOLOLOLOL)\n\n3.  Do you buy voluntary organization participation as a measure of civil societal health? Why or why not?\n\n4.  If you wanted to expand upon this study (or even replicate it), how would you design it differently?\n\n### General Note:\n\n-   This book explores how people adapt to a new democracy (looking at post-communist Europe)\n\n    -   Specifically focused on civil society as crucial part of public space between state and family, and embodied in **voluntary organizations**\n\n    -   Seeks to explain why post-communist civil society is weak\n\n-   Post-Communist Europe\n\n    -   Remarkably low rates of participation in voluntary organizations of civil society\n\n    -   Non-democratic countries not represented\n\n    -   2 scholarly approaches:\n\n        -   Contemporary political and economic attributes and policies the most important factors explaining and predicting cross-national variation\n\n        -   Causal variables are legacies of communism -- historical/cultural context\n\n    -   Societal similarities resistant to change even while political institutions have\n\n-   Case studies\n\n    -   Russia & East Germany\n\n        -   Economic levels high in East Germany but low in Russia\n\n        -   Political and legal institutions well developed in EG but Russian systems weak and underdeveloped\n\n        -   Both societies belong to different cultural and religious civilizations\n\n        -   Substantial variation provides maximal analytic leverage for explaining causes of similarly low levels of civic participation\n\n-   The Organization of the Book\n\n    -   Theory\n\n    -   Empirical results\n\n    -   Causal explanation using 2 different methodological approaches\n\n        -   \"Experiential\" approach to societal continuity and change = individuals are agents who make choices\n\n        -   **For societal change to occur and last, 3 factors must take place:**\n\n1.  **New institutions must be authoritative and binding.**\n\n2.  **Institutions should build upon existing traditions and culture.**\n\n3.  **Several decades and generations are needed to change people's habits and acculturation.**\n\n-   Ch. 2: 3 main individual-level causal factors that guide empirical analysis:\n\n1.  Most post-communist citizens still strongly mistrust and avoid organizations, even now that participation is voluntary.\n\n2.  Many of the private and informal networks that developed under communism -- because of the politicization and state control of the public sphere, as well as the shortage economy -- still persist today in an altogether new institutional environment, and they serve as a disincentive for many people to join formal organizations.\n\n3.  Many post-communist citizens are extremely dissatisfied with the new political and economic system which hasn't lived up to their hopes and ideals, and their disappointment has caused them to withdraw even further from public activities.\n\n-   Ch. 3: conceptual analysis of civil society\n\n    -   Linz & Stepan's 5 \"arenas\" of democratization:\n\n1.  Civil society\n\n2.  Political society\n\n3.  Economic society\n\n4.  The rule of law\n\n5.

business associations, professional organizations, reading clubs, film clubs, sports clubs, NGOs, trade unions, and cadre-based political parties\n\n    -   Everyday forms of engagement = informal civic interaction;

This paper tests the internet's effect at a more antecedent and foundational stage of political behavior. Past literature looks at the internet's influence after people have already moved to act and organize. \n\n2.  The second contribution is methodological. A field experiment can provide direct causal tests. This is a first for this body of research.\n\n### Theory:\n\nWhy would the internet have an effect on political organization?\n\n\"Mirror-Holding\" - The internet enables more people to mirror hold. What does this mean? \n\n-   The Internet holds up a mirror for users to better discern and reflect on how their government is actually performing. \n\n-   The global nature of the Internet also opens more panoramic windows that better enable individuals to view how governments function in other countries, particularly the high-functioning democracies that tend to be most visible on the Internet. This provides users with a more realistic and globally consistent scale by which to make comparative evaluations about their own government's performance. \n\nThe internet provides more information to citizens, from a broader range of perspectives, than would otherwise be the case-thus improving the capacity of citizens to make more informed evaluations of their governments. \n\n-   Reminds me a bit of Kevin Munger supply and demand perspective of youtube. \n\nBy providing a venue to publicly document government's failure or abuses, often coupled with pictures and videos, individuals more readily link their personal experiences to a much larger, pervasive, and entrenched national trend.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nThis the internet will provide a more robust and different set of information regarding the integrity of the Tanzania election compared to that provided by the traditional media.\n\n### Method:\n\nField Experiment:\n\n-   Focus: 2010 Tanzania elections \n\n    -   Why?: 2010 elections were not deemed fully free and fair? \n\n        -   Uchaguzi (an internet platform) allowed people to create a visual map of where election abuses were reported - allowing citizens to view and reflect on it. \n\n        **Unit of analysis:** Tanzanian individuals \n\n    Subjects were recruited in person at several congregation points in the community of Morogoro. Morgogoro is 120 miles away from the economic capital. 200k population. 200 names were collected. Using random assignment, 70 respondents were given the internet treatment and 70 respondents were given the no-internet control condition. \n\n    Subjects were asked to meet at internet cafes. Pre Surveys were given. Individuals then had access to the internet at the cafe for 2 months. Control group was not given internet time but would gain it after the experiment was over. No restrictions were put on how respondents used the internet. After 2 months, respondents were contacted again for a post survey.\n\n### Results:\n\n-   Treatment group had less faith in a fair election and believed the recount was less fair. \n\n-   Users with facebook accounts were more likely to think the election was unfair.\n\n-   Treatment was also more likely to trust the police force.\n\n-   \\*\\*\\*Internet users who became more aware of electoral abuses also may have become less likely to believe that their vote mattered as a consequence. While some protested, others simply stayed home. \n\n    -   The internet may be a double edged sword. \n\n-   The internet can alter the cost-benefit calculus of political behavior by expanding the range of information individuals have regarding their government's actual performance.\n\n-   Members of the disaffected Internet group were less likely to vote. \n\n    -   Showing internet is not the amazing positive force we thought it was \n\n        -   This is obvious now but in 2010 not so much! \n\n### Stone's Thoughts:\n\nI love this article! The theory section regarding how the internet influences political behavior is really intuitive. I think I have a good understanding for how the internet influenced all of us and how it culminated into Trump and the polarization across the world. Let me (attempt) to explain my perspective. \n\n-   For the masses: The internet increased communication and information (duh). As Bailard points out, this changes the cost-benefit analysis for individuals to FORM political opinions. In essence, it becomes easier to engage in politics because it reduces the cost to do so. Information can be obtained so readily and easy that people can engage and it seems Bailard shows this to be the case. As a result, the SUPPLY of voters/individuals interested in politics, increases. \n\n-   For elites: The internet provides a new platform for people to engage in politics. Prior to the internet, the barrier to become an elite was much more difficult. The internet democratized who can be an elite. Youtube, facebook, etc. provided a space for anyone to become an elite. This increased the SUPPLY of elites (look at Kevin Munger's work). The greater supply of elites introduced greater VARIATION in ideology of the elite class (this is how you get polarization to increase as more and more people are expressing different viewpoints). The increased variation of ideology in the elite class spills over into the information and cues they provide to the masses. Because it is easier to be an elite and share information, the masses now have greater access to the variation in perspectives. In short, there used to be a strong barrier towards becoming an elite, perhaps gated by education, money, network, etc; however, the internet basically allows anyone to become an elite and provide cues to people. \n\n-   There is a greater SUPPLY of informed voters, SUPPLY of elites, SUPPLY of information and that is what might be driving our polarized epoch. \n\n    -   Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\n## [Mishler, William, and Richard Rose. 2001. \"What are the origins of Political Trust? Testing Institutional and Cultural Theories in Post-communist Societies.\" Comparative Political Studies 34(1): 30-62.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MWT6y6eK_oKX_JRIOy0NeksB8TUnRMTc/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\n\"Micro-level institutional arrangements are the source of political trust.\"\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhat is the source of political trust?\n\n### Purpose:\n\nUnderstanding how trust begins is important for the consolidation of new democracies. There are competing explanations for the sources of political trust. Some hypotheses stress exogenous determinants  (these are considered cultural theories) while others stress endogenous determinants (these are considered institutional theories). Both can take micro- and macro-level forms. The authors set out to assess which determinants are stronger.\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\n1.  (National Culture): Trust in political institutions varies between countries rather than among individuals according to historically rooted, national experiences embedded in interpersonal structure.\n\n2.  (Individual socialization): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries according to individuals' trust in others as shaped by their places in the social structure.\n\n3.  (Government performance): Trust in institutions varies across rather than within countries in proportion to the success of government policies and the character of political institutions.\n\n4.  (Individual evaluations): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries in accordance with both individuals attitudes and values and the social and economic positions individuals occupy.\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Strongly support the superiority of **institutional explanations (endogenous)** of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. \n\n-   The effects of **macro-political and economic performance** on trust are indirect and mediated at the micro level by an individual's value-laden perceptions\n\n-   Contrary to cultural theories, **interpersonal trust varies** widely within societies and has little appreciable effect on institutional trust at either the aggregate or individual levels\n\n-   micro-institutional hypothesis (Hypothesis 4) is confirmed, and the other hypotheses (Hypothesis 1 through Hypothesis 3) are rejected.\n\n**Building trust: (p. 56)** Trust can be nurtured by improving the conduct and performance of political institutions. Governments can generate public trust the old-fashioned way: They can earn it by responding promptly and effectively to public priorities, rooting out corrupt practices, and protecting new freedoms (Hetherington, 1998, reaches similar conclusions). Political institutions also can earn trust through economic policies that promise and ultimately provide a better material future for the country as a whole.\n\n### Methods:\n\n-   Data - data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. \n\n    -   Aggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with **survey data** on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. \n\n\\\n\n-   **Survey data** (p. 40) analyzed here come from the fifth New Democracies Barometer (NDB V), organized by the Paul Lazarsfeld Society, Vienna, and the seventh New Russia Barometer (NRB VII), organized by the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde.\n\n    -   NDB interviews were conducted between January 1998 and May 1998 in seven Central and East European countries---Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia---and in two successor states of the former Soviet Union, Belarus and Ukraine. \n\n    -   Professional survey firms conducted face-to-face interviews using national probability samples of approximately 1,000 in each country. \n\n    -   In addition, NRB interviews were conducted in Russia by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion in March 1998 and April 1998 using a multistage national probability sample that yielded 1,904 face-to-face interviews \n\n-   To test the effects of both national context and individual differences\n\n    -   Pooled the survey data from the 10 countries in a single multinational file of **11,499 respondents.**\n\n    -   Each country was weighted equally as **having 1,000 cases**, and a variety of macro-contextual and aggregate performance variables were added to the merged data set so that respondents could be analyzed in terms of both their individual attributes and their national contexts.\n\n-   Institutional trust was measured using the question \"There are many different institutions in the country, for example, the government, courts, police, civil servants. Please show me on this 7-point scale, where 1 represents great distrust and 7 represents trust, how much is your personal trust in each of the following institutions?\"\n\n-   Then were asked \"how much do you trust most people you meet?\"\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   When testing micro theories\n\n    -   **Five proxies for political socialization** are included in the model: age, education, gender, town size, and church attendance.\n\n    -   **Five political performance measures** also are used, including the aggregate index of political corruption and micro-level perceptions of personal freedom, government fairness, political corruption, and government responsiveness to citizen influence.\n\n### Definitions:\n\n-   **Cultural Theories -** view trust as exogenous to political institutions and are a basic character trait learned early in life.\n\n    -   **Micro-Theories -** focus on differences in individual socialization experiences as sources of significant variation in political trust within as well as between societies.\n\n    -   **Macro-Theories -** emphasize the homogenizing tendencies of national traditions and make little allowance for variation in trust among individuals within societies\n\n-   **Institutional Theories -** view trust as endogenous and as a consequence of institutional performance.\n\n    -   **Micro-Theories -** emphasize the aggregate performance of institutions in such matters as promoting growth, governing effectively, and avoiding corruption.\n\n        -   The outputs of institutional trust are assumed to determine individual responses.\n\n    -   **Macro-Theories -** emphasize that individual evaluations of institutional performance are conditioned by individual tastes and experiences\n\n        -   Such as whether a person thinks that political integrity or economic growth is more important and whether that individual personally has experienced the effects of corruption or the benefits of economic growth. \n\n-   **Macro-Theories** - emphasize that trust is a collective or group property broadly shared by all members of a society\n\n-   **Micro-Theories -** hold that trust varies among individuals within a society based on differences in socialization and social background, political and economic experiences, or individual perceptions and evaluations.\n\n-   **Lifetime-Learning Model -** A model that integrates early-life socialization and adult learning, thereby allowing direct empirical comparisons.\n\n### Abstract:\n\nPopular trust in political institutions is vital to democracy, but in post-Communist countries, popular distrust for institutions is widespread, and prospects for generating increased political trust are uncertain given disagreements over its origins. Cultural theories emphasizing exogenous determinants of trust compete with institutional theories emphasizing endogenous influences, and both can be further differentiated into micro and macro variants. Competing hypotheses drawn from these theories are tested using data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Aggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with survey data on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. Results strongly support the superiority of institutional explanations of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. This encourages cautious optimism about the potential for nurturing popular trust in new democratic institutions.\n\n## [Mutz, Diana C., and Byron Reeves. 2005. \"The New Videomalaise: Effects of Televised Incivility on Political Trust.\" American Political Science Review 99 (1):1-15.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vw6A83Zred_EWbHHL_VT8E-kd-15mQ_4/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nRude TV debates depress political trust!\n\n### IV:\n\nIncivility between political opponents on TV\n\n### DV:\n\nTrust in government and politicians\n\n### Research Question:\n\nDoes televised political incivility harm levels of trust in government and politicians?\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nWhen political actors violate interpersonal social norms on television, viewers react as they would if they were witnessing the same interaction in real life; they react negatively to incivility.\n\n### Data:\n\n-   3 survey experiments with pre-test, experiment, and post-test\n\n### Methods:\n\n-   Respondents put into 1 of 3 experimental groups and difference of means test conducted on pre- and post-test survey results after respondents watched fictional TV program of political debate with either civil or uncivil exchange:\n\n    -   Experiment 1 subjects randomly assigned to civil or uncivil conditions (n = 67)\n\n    -   Experiment 2 included a 3rd control condition where subjects didn't watch any political TV (n = 155)\n\n    -   Experiment 3 used within-subjects design where all were assigned to both civil and uncivil conditions in random order to understand process of influence\n\n-   Political trust measured from National Election Studies under rubric of support for the political system\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Hypotheses confirmed! Individuals are negatively impacted by uncivil exchanges on televised political discourse as evidenced by lower trust in government on surveys following exposure.\n\n### Questions:\n\n1.  Mutz and Reeves write that \"when political actors engage in TV interactions that violate the norms for everyday, face-to-face discourse, they reaffirm viewers' sense that politicians cannot be counted on to obey the same norms for social behavior by which ordinary citizens abide\" (2). Does this work in the opposite direction? If politicians began treating each other respectfully on televised debates, would we expect to see an increase in political trust and that would translate into greater political participation?\n\n2.  Related to the question above -- if we assume that academic literature is the dominant civil medium for research-backed discourse, and that this discourse is important for policy change, institutional stability, and informed public participation in politics, how do we amplify its reach?\n\n3.  If this study were repeated today, would the results hold? Do we agree that people expect political actors to act civilly toward each other? And if not, is this partly due to the dwindling approval ratings overall of our politicians and our political institutions?\n\n### General Notes:\n\n-   Television and political trust\n\n    -   Robinson popularized term \"videomalaise\" in 1975 to refer to attitudes that resulted from watching television news\n\n    -   Evidence supporting the causal claim that television is responsible for low levels of political trust has been limited\n\n        -   Claims have broadened into general critique of political journalism\n\n    -   Main emphasis of research has been on the extent to which televised politics heightens the importance of personality characteristics in general evaluations of candidates\n\n        -   Candidates' personal qualities more important to voters who obtained political news from TV (Keeter 1987)\n\n        -   TV primes people to rely more on personality perceptions when evaluating candidates (Druckman 2003)\n\n    -   Social psychology theories of human-media interaction suggest that TV political disagreements would exacerbate the \"intensification of feeling\" Lippmann described in 1925\n\n        -

  People expect political actors who appear on television to abide by the same social norms acknowledged by ordinary Americans\n\n        -   People react negatively to incivility (even if it's on TV)\n\n    -   Experience of political conflict on TV substantially different from real life\n\n        -   Need for politeness is particularly great when expressing controversial views (Kingwell 1995)\n\n        -   Politeness and respect toward individuals involved in a legal conflict enhances their perceptions of fair treatment (Tyler 1990)\n\n    -   Television world provides uniquely intimate perspective on conflicts\n\n        -   When social norms for civility are violated on TV, viewers' intimate perspective intensifies an already negative reaction to incivility\n\n        -   Reeves & Nass (1996) show that when motion appears on TV, physiological responses are the same as when motion occurs in the immediate environment -- the human brain hasn't evolved quickly enough to respond in rational ways to technologies such as TV\n\n    -   When encountering differences of opinion in person, people tend to downplay differences and maintain a polite, cordial atmosphere\n\n        -   In contrast, TV emphasizes conflict and strong differences of opinion to enhance dramatic value and attract viewers\n\n        -   TV is also a highly intimate medium\n\n            -   Central hypothesis: **This violation of social norms should cause negative reactions toward politicians and government**\n\n                -   People expect others to obey social norms and evaluate them less favorably when they don't\n\n                -   Given that the normative expectation is one of civility, this influence should be primarily a function of negative reactions to incivility rather than positive reaction s to civility\n\n                -

  2 versions of each exchange taped\n\n                    -   Candidates expressed exactly same position in same words in both versions, offered same arguments, but civil exchanges were VERY civil and uncivil exchanges took personal jabs, raised voices, and never apologized (as well as rude nonverbal reactions)\n\n        -   Figure 1 shows results: candidates in uncivil versions of issue exchanges consistently perceived as less polite, more quarrelsome, more emotional, agitated, and hostile\n\n            -   2 null findings: no perceived ideological differences in a candidate's stand in civil vs. uncivil condition\n\n-   Procedures\n\n    -

If so, how?\n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\n-   Develops  a theory that accounts for the variety of ways in which pro- and anti- gay-rights actors engage with the media, which generates clear expectations about how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs.\n\n-   The author argues that increased overall media consumption enhances support for LGBTQs, but that this effect is driven by consumption of newspaper, internet and social media. This is because government censorship of queer content is often directed at television programs that contain positive representations of LGBTQs.\n\n-   The media impacts public opinion of the LGBTQ+ community through (1) exposing individuals to positive representation and (2) exposing individuals to new information in general\n\n### Findings:\n\n1.  Different types of media produce distinct effects on public opinions of LGBTQ+ people\n\n    1.  Radio and television have no significant effect on pro-gay attitudes\n\n    2.

Despite extensive research on how the media affects public opinion, including studies that show how exposure to certain information can increase support of LGBTQs, there is virtually no research on how the media influences attitudes towards LGBTQs across Africa. This study develops a theory that accounts for actors' mixed approach to the media and shows how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs. Specifically, the study finds that radio and television have no, or a negative, significant effect on pro-gay attitudes, whereas individuals who consume more newspapers, internet or social media are significantly more likely to support LGBTQs (by approximately 2 to 4 per cent). The author argues that these differential effects are conditional on censorship of queer representation from certain mediums. The analysis confirms that the results are not driven by selection effects, and that the relationship is unique to LGBTQ support but not other social attitudes. The results have important implications, especially given the growing politicization of same-sex relations and changing media consumption habits across Africa.\n\n# Week 14: Electoral Participation\n\n## [Aguilar, Edwin Eloy, and Alexander Pacek. 2000. \"Macroeconomic Conditions, Voter Turnout, and the Working Class/Economically Disadvantaged Party Vote in Developing Countries.\" Comparative Political Studies 33(8): 995-1017.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XoGrm7M5Dd1mhhpwSCQDW3nXFK5syW9C/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nThe lower class mobilizes in developing countries during economic downturns!\n\n### Research Question:\n\nTo what extent and in what manner do fluctuations in voter turnout affect support for parties with working-class/lower status concerns in the developing world?

At the time, people were moving away from RCT, Aldrich argues that it is still useful and can't help us get closer to explaining why some people vote and others do not. \n\n### Goal:\n\nUse rational choice to help us understand why some people vote and others do not. \n\n-   We can find variables that increase or decrease the likelihood of turning out. But they never in an absolute sense tell us above. \n\n### The Basic Model:\n\n-   Preferences determine behavior \n\n    -   Rat choice is about HOW those preferences determine behavior\n\n-   A citizen's preferences are realized in the outcome. We infer a voters preference through the action of who they vote for. \n\n    -   Citizens' preferences are transformed into utilities for outcomes when it matters how much the citizen prefers one outcome over another. \n\n-   Conclusions of basic model: \n\n    -   Never vote for the less preferred candidate\n\n    -   If costs of voting are high, always abstain\n\n    -   If costs of voting are zero, then vote for A because voting for A dominates abstaining \n\n    -   If cost is between 0 and 5, the basic model is silent. Rational choice models of turnout differ over ways to handle these cases. See figure 1.\n\n### Rat Choice:\n\nRational choice theories are theories about the (expected) utility associated with outcomes generates or induces preferences for the particular actions at hand. \n\n-   Fundamental is that rat choice argues that whichever outcome has a higher utility (1,0), the individual will choose actions to receive the higher utility outcome. \n\n-   Actions are instruments to achieve outcomes\n\n-   The action of voting is an instrument to achieve the desired outcome. \n\n### Cost of Voting:\n\n-   Voting is not a costless action. \n\n    -   You have to obtain information, process it, decide what to do. \n\n    -   You have to go to the polls. \n\n-   Some people say that not voting is costless\n\n    -   Aldrich disagrees, rational abstainers must pay cost of deciding to vote or not. \n\n-   Cost of voting is represented as, C\n\n-   C \\> 0 \n\n-   When costs are high -\\> voter turnout decreases\n\n    -   \"When registration laws were passed, poll taxes were raised, or residency requirements were enacted, turnout fell.\n\nVoters must still give some thought to what others might do. That factors into the voters choice to act. \n\n-   If the voter thinks that their candidate will lose considerably, they probably will be less likely to vote. \n\n    -   THE PROBLEM: voters do not know the situation they face.\n\n### The Calculus of Voting Model:\n\n-   Initially developed by Downs and extended by Riker. \n\n    -   Controversial addition to the model. The term D\n\n    -   D represents the value of seeing democracy continue. If noe voted, Downs argued the political system would fail and thus some vote to ensure the continued vitality of democracy.\n\n        -   Riker continues this - change it to \"citizens duty\" \n\n-   Adding a D term is the same as subtracting a C term. \n\n    -   More of a sense of citizen duty can counter the cost of voting. \n\n    -   D does not change anything unless D \\> C. \n\n-   CRITICAL INNOVATION TO CALCULUS OF VOTING MODEL: \n\n    -   Each person assigns a probability of the state of the world being true. \n\n        -   **The probability that one vote will make a difference.**\n\n-   Can be summed up through the equation: \n\n    -   R = PB + D - C\n\n        -   If R is positive, vote for candidate A (voters preferred candidate) if not, abstain.\n\n        -   R = Rewards \n\n        -   P = Probability of one vote breaking a tie \n\n        -   B = difference in utility for candidate A instead of B winning (diff in benefits) \n\n        -   D = citizen duty\n\n        -   C = cost of voting \n\n    -   Higher P = higher voter turnout \n\n    -   C, D, and B are strong predictors of turnout.\n\n-   Problems with the Calculus of Voting model\n\n    -   D term is hotly debated \n\n        -   If you vote because \"you wanted to\" then voting is not instrumental towards an outcome.\n\n            -   Rat choices are models of how one acts, given tastes. They are not models of where \"taste\" comes from. \n\n    -   The P term is not realistic. It is not reasonable to assume your vote will break a tie. \n\n### The Minimax Regret Model\n\n-   Developed by Ferejohn and Fiorina \n\n-   Reject completing the basic model. \n\n    -   They argue people's ability to form probability assessments of the state of the world is basically too difficult and near impossible. \n\n        -   If these probability assessments cannot be formed, they argue that the calculus of the voting model can not be used. \n\n-   Instead of expected utility maximization, they propose a decision rule called minimax regret\n\n    -   Suppose a voter decided to abstain. Their preferred candidate loses by one vote. That voter would be regretful of their decision. \n\n        -   Thus they measure the level of regret \n\n-   Minimax regret refers to taking the action that yields the minimum of these maximum regrets. \n\n    -   This model differs in what to do on the middle columns as seen in figure 1. \n\n-   They argue their model is better than the calculus model and better predicts turnout more often.\n\n-   Problems with the Minimax Regret Model: \n\n    -   P term is still an issue \n\n        -   P at least exist but is small \n\n            -   Honestly this was a bit over my head. See page 259 - was confused. \n\n    -   Second issue is the wasted voting undermines the plausibility of minimax regret \n\n### A Third Approach - Game Theoretic Accounts:\n\n-   Aldrich the other models have problems \n\n-   Tho other models are based on decision theory\n\n    -   No one decision is assumed to affect the decisions of others. \n\n        -   The decisions of others are highly aggregated \n\n-   Game theory models do not make this mistake and assume that decisions are based on taking others' decisions into explicit account. \n\n    -   Wait but aldrich says that problems in the calculus model are still at least somewhat present in game theory models \n\n        -   ????????????????????\n\n### The Rationality of Turnout:\n\n-   Turnout is cheap \n\n-   Information gain is asymmetric \n\n-   Elections differ in salience and impact.\n\n-   Turnout is still a collective action problem BUT not a good example. Collective action problems typically assume importance because they are high-cost, high benefit decisions, where small P terms mean that the high B terms are substantially discounted. Turnout is a low cost, low benefit decision and she's little light on most important collective action problems. \n\n### Strategic Politicians and Rational Choice Turnout:\n\n### A strategic politician explains why turnout is higher in close elections. \n\n-   More investment into close contests and this will be reflected in increasing levels of turnout. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Strategic politicians inform voters of the wasted-vote argument and convince at least some voters that it is sensible to act ast strategic voters \n\n    -   I forget the name but there is a new book out that discusses how and where candidates go to campaign (physically). He basically finds that campaign events don't really do anything other than increase turnout. \n\n## Blais, André. 2009. \"Turnout in Elections.\" OHPB.

It moves from research at the aggregate level, including why there is country level variation in voter turnout and finishes on individual level research review and why people vote.\n\n### IV:\n\nsocio-econ environment, party system, level of development, electoral rules such as compulsory, institutional structure, importance of election/ Resource model, psychological model, mobilization model, rational choice theory/Generational replacement and lowering of age, fractionalization of party system, declining group mobilization \n\n### DV:\n\nWhat accounts for voter turnout variation in the aggregate/individually/why is there a decline starting in the 1990s \n\n### Outcome:\n\n1.  Patterns and Trends: A total of 533 elections and 106 countries are included. All democratic legislative elections (1972-2004), mean turnout 75% and stable with variation in the 3 points range. Variation in country is around 5 points. No central tendency. Turnout decline over time of 8 to 9 points. Higher in established democracies (29 countries) and slightly higher in presidential elections. \n\n2.  Explaining Turnout Variations across Countries: Three sets of factors have been identified: the socioeconomic environment, the institutional set-up, and the party system (Powell 1982; Blais and Dobrzynska 1998). Difference between poor and other countries (undistinguishable amongst the wealthy). Compulsory system affect turnout with a 10-15 points higher turnout (not sure if it is about the sanctions). PR and high magnitude, higher turnout /= in Latin America. Important elections and relative power of the seat at stake=higher turnout/ with a caveat (Blais 2000). Higher leverage of lower house predicts best higher turnout. Facility of voting does not produce measurable findings. Turnout appears to be higher when there are less parties in contention. \"Closeness\" of the results might have an effect. No real consensus on this.\n\n3.  Explaining the Recent Turnout Decline: three reasons for the 9 points decline since 1990 1) Generational replacement, Degree of competition of the election (Franklin). + voting age lowering is not a culprit , 2) Fractionalization in party system, 3)declining group mobilization (especially where union density has subsided). Not completely set\n\n4.  The Decision to Vote or not to Vote: age and education are the two most significant factors, followed by religiosity, income, and marital status (Blais 2000).\n\n## [Franklin, Mark N. 2004.

The idea is that if separated powers are bad for turnout, then anything that accentuates this separation should reduce turnout still further. \n\n    -   Divided government as a variable \n\n-   Turnout in midterm elections is correlated with turnout in the following presidential election more than the association between the previous presidential election. \n\n-   If an elections is felt to be a foregone conclusion, it makes sense less people will vote.\n\nAn inventory of variables affecting electoral competition \n\n-   Executive responsiveness \n\n-   Margin of victory \n\n-   Size of electorate \n\n-   Time since previous election \n\nShort term vs. long term effects\n\n### Chapter 5: **Explaining Turnout Change in Twenty-Two Countries (more substantive chapter)**\n\nThis chapter gets at the main question of: What causes turnout change? Further we can better understand the decline in turnout that has occurred in recent years.\n\n#### Focus:\n\n22 countries 1945 - 1999. ONLY look at lower house election data. Authors do not look at presidential elections or midterms.\n\nFeatures that relate to the utility and costs of voting are the primary motivating forces that drive voter turnout. \n\n-   Other variables include \n\n-   Electoral type \n\n-   Proportionality of electoral system \n\n-   Extent of the franchise \n\n-   Whether absentee ballots are permitted \n\n-   Whether voting is compulsory \n\n-   District magnitude \n\n-   Election over weekend \n\n-   Closeness of race \n\n-   Intervals of election \n\n-   Size of electorate \n\n-   Size of largest party \n\n-   Polarization \n\n-   See page 121 for more.\n\n#### Hypothesis:\n\n1.  We expect Signficnat effects from the following variables operationalized as short-term factors: time since the previous election, weekend voting majority status of the largest party, margin of victory of the largest party, mean margin of victory across the districts in majoritarian systems, polarization and cohesion of the party system, decisiveness of the election, and disproportionality of the electoral system \n\n2.  We expect significant effects from the following variables operationalized as cumulative factors: compulsory voting, absentee voting, female empowerment, extension of the franchise to eighteen year olds, size of electorate, average district magnitude, and the responsiveness of the executive to the political complexion of the legislature \n\n3.  We expect a significant effect of past turnout \n\n4.  We do not expect any features of the character of elections that can vary over time to prove significant except when operationalized as a short-term or cumulative factor. \n\nH1 mainly involves electoral competitiveness, h2 mainly involves process of generational replacement, and h3 involves inertia. \n\n#### Findings:\n\n-   Absentee voting appears to be associated with falling turnout.\n\n-   \"Character of election\" causes significant results on turnout to vary.\n\n-   Female empowerment is signficant \n\n-   Average district magnitude, disproportionality, weekend voting, decisiveness of the political system, polarization of party, proportion of the electorate made up of new voters, whether the government of the day was a coalition were not significant. Their role however maybe subsumed by other variables which may explain why they are not significant. \n\n-   Four variables associated with electoral competition have short term effects \n\n    -   Size of the largest party \n\n    -   Margin of victory \n\n    -   Mean margin of victory (for majoritatarian countries) \n\n    -   Party cohesiveness\n\n-   Four variables having to do with instiutiional arrangements have cumulative effects: compulsory voting, female empowerment, young invitations, and executive responsiveness. And size of electorate \n\n-   Time since last election has effects both on new and and on established cohorts \n\n## [Nickerson, David W. 2008. \"Is Voting Contagious?

The purpose of this article is to more appropriately assess the relationship between collective nostalgia and populism by situating collective nostalgia as a psychological factor that contributes to populism. \n\n### Summary/Theory/Argument:\n\nFollowing the ideational approach, this study claims that populists aim to facilitate the moralistic separation between the pure people (us) and the corrupt elite (them). While constituting the boundaries of us vs. them, populists create an in-group vs. out-group identity. To this end, one of the primary tools that populists utilize is collective nostalgia. Populists offer their constituencies a golden age -- a heartland where corruption, disruptions and enemies do not exist. \n\nElçi situates populism and collective nostalgia in the context of Turkey, where contemporary secularist and Islamic cleavages exist as a product of structures established under the Ottoman Empire. The cleavage exemplifies the ruling center (secularist elites) and the ruled periphery (the Islamic people).  The ruling center adopted Kemalist beliefs - pushing the country to modernize, become secular, and overall promote nationalism. This push was the result of the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990's, leaving a power vacuum in the region that was filled by the Kurds . In response to this, political Islam is aggrandizing the Ottoman past as a tool for the reconstruction of \"**the Great Turkey**\" today. In this way, they are experiencing Ottoman nostalgia - a desire to return to \"the golden days\" and become a leader of the Islamic world.  Ottoman nostalgia is much older than Kemalist nostalgia - which began to emerge in the 1990's following increased pressure by the EU to privatize, as well as increased exposure to the IMF and World bank, which challenged the existing values of the Kemalists. This nostalgia is characterized by 'the memory of a strong, independent, self-sufficient state and its secularist modernization politics which dominated the public sphere through the past century'.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n1.  The more nostalgic respondents are, the more populist attitudes they will express, because nostalgia creates a 'pure people vs. corrupt elites' duality.\n\n2.  Respondents in the nostalgia treatment groups should be more populist than those in the control group in the experimental setting.\n\n3.  The effect of the Ottoman nostalgia treatment on populist attitudes should be greater than the Kemalist nostalgia stimulus in the experimental setting.\n\n### Findings:\n\n-   Collective nostalgia has a significantly positive relationship with populist attitudes even after control for various independent variables - such as religiosity, partisanship, satisfaction with life and Euroscepticism\n\n-   Ottoman nostalgia increases populist attitudes\n\n-   Kemalist nostalgia has a weak direct effect on attitude that disappears when party preference is controlled for\n\n### Method:\n\nUses a representative survey (n=1,954) and experimental datasets\n\n-   the  survey tests the link between individuals' predisposition to nostalgia and populist attitudes (H1)\n\n-   DV:Populist beliefs\n\n    -    constructed from four survey items from previous research that Elçi aggregated into an index ranging from 0 (least agreement) to 100 (most agreement)\n\n-   IV: Nostalgia\n\n    -   Constructed from four different survey items that seek to measure the importance of past values, past experiences, old tastes, and the country's glorious past\n\n-   Controls: \n\n    -   Three sets of IVs to control for the relationship between populism and nostalgia\n\n        -   support for EU membership, satisfaction with democracy, economic conditions, and life, and interpersonal trust questions\n\n        -   Alevi, Kurdish and religiosity, where the cross-cutting cleavages in Turkish society occur.\n\n        -   Partisanship, sex, age, education, income, urban residency. \n\n-   Created 10 different models to control for the effect of nostalgia with party preference and satisfaction with life, democracy, and economic conditions.\n\nAlso performed an experimental analysis\n\n-   created a between-group experimental design in which two groups received different types of nostalgic messages\n\n    -   These were Ottoman and Kemalist\n\n    -   Also used a control group that DID NOT receive any stimulus\n\n-   Data was collected using convenience sampling - respondents were recruited through Facebook and Instagram ads using Qualtrics survey tool\n\n-   N = 911 \n\n    -   Were asked a series of warmup questions - such as satisfaction with democracy, lives, and economic conditions \n\n    -   Randomly assigned them to groups\n\n    -   Introduced experimental vignettes \n\n        -   Ottoman and Kemalist groups were presented with a message priming them to respond to texts about history of Turkey\n\n        -   Control group did not receive any message\n\n-   tested the effect of nostalgia treatments on populist attitudes by building a populism index with five items taken from Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove (2014).\n\n-   summed all items and built a scale between 0 and 100, where 100 indicates higher populist attitudes\n\n### Definitions:\n\n-   **Populism**\n\n    -   **(Mudde, 2007) a thin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into to homogenous and antagonistic groups:**\n\n        -   **the pure people versus the corrupt elite**\n\n-   **Collective Nostalgia**\n\n    -   (Wildschut et al. 2014) the nostalgic reverie that is contingent upon thinking of oneself in terms of a particular social identity or as a member of a particular group and concerns events or objects related to it\n\n-   **Cleavages** \n\n    -   (Somer & McCoy, 2019) formative rifts that 'either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime\n\n### General Notes:\n\n-   Turkey's populist Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) exploits nostalgic rhetoric to dominate the country's politics.\n\n    -   emphasize the glorious days of the Ottoman and Seljukian empires\n\n-   Populists frequently emphasize that the elites hijacked the people's will long ago, and they promise to return power to the people. \n\n    -   According to this logic, back in the good old days corrupt elites were not powerful enough to abuse the authentic people.\n\n-   According to populists, the people's will is the cornerstone of politics \n\n-   Many scholars agree that populism appears as a backlash to a sense of severe crisis (Rooduijn 2014; Taggart 2004) or discontent (Spruyt, Keppens and Van Droogenbroeck 2016). \n\n    -   This sense of extreme crisis paves the way for raising concerns about the present conditions, which is a breeding ground for populism (Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove 2014). \n\n    -   Populists blame the establishment for the decline in the people's economic, political and living standards (Rooduijn, van der Brug and de Lange 2017).\n\n-   Populism can also be generated by unsolved, long-lasting and cross-cutting political cleavages within a society. Somer and McCoy (2019, 8) define these cleavages as formative rifts that 'either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime\n\n-   Nostalgia is a yearning for the past \n\n    -   According to Strauth and Turner (1988) it has four component parts\n\n        -   First, 'there is the view of history as decline and loss, being a departure from some golden age of \"homefulness\"'. \n\n        -   Second,  is the problem that there exists 'a sense of the loss of wholeness and moral certainty'. \n\n            -   At this point, 'history is seen to be a collapse of values which had once provided the unity of social relations and personal experience'. \n\n        -   The third is related to 'the loss of individual autonomy and the collapse of genuine social relationships'. \n\n        -   Last but not least, nostalgia is 'the sense of a loss of simplicity, spontaneity, and authenticity'\n\n    -   Nostalgia, or the way we remember our past, **exacerbates in-group vs. out-group distinctions** (Martinovic et al. 2018). \n\n    -   Nostalgia also **strengthens shared social identity and distinguishes the in-group from other groups** (Brown and Humphreys 2002; Wildschut et al. 2014).\n\n-   The rise of populism is closely related to 'acute despair at the present moment and a memory of a previous golden age'.\n\n-   The golden age corresponds to the heartland in populist literature. \n\n    -   Coined by Taggart (2004, 278), 'the heartland is a construction of the good life derived retrospectively from a romanticized conception of life as it has been lived'. \n\n    -   It involves returning to the pre-lapsarian world, a Golden age before a catastrophic lapse or fall: in the post-lapsarian era, individuals feel lacking, deficient or oppressed (Tannock 1995).\n\n-   In Turkey, secularists and Islamist cleavages exist\n\n    -   The secularists can be thought of as the elites and appear to be supported by the left\n\n        -   they have dominated Turkish politics and society as guardians of the Kemalist values\n\n    -    The Islamist's are the people, representing the ruled and appear to be supported by the right (Çarkoğlu 2012; Çarkoğlu and Hinich 2006).\n\n-   Expectations that impacted Control variable selection: \n\n    -   The author expects that the more dissatisfied respondents are with their lives in general, subjective economic conditions and democracy, the more populist attitudes they will have.\n\n    -   Religiosity plays a pivotal role in explaining the party preferences of the Turkish constituency and is a key independent variable for explaining the center--periphery cleavage.\n\n        -   Therefore expects more religious respondents to display more populist attitudes.\n\n    -   Expect Alevi respondents to have less populist attitudes because they are more supportive of secularism.\n\n    -   Expects that Kurdish respondents will have more populist attitudes because they are more critical of the Kemalist establishment.\n\n    -   The Peoples' Democratic Party (Halkların Demokratik Partisi, HDP), as a radical democratic pro-Kurdish party, should also display more populist attitudes\n\n    -   expect CHP and Nationalist Action Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, MHP) voters to have less populist attitudes since they represent the status quo.\n\n## Fitzgerald, Jennifer. 2018. Close to Home: Local Ties and Voting Radical Right in Europe. Cambridge University Press. Chapters TBD.\n\n**Chapter 1:**\n\n### Research Question:\n\nWhy do people vote for radical right parties? Why do certain people at certain times in certain places decide that a radical right party or candidate merits their electoral support? \n\n### Focus:\n\nEurope, North American, Oceania \n\n-   Mainly Switzerland and France\n\n### Literature insights: \n\n-   Originally, social group based voting was powerful and pervasive. The left had unions and the right had churches; these were stabilizing forces. \n\n    -   However, as membership in unions and churches and their attendant social groups wanes, support for mainstream left and right parties becomes less socially rooted in a traditional sense and less habitual. \n\n        -   Instead of approaching elections from particular social positions, people now make choices at the polls that are motivated by attitudes on specific policy issues and attraction to particular political leaders. \n\nLocalist Theory of Radical Right Voting: an account of unconventional electoral behavior that is motivated by people's feelings of attachment to their local communities \n\n### Main Argument:\n\n\"I argue that those individuals with the strongest sense of belonging to their localities find the programs of radical right parties particularly appealing.\" \n\n-   All politics is local - Tip O'Neill\n\n-   Local attachments underpin and motivate radical right support\n\n### Localism: \n\n-   Small scale communities can offer a sense of belonging and a sense of place; research in psychology bears this out. \n\n-   Globalization has changed things. \n\n    -   As globalism has increased, the importance of the local has grown in response. \n\n    -   \"Modern life has not erased the importance of place...It may have, instead, increased the need for people to draw boundaries, to more crisply define their geographic community...and to behave in ways that signal their place-related identities...People are often proud of where they are from, and they continue to want you to know it. (Cramer 2016: 240, fn. 12) \n\n    -   Globalization pushes people to invest reflexively in their local areas, it also threatens to undermine what makes each locality special. Pg 6 \n\n-   Eric Hobsbawm: The impersonalizing forces of globalization push people to invent mental connections to social groups, thereby reinforcing the rise of identity politics. \n\n### What is the typical right winger?\n\n-   MAN \n\n-   Low socio-economic status \n\n-   Typically holds negative view of modern developments \n\n    -   Immigration, outsiders ruining \"the way it was\" \n\n        -   Trad dudes. \n\n### Interesting insights: \n\n-   High Social Capital negates the typical right winger. \n\n-   \"Straddling the individual-aggregate divide are accounts informed by theorist of social capital; the argument is that individuals who invest in social capital (through the participation in civil society) and those communities rich in social capital will not find the radical right particularly appealing\" (Coffe et al. 2007) \n\n### **\\*\\*\\*Social Capital v. Localism\\*\\*\\***\n\n-   So like if you have good thoughts about your communities you will vote far right but if you're very involved with community you won't\n\n-   Having very positive sentiment toward the locality and the people in it can make the radical right appealing. \n\n-   In contrast, route engagement in community life wards off the appeals of these parties; when people invest their time and energy into participating in civil society and neighborhood life, the radical right is not so enticing an option. \n\n    -   Moreover it is feelings of attachment not the actual routine social interaction that benefits radical right parties. \n\n-   When people avoid routine social and organizational activity, but still feel very positively tied to their local communities, they are powerfully primed to consider radical right programs alluring. \n\n### Findings: \n\n-   I find that today's passion for all things local and localities' enhanced political salience have contributed to the growth of radical right parties. \n\n-   Radical right does best when locality is politically salient. \n\n-   Local tues are most politically relevant when and where the locality has significant authority and autonomy, when and where the locality has recently lost substantial power, and when and where local elections are temporally proximal to national elections.\n\n## Mudde, Cas, and Christóbol Rovira Kaltwasser. 2013. \"Exclusionary vs. Inclusionary Populism: Comparing Contemporary Europe and Latin America.\" Government and Opposition 48(2): 147-174.\n\n**This is not an empirical paper and it's kind of like a case study (sort of).**\n\n### Bumper Sticker:\n\nSubtypes of populism have regional similarities; Latin American populism is generally inclusive in nature while European populism is generally exclusive.\n\n### Data:\n\nBroad patterns of populism with more focused attention on France, Austria, Bolivia, and Venezuela\n\n### General Notes:\n\n-   Rise in interest in studying populism and its relationship with democracy\n\n    -   One key aspect: is populism exclusive, inclusive, or both?\n\n        -   Findings largely regionally determined; LA inclusive while Europe exclusive\n\n        -   Few cross-regional studies\n\n-   To overcome conceptual confusion and regional isolation, this article investigates whether populism is exclusive or inclusive (or both) cross-regionally and by consistently using one definition of populism\n\n    -   4 case studies 1990-2010: Haider and Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), Le Pen and French National Front (FN), Morales and Bolivian Movement for Socialism (MAS), and Chávez and United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV)\n\n    -   3 dimensions of inclusion/exclusion: material, symbolic, and political\n\n        -   2 factors crucial to understanding regional patterns:\n\n1.
