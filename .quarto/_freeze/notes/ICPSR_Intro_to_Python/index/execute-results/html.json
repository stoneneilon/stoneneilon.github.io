This course covers the absolute *basics*.\n\n# Software\n\nGoogle Colab is main software used - **this is the one used during class.**\n\n-   be careful with the google AI that helps you with the code. It's cool but not very accurate as of right now.\n\nOptional: Spyder - Spyder is an IDE that makes it similar to an interface like R studio.\n\nOptional: Jupyter Notebooks\n\nIf you want to work with data that is sensitive or private, do NOT upload it to any cloud service. In this case, use Spyder and download/work with the data locally.\n\n# Day 1 - Introduction and Language Basics\n\nIf I want to download Python locally, talk to a TA.\n\n## Getting to know Python\n\n-   Python is more flexible and general than R.\n-   Object oriented\n    -   R is also object oriented.\n-   R is very similar to Python.\n    -   basic syntax is similar.\n-   Why learn python?\n    -   its the most popular programming language\n\n    -   Python is used a lot by data analyst\n\n        -   text analysis, machine learning, and AI are big on Python.\n\n    -   Web scraping very big on Python\n\n    -   Accessing APIs with Python good as well.\n\n        -   APIs are just a way to access data easily.\n-   General-purpose language. Not a statistical language\n-   Free and open source\n-   User created packages\n-   Steep learning curve\n-   different paths to the \"correct\" answer\n-   Nat Silver apparently does everything in Stata (gross)\n\n## Basic Syntax\n\ncommand(object)\n\nex: print(\"Hello World\")\n\nThere are different types of objects.\n\n-   Objects are assigned with =\n\n    -   in R it is \\<-\n\n-   Objects are defined by type:\n\n    -   scalar (cannot be subdivided)\n\n        -   int - integer, e.g. 3 or 142\n        -   float - real numbers, e.g. 4.2 or -3.5\n        -   bool - Boolean, known as logical in some languages, True or False\n        -   NoneType - a special type with on possible value, none. Basically means NULL.\n\n    -   non-scalar (has an internal structure that can be assessed)\n\n        -   vector, data frame, list.\n\n    -   Can find type in Python with type()\n\n        -   in R it is class()\n\n-   We can convert different types to other types\n\n    -   just be careful!\n\nExpressions = objects + operators\n\n-   akin to taking words and making sentences\n\nWhat are operators?\n\n-   Additions +\n-   Subtraction -\n-   Multiplication \\*\n-   Division /\n-   Modulus %\n-   Exponentiation \\*\\*\n-   Floor division // - rare\n\nPython knows order of operations\n\nExample code chunk:\n\n::: {#4492c672 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# this is an example of assigning an object and adding operators to the objects. \npi = 3.14159\nradius = 5 \narea = pi * radius**2 # pi is an object * another object (radius) raised to the second power\nprint(area)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n78.53975\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can \"rebind\". This assigns a new value to the object of the same name. The object is getting a new value. So be careful when you rebind!\n\n*note*: need to use the print command. In R you could just type the object and it would print. This is not the same in Python.\n\n::: {#0b21bf50 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Rebinding example \npi = 3.14\nradius = 10 \ncircumference = 2 * pi * radius \nprint(circumference)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n62.800000000000004\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEND DAY 1!\n\n# Day 2\n\n## Exercise: Describe how to make coffee in as much detail as possible\n\nTo make coffee I first grab a Keurig coffee cup and put it in my Keurig . Once starting the Keurig , I wait for it to heat up and it begins filling the cup. After, I put my sugar free vanilla creamer inside the the mug. I then mix it up and it is ready to be served.\n\n-   What is the point of this?\n\n    -   Think about how many different tasks you have to go through.\n\n        -   Learning Python is similar. It is a series of small tasks.\n\n            -   we need to spell out each of those tasks that we do without thinking.\n\n                -   they need to be in our code.\n\n                    -   Any big tasks we want Python to do, we need to have it do all those small tasks to make it do that one large task...this is called **control flow.**\n\n## Strings\n\n-   Strings must be in quotes.\n\n-   defined: text, letter, character, space, digits, etc.\n\n-   Use triple quotes for multiple lines of strings.\n\n::: {#4fe59dcd .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ngreeting = \"Hello! How are you\"\nwho = 'Anastasia' \nprint(greeting)\nprint(greeting + who + '?') # this is concatenating. notice the output. \nprint(greeting + \" \" + who + '?') # this is one way to fix the spacing issue\n# we could also add a space to the object. \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHello!

The n_apples is still an integer. \n\nprint(\"I ate\", str( n_apples), \"apples.\") # this is a concatination. We convert the int to a string. \n\n# now try to assign a new object\nsentence=(\"I ate \", n_apples, \"apples.\") \nprint(sentence)\ntype(sentence) # notice the type is not a string. We will discuss tuples later.   \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nI ate 3 apples.\nI ate 3 apples.\n('I ate ', 3, 'apples.')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```\ntuple\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Input\n\nAllows a user to input a response.\n\nExample:\n\n::: {#8f3679c2 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# note this code won't run on this website. But you can copy it somewhere else and it will execute. \ntext = input(\"Tell me somethingâ€¦\")\nprint(\"So you are saying\", text) \n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can go further:\n\n::: {#70eae980 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# this will give you your age. Pretty fun. Note this code will not run on this website. \nbirth_yr = input(\"Type in your birth year:\")\nprint('You are ' + str(2024 - int(birth_yr)) + ' years old.') # if we were to assign this to an object, we would return a string because the middle input is wrapped in a str() function. So it will convert our input which is originally an integer, to a string. \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Boolean\n\n-   Used to compare to variables to one another\n\n-   Used for binary outcomes. True or False?\n\n    -   var1 \\< var2\n\n    -   var1 \\>= var2\n\n    -   var1 \\> var2\n\n    -   var1 \\<= var2\n\n    -   var1 == var2\n\n    -   var1 != var2\n\n-   These will help once we start talking about control flow of a model.\n\n-   Logical operators on Booleans\n\n    -   **not, or , and** are special words for logical operators\n\n    -   **not a**\n\n    -   **a or b**\n\n    -   **a and b**\n\n-   Examples:\n\n\n    ::: {#4dcce563 .cell execution_count=8}\n    ``` {.python .cell-code}\n    hours = 20 \n    # more than a day   \n    print(hours>24) # this will return FALSE.
