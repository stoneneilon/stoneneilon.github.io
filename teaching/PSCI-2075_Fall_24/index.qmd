# Welcome!

## Please Read First:

-   This page is my own personal recitation website. I will post both course material and anything we go over in recitation. This is simply a central hub that you can use to help you throughout the semester.

-   **This does not replace the lecture, canvas, or your notes.**

-   In previous years, I have used slide shows. This website is an effort to have a more organized and central workflow that is more accessible.

-   I teach the 017 and 018 recitation. Make sure you are in the right section!

    -   Section 17 meets on Th 10:10am-11:01am [Bruce Curtis Bldg E158](http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap/map.html?bldg=MCOL)

    -   Section 18 meets on Th 1:25pm-2:15pm [Clare Small Arts and Sciences 104](http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap/map.html?bldg=CLRE)

        -   FYI Clare is an old building with no AC. It gets very stuffy and hot. Try your best to stay cool (bring a cold drink and dress accordingly)!

# Week 1

## Syllabus:

[Click here for syllabus.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HxbI-1JMdPEEj65F-0_tfS5ajdC064e6/view?usp=sharing)

## Required Texts:

-   Pollock, Philip H. and Barry C. Edwards. 2020. *The Essentials of Political Analysis.* 6th Edition. CQ Press. (EPA)

-   Pollock, Philip H. and Barry C. Edwards. 2023. *An R Companion to Political Analysis.* 3^rd^ Edition. CQ Press. (RCPA)

## Computer:

This class requires the use of a computer. **Not an iPad!** You are expected to bring it to lecture and recitation regularly.

If you do not have a computer, the library should have some available for you to rent.

## Software:

Much of this class revolves around the statistical software known as "R". R is free and open source. It is widely used in academia and industry. We will discuss how to install R soon.

## Contact:

The only way to reach me is by email. I try my best to be as responsive as possible. You may email me at any time of the day but please understand it may take up to 48 hours for me to respond.

Email: stone.neilon\@colorado.edu

## Office Hours:

My office hours will occur every Tuesday from 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM. If you are unable to meet at that time, please email me to schedule a time that works for you.

My office is Ketchum 382. The office is called the American Politics Research Lab (APRL).

## Recitation Grade:

Per the syllabus, recitation is 15% of your overall grade. Attendance accounts for 10%. Participation in recitation accounts for 5%. Showing up to class and participating is important to succeed in this class.

## Attendance Policy:

Attendance and participation is part of your grade. Per the instructions of the professor, you are allowed to miss **ONE** class before it starts to count against your grade. You do **NOT** have to email me if you will be missing class. There is no excused or unexcused absence. You simply get one "freebe" to miss class. If you have a valid reason for missing multiple classes, please inform me as soon as possible so we can coordinate the appropriate response together. Subsequent absences after your "freebe" will result in a -10% penalty to your recitation grade. *This will also impact your participation grade as you cannot participate if you are not in class.*

## Coding/Math Concerns:

Some of you might have chosen to pursue a social science degree simply because you thought it would have less math. Unfortunately for you, math is not going anywhere and you need it to be successful in your career. The purpose of statistics is to use data we have, to tell us about data we do not have. This course will provide you just enough to be *dangerous*.

If you have never coded before or have very little experience with computer concepts, **do not fear**. In many ways, you may find coding in R to be frustrating and foreign. *This is normal.* I want to stress that this material is not something you can memorize like history facts. Programmers typically talk about coding as *languages.* Languages require practice. R will take practice. You will have errors in your code and you will get confused. I will do my best to help you understand how to read and write code using R. Additionally, there is a plethora of information online. Websites such as Stack Exchange, YouTube, Reddit, and other forums probably have solutions to issues you might encounter. I use them all the time, even for trivial stuff.

Remember that both the Professor and I have office hours to help you, if needed. We are here to help you, so please do not be scared or intimidated to come talk to us, *it's our job*. You may also schedule additional help with the department's Methods Lab Coordinator (these are grad students that have previously TAed this course):

-   Samantha Register - samantha.register\@colorado.edu

    -   Consult this [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qDDT5cY4xklJ1lPe4Z5eam-M5lLVtlbG/view?usp=sharing) for more information on the Methods Lab Coordinator

## Recitation Expectations:

I want to make sure you do well in the class. I do my best to make recitation fun, accessible, and meaningful. We will be using computers regularly, I cannot and will not monitor your use during recitation. You are adults and I trust that you are following along. So please do not be texting your friends; shopping on Alo or Aritzia - those pilates socks will be there after class, I promise; playing video games; or listening to music with your very obvious, not discrete, airpod in your left ear. [Also, please laugh at my jokes.](https://youtu.be/OUXvrWeQU0g?si=kHYyOOlWi9uo9kZ4&t=21)

## Group Work:

There will be group work in this class. Please consult the syllabus for more details. I will decide how groups are broken up. I will randomly assign new groups for each homework. The rationale behind random assignment is to better encourage community and engagement within the classroom. I still talk to people I met in my undergraduate classes to this day. I found the more I engaged with others, the better I did. Don't be shy!

Group work can sometimes lead to uneven work load amounts. **You are expected to contribute evenly in groups**. In the event you find individual(s) not pulling their weight, I will consult with the individual(s) to determine if their grade should be evaluated separately from the group. Additionally, the individual(s) participation and homework grade may suffer. Please email me if any issues or concerns arise within groups. I will find a proper solution and consult Professor Beard if needed.

## Week 1 Lecture Information: 

-   How do we know stuff?

    -   Theory + evidence

    -   Theory: comprehensive explanation for some phenomena.

    -   Developing a theory requires an expectation about a relationship between things.

        -   parachutes increase air resistance

        -   more air resistance means slower fall

        -   slower fall means less acceleration on landing

        -   less acceleration means less chance of injury

    -   We can test theory in multiple ways

    -   With parachutes:

        -   lots of experiments with air resistance

        -   lots of observations about how falls cause injury.

-   Basically, statistics needs theory to reach substantive inference.
