# Welcome!

## Please Read First:

-   This page is my own personal recitation website. I will post both course material and anything we go over in recitation. This is simply a central hub that you can use to help you throughout the semester.

-   **This does not replace the lecture, canvas, or your notes.**

-   In previous years, I have used slide shows. This website is an effort to have a more organized and central workflow that is more accessible.

# Week 1

## Required Texts:

-   Pollock, Philip H. and Barry C. Edwards. 2020. *The Essentials of Political Analysis.* 6th Edition. CQ Press. (EPA)

-   Pollock, Philip H. and Barry C. Edwards. 2023. *An R Companion to Political Analysis.* 3^rd^ Edition. CQ Press. (RCPA)

## Computer:

This class requires the use of a computer. **Not an iPad!** You are expected to bring it to lecture and recitation regularly.

If you do not have a computer, the library should have some available for you to rent.

## Software:

Much of this class revolves around the statistical software known as "R". R is free and open source. It is widely used in academia and industry. We will discuss how to install R soon.
