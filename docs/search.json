Unfortunately for you, math is not going anywhere and you need it to be successful in your career. The purpose of statistics is to use data we have, to tell us about data we do not have. This course will provide you just enough to be dangerous.\nIf you have never coded before or have very little experience with computer concepts, do not fear. In many ways, you may find coding in R to be frustrating and foreign. This is normal. I want to stress that this material is not something you can memorize like history facts. Programmers typically talk about coding as languages. Languages require practice. R will take practice. You will have errors in your code and you will get confused. I will do my best to help you understand how to read and write code using R. Additionally, there is a plethora of information online. Websites such as Stack Exchange, YouTube, Reddit, and other forums probably have solutions to issues you might encounter. I use them all the time, even for trivial stuff.\nRemember that both the Professor and I have office hours to help you, if needed. We are here to help you, so please do not be scared or intimidated to come talk to us, it’s our job. You may also schedule additional help with the department’s Methods Lab Coordinator (these are grad students that have previously TAed this course):\n\nSamantha Register - samantha.register@colorado.edu\n\nConsult this document for more information on the Methods Lab Coordinator"

It is important to add comments so that you can remember what the code actually does.\n\n“#” allows you to comment your code. You can type anything after the # and R studio will not execute that code (it basically skips over it).

    "text": "R Basics:\n\nFunctions:\n\nFunctions perform a defined sequence of actions. Functions are like verbs, we are telling R to take some object (noun) and do something with it.\nThere are literally a million functions. You do not need to memorize them.\n\n\nx &lt;- c(2,3,6,8,21,2,67,8) # create a numerical vector and call it \"x\" \nsum(x) # sum() is the function. \n\n[1] 117\n\nrange(x) # range() is another function. Look at the repsective outputs\n\n[1]  2 67\n\n\n\n\nArguments:\n\nArguments are the parameters of the function\nThe functions above are rather simple but what happens when we have functions that we need to specify a bit more?\n\nwe give the function arguments.\n\n\n\nx &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 2)\nx\n\n [1]  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\n# create a sequence of numbers starting at value 2, going until 20 and count by 2. Then assign it as an object \"x\". \n\nThe code above articulates what an argument is. I am telling the function how I want it to be executed.\n\ny &lt;- seq(10, 100, 5)\ny\n\n [1]  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90  95 100\n\n# note that you don't need to specify from, to, and by. The order is predetermined. Although it is good convention so you can better read what your code is doing. \n\nBut Stone, how do we know what the arguments for the function are?! Good question! Every function has different arguments. The “help” section in the output/file pane will help you here. Go to that section and type in the search bar the name of your function. It will provide that arguments for you. You can also type “?seq” into the console and it will automatically take you to the help file for that function.\n\n\nTypes of objects:\n\nObject: R’s way of storing data in its memory, comparable to containers for physical things. Everything that exists in R is an object.\n\nHow do we create an object?\n\nIn R, we use “&lt;-”\n\nTry creating an object in your Source pane. What happens?\n\n\n\n\nKnowing your object type/class is important. What if we have a bunch of numbers that are strings and we want to add them. We can’t do that because R is treating them as characters and not numbers! There are ways to change the object type. I will introduce that concept at a later point. For now, just familiarize yourself with the object types.\n\nString\n\nanything in between ” “.\n\nx &lt;- \"1, 2, 3, 4\"\ny &lt;- \"yee-haw\"\nz &lt;- \"1 one, 2 two, 3 three, (&gt;_&lt;) - words + symbols...anything between the quotes is a string.\"\nx\n\n[1] \"1, 2, 3, 4\"\n\ny\n\n[1] \"yee-haw\"\n\nz\n\n[1] \"1 one, 2 two, 3 three, (&gt;_&lt;) - words + symbols...anything between the quotes is a string.\"\n\n\n\nNumeric\n\nThese are your integers (and floats - fancy way to say numbers with decimals)\n\nnum_example &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6.2,3.141592654)\nnum_example\n\n[1] 1.000000 2.000000 3.000000 4.000000 5.000000 6.200000 3.141593\n\n\n\nFactor\n\nUsed to categorize data\nnot super intuitive - their use will become clearer overtime.\nMaybe this code will help understand\n\nx &lt;- c(\"Dog\", \"Dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Cat\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\")\nx # this will just print out a character vector. \n\n[1] \"Dog\" \"Dog\" \"Dog\" \"Cat\" \"Cat\" \"Cat\" \"Dog\"\n\nas.factor(x) #now we tell R to change this from a character vector to a factor vector\n\n[1] Dog Dog Dog Cat Cat Cat Dog\nLevels: Cat Dog\n\n\nSee how it gave you different “levels”. We have now created two categories.\n\nthis is again may be a little fuzzy but it will get clearer over time.\n\n\nVector\n\nThink of a vector as a column or row.\nI’ve already created a few vectors in previous examples. Can you tell me how I did that?\n\nArray\n\nDon’t worry about this right now.\n\nMatrix\n\nDon’t worry about this right now.\n\n\n\n\nLibraries:\nR has “base” functions. Think of this in car terms, you buy a standard version and it comes with the basics. But now you want to go offroading and you need bigger tires. So, you go out and upgrade your stock car and buy bigger tires. Libraries are the same thing. Stock R might not have what we need, so we add a library that gives us new capabilities. There are libraries that you will almost always use. We will discuss what they are and what they do.\n\nPopular libraries:\n\nTidyverse - this the one you will almost always use. It is a big library with a bunch of other smaller libraries within it.\nHaven - this will help with importing data.\nForeign - another library used to import data.\nStargazer - Makes pretty tables.\nRCPA3 - Textbook library.\nThere are so many more but these will be the ones you probably see the most.\n\n\n\nInstalling libraries:\n\nYou only have to install them once.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\") # run this code and you will have installed tidyverse. You will never need to run this code again. \n\nJust because you have it installed does not mean R will automatically recognize it. You need to call it up or “invoke” its use. Generally, you just do this at the top of your script.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nCongrats! You now have the functionality of tidyverse within your R session.\n\n\n\n\nSaving:\n\nWhen you are done in R studio. You need to save your work and organize it appropriately.\nName the file 2024-09-05_R_Lab_1\nWhether you are on PC or Mac, go to File &gt; Save As &gt; Desktop &gt; PSCI_2075\n\nyour file is now stored in the folder we created earlier.\n\nNow close out of R completely (click no. Clicking yes is a bad habit that is clunky and uses a lot of memory for your computer)\nReopen R by clicking the file you just saved in the folder.\nAfter you initially save, a simple save after you are done will suffice. (Command S is the shortcut for Mac, Ctrl S is the shortcut for PC)"

    "text": "Dealing With Different Types of Objects:\nLast week we discussed the different types of objects in R. I introduced the following object types: factor, numeric, and character (aka string).\nWhen you get into the data, it may be coded ‘weird’. Example, you may see numbers but you can’t do anything with them, why? Because they may be coded as character values! So we need to check using the class() function.\n\na &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5) # create a numeric vector\nclass(a) # tell me what type of object 'a' is\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\nb &lt;- c(\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\") # create a character vector\nclass(b) # tell me what type of object 'b' is \n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nWhat if I want to change the object ‘b’ to numeric? We can do that using the as.numeric() function.\n\nb &lt;- as.numeric(b) # take the object 'b' and treat it as a numeric object then reassign it to b which 'write over it'. \nclass(b) # tell me what type of object 'b' is\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nThe point of this exercise is because sometimes you may be trying to do something with a variable and it may not be working. You need to know your data. How is R reading it? R obviously can’t add character values, so it may give you an error. Checking the object type will help you understand how to treat it and what to do."

Its purpose is to grab specific pieces of information from a dataframe.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame( # create a data frame with the variables, age, income, taxes, sex.\n  age = c(25, 30, 35, 40),\n  income = c(50000, 60000, 75000, 90000),\n  taxes = c(5000, 10000, 15000, 20000),\n  sex = c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\"))\n\ndf.income &lt;- df$income #grab the income column/variable and create a new object. \n\nNotice what happens when we use the ‘$’. The selector is a powerful tool that you will use. We will often need to change our data. The ‘$’ allows us to access the sections of our data that we want.\nThe selector ($) can also be used to manipulate variables within our data frame. Let’s continue using the data frame above to show how this works.\n\n# I want to add a new variable (race) to my dataframe. \ndf$race &lt;- c(\"White\", \"Asian\", \"Black\", \"Hispanic\")\ndf # Notice how we have a new column/variable\n\n  age income taxes    sex     race\n1  25  50000  5000   Male    White\n2  30  60000 10000 Female    Asian\n3  35  75000 15000   Male    Black\n4  40  90000 20000 Female Hispanic\n\n\nLet’s keep going.

Let’s go over what this all means.\n\nVariance is a measure of SPREAD.\nThe average of the squared differences from the Mean. \nLet’s walk through the formula step by step:\n\nThe \\(\\Sigma\\) means to sum all the values together.\n\\((x_i - \\bar{x})\\)\n\nin this part we are taking each observation and subtracting it by the mean (average).\nNow lets add the square term. \\((x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\)\n\nWhy do we square this?\n\nImagine a number line from 0 to 100. We have some dataset where the mean is 50. Now let’s say one of our observations is 38. 38-50 = -12. See what happens!? We have a negative number. All observations to the left of our mean are negative while all observations to the right of our mean are positive.\n\nWhen we add these all up without the square term, we get ZERO!\n\nThus we square to accommodate for these canceling out.\n\nThere are other reasons we square but they aren’t relevant here and this is the main reason.\n\n\n\nNow the \\(n-1\\)\n\nN represents the number of observations.\n\nWhy are we subtracting it by 1?\n\nIf we were calculating the population variance, then we wouldn’t subtract by 1. However, we are pretty much never working with the population. We are always using some samples. \nThis part is not super intuitive. BUT, we are using the sample mean, NOT the population mean to calculate the variance.\n\nWe don’t know what the “true” population mean is. We have an estimate of it using our sample. Thus, there is some uncertainty around the sample mean (we don’t know if the sample mean is = to the population mean). To account for this uncertainty we add a -1 to our denominator. \n\nBy subtracting 1 from the denominator this makes the spread a little larger to account for that uncertainty. Think about what happens when we make our denominator smaller compared to if we don’t. Example:\n\n\\(\\frac{16}{4-1}\\) vs. \\(\\frac{16}{4}\\)\n\nthe one with the \\(4-1\\) denominator will have a larger output and thus account for the uncertainty in our measurement."

This is due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal as the sample size increases, with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.

By specifing the null hypothesis we can invoke the central limit theorem.\nP-values help us determine how statistically significant our relationship is. Remember that we are using data we have to tell us about data we do not have.\n\n\n\nUses:\nThe p-value is decided by the researcher. Convention typically sets the p-value at .10 and below. However, .10 is still not ideal, the lower the better.\n\n\nImportant Notes:\nthe p-value does not tell us anything substantive. It simply tells us if something is statistically significant."

Solving for beta in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) requires us to find a line of best fit that minimizes the unexplained difference (the error). \nTo do this we take the sum of the squared residuals  \n\nIt may help to understand this through the formula of the residual. \n\nFirst the residual is the amount our actual observed value differs from the predicted value (This is in matrix notation). \n\n\\((y-\\textbf{X}\\beta_0)\\)\n\ny is our observed value and the \\(\\textbf{X}\\beta_0\\) is our predicted value (the line of best fit). \n\nWE SQUARE THIS!

It is matrix notation that allows us to multiply these two matrices (vectors). \nWhy do we square? \n\nWe square the residuals for a bunch of reasons.

Remember, we do not know the Beta. \n\nWe set to zero to find the critical point (the minimum) \nTaking the partial derivative with respect to beta, you’re essentially finding the point where the error function is not changing with respect to changes in beta. Where the slope of the error function with respect to beta is zero. \n\nFigure b is a visual representation of what this looks like when we set our minimum.

Specifically whether our model has autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity. \n\nThis is basically what the omega matrix looks like. This photo however is what we want that omega matrix to look like (ours won’t always look like that). But we want the off diagonals to be zero (or effectively zero) and we want the main diagonal to be constant. \n\nIf off-diagonal values are &gt; 0 \n\nWe have autocorrelation\n\nIf main-diagonal values are not the same at each value\n\nWe have heteroskedasticity. \n\n\nNOTE: our omega matrix will NEVER be perfectly spherical.\n\n\n\nConversation with Andy about Omega Matrix:\nI emailed Andy about this and figured it might be beneficial to include it here.\nStone:\nI am looking back on your “Roll your own standard errors.r”. I see how the residual maker is part of the variance formula.\n# the formula for s^2 is e’e/(n-K)\ns.2 &lt;- (t(e)%*%e)/(length(y) - ncol(X))\n##I ran this code individually and it gave me a scalar. I assume this is the sum of the squared error (SSE)?\nAndy:\nYes, divided by degrees of freedom, so it’s a variance\nStone:\nSo, autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity manifest through the variance. Then: vcv &lt;- s.2*(solve(t(X)%*%X))\n\nThis is our VCV of the X’s and then we take the square root of the diagonal to get our SE.\n\nWe use the omega (and the assumptions of no spherical errors) to derive the equation for the SE (equation above). However, if we have spherical disturbances and use the same equation to derive our standard errors then our standard errors are wrong.\nAndy:\nYes,if there are non-spherical disturbances than our standard VCV above isn’t technically correct anymore b/c the equation doesn’t simplify to that.\nStone:\nThen the omega matrix (and its assumptions) is related to the population error. And thus, when we get a sample with spherical disturbances that does not match our expectations of the population error of no spherical disturbances, we then must fix it. Right?\nAndy:\nRight…we can’t know what the population Omega is, but we can get a good guess based off our sample Omega matrix\nStone:\nSo, if we switch the order, e%*%t(e) gives us the matrix of errors (WHICH IS NOT THE OMEGA MATRIX(?)). We want our matrix of errors to look like the omega matrix. It never will but we use the various tests to figure out the level of spherical errors that are present in this matrix.\nAndy:\nThe matrix of the errors IS the Omega matrix, which is the variance covariance matrix of the errors (note the other VCV for our X’s above). It’ll never be spherical perfectly but our assumptions are about expectations so it just needs to be consistently a problem (e.g., 2 errors can be correlated, but it’s only a problem if on average there’s a correlation between errors)\nStone:\nThen when we detect spherical disturbances, we purge it or do whatever (FGLS, Robust/cluster SE), which then fixes our variance and then fixes our SE? Do I have all this right? This all feels kind of magical.\nAndy:\nIf you’re running FGLS you’re using the info in the residual Omega to adjust both your SE’s and coefficients. If you’re correcting just your SEs you’re basically adjusting the standard SE formula to account for the pattern you want to correct for."

This is because these values are squared, so we can’t really tell based on the number alone whether the value is relatively high or low.\nUnderstanding variance is critical in statistics. Variance is integral to the efficiency of our estimators. That is, how accurate our model is."

    "text": "Instrumental variables, what are they? Will I use them? Should I use them?\nInstrumental variables are somewhat rare and frowned upon (?) in political science. To be a good instrumental variable, instrumental variables must satisfy two conditions:\n\nThe instrumental variable is theoretically relevant to x.\nThe instrumental variable must satisfy the exclusion restriction.\n\nThe first point requires that our instrument (z) must be endogenous to our independent variable (x)\nThe exclusion restriction is typically where instrumental variables get attacked. The instrumental variable (z in this case) must only affect X. Z-&gt; X -&gt; Y. The difficulty to this condition is that there is no statistical test. The exclusion restriction must be defended by theory.\nIt is very difficult to find an instrument that is both related to X and does not affect Y. An example of a good instrument is provided below (thank you ChrisP from StackExchange):\n“For example, suppose we want to estimate the effect of police (𝑥) on crime (𝑦) in a cross-section of cities. One issue is that places with lots of crime will hire more police. We therefore seek an instrument 𝑧𝑧 that is correlated with the size of the police force, but unrelated to crime.\nOne possible 𝑧 is number of firefighters. The assumptions are that cities with lots of firefighters also have large police forces (relevance) and that firefighters do not affect crime (exclusion). Relevance can be checked with the reduced form regressions, but whether firefighters also affect crime is something to be argued for. Theoretically, they do not and are therefore a valid instrument.”\n\nWhy should we use an instrumental variable?\nThe need for an instrumental variable arises when we are concerned for confounding variables or measurement error."

    "text": "Parametric vs. Non-Parametric models\nOur goal is to use data to estimate f(x) (this is the line or true relationship). We want to find a function \\(\\hat{f}\\) such that \\(Y\\approx \\hat{f}(\\textbf{X})\\) for any observation (X, Y). So how do we estimate f(X) (the line/relationship)? We can use either a parametric or non-parametric approach/model. Up until now, I have only been taught parametric (this being linear regression, etc.).\nSo which is better, parametric or non-parametric? The answer is simple: the parametric approach will outperform the non-parametric approach if the parametric form that has been selected is close to the true form of \\(f\\).\n\nParametric Methods\n\nWe make an assumption about the functional form, or shape of f (the function/line). Usually this assumption is that \\(f\\) is linear.\nWe then need to fit or train the model. This means we need to estimate the parameters (\\(\\beta_1,\\beta_2,...,\\beta_p\\)).\n\nthe most common approach and the one we have been trained extensively is ordinary least squares (OLS).\n\nOLS is one of the many possible ways to fit the linear model\n\nWe use OLS because when the assumptions are met, it is BLUE.\n\n\n\nOne potential downside of a parametric approach is that the model we choose will usually not match the true unknown form of \\(f\\).\n\nwe want to be careful about over-fitting the data.\n\nthis means they follow the errors, or noise, too closely.\nthis is bad because your model will struggle to estimate responses on new observations that were not part of the original training data set.\n\n\nMaybe the true relationship has some curvature (it isn’t linear) but the linear model we create gets us reasonably close to describing the relationship between the X and Y variables.\n\n\n\nNon-Parametric Methods\n\nWe do not make assumptions about the functional form of \\(f\\).\n\nnon-parametric approaches estimate \\(f\\) as close to the data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly\n\nlower residuals\n\n\nOne major disadvantage of non-parametric approaches is that a lot more observations are needed to get an accurate estimate for \\(f\\).\nYou can still over fit a non parametric model.\n\n\n\nPrediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn obvious question that follows is: Why would we ever chose a more restrictive method instead of a very flexible approach? Wouldn’t more flexibility get us closer to the true \\(f\\)?\n\nrestrictive models are easier to interpret\n\nthe relationship is straightforward and easy to understand!\nOLS is not only really good (it is the best when assumptions are met) but it is super easy to interpret.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervised versus Unsupervised Learning\n\nSupervised\n\nPretty much all the models I have used thus far (and listed prior) use supervised learning.\n\neach observation of the predictor measurement has an associated response measurement for \\(x_i\\) there is an associated \\(y_i\\) value.\n\nGoal: prediction and inference (both involve modeling the relationship between predictors and outcome of interest)\nThe goal of supervised learning is to learn a predictive model that maps features of the data (e.g. house size, location, floor type, …) to an output (e.g. house price). If the output is categorical, the task is called classification, and if it is numerical, it is called regression.\n\n\n\nUnsupervised\n\nMore challenging\nnot focused on in this workshop.\nGoal: search for simple structure underlying data set (what are the relationships between variables)\nYou have a bunch of dependent variables and you think there is some cause underlying them.

The challenge lies in finding a method for which both the variance and the squared bias are low.\n\n\nVariance\n\nVariance refers to the amount by which \\(\\hat{f}\\) would change if we estimated it using a different training data set.\n\nremember that we are trying to estimate \\(f\\) using our sample.

    "text": "Fowler, Anthony, et al. 2023. “Moderates,” American Political Science Review.\n\nAbstract:\nModerates are often overlooked in contemporary research on American voters. Many scholars who have examined moderates argue that these individuals are only classified as such due to a lack of political sophistication or conflicted views across issues. We develop a method to distinguish three ways an individual might be classified as moderate: having genuinely moderate views across issues, being inattentive to politics or political surveys, or holding views poorly summarized by a single liberal–conservative dimension. We find that a single ideological dimension accurately describes most, but not all, Americans’ policy views. Using the classifications from our model, we demonstrate that moderates and those whose views are not well explained by a single dimension are especially consequential for electoral selection and accountability. These results suggest a need for renewed attention to the middle of the American political spectrum.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nModerates need to be classified better and deserve more focus\n\n\nResearch Question:\nHow can we better identify moderates?\nWhy (from a survey perspective) are people moderate?\n\n\nBackground:\n\nWe typically think of moderates in the following:\n\npolitically unsophisticated\nuninformed\npolitically incoherent\nsecretly partisan\nideologically cross pressured\nextreme, with patterns of attitudes poorly by a single ideological dimension\n\nThere are obvious survey issues in trying to figure out if someone is a moderate.\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nSort classically identified moderates into three subgroups of moderate type:\n\nthose who have genuinely centrist views that are well summarized by a single underlying ideological dimension (spatial)\n\nDownsian voters\n\nlive in single dimension.\n\n\\(Pr(y=1) = F(\\beta_j(x_i-\\alpha_j)\\)\n\n\\(x_i\\) is the ideological position\n\\(\\alpha_j\\) is issue\n\n\nthose who are inattentive to politics or the survey (unsophisticated)\n\nrandom/incoherent views. The way in which they select answers has no coherence and basically makes no sense.\n\nspecial stats here but basically if they are showing to have a .5 probability for selecting either survey response question - that is essentially random and they are probably an inattentive voter.\n\n\nthose who hold genuine views that are not well summarized by a single ideological dimension (someone whose preferences are neither unsophisticated nor well summarized by the spatial model and, second, an ideology score on the liberal–conservative dimension were the respondent to be a spatial type (#1 above).)\n\nConversian respondents (named after Philip Converse)\n\ngenuine position holders but not well described in a left-right orientation.\nvoters that care about specific stuff -&gt; which might translate into a lack of a wide-ranging belief system.\nThey discriminate between thus if \\(\\neq\\) .5 relative likelihood then they are probably a conversian moderate.\n\nissue by issue responses not correlated with each other. Less than .5\nnot completely guessing but no complete structure.\n\nno clear structure.\n\n\n\nAssumes responses are perfect representations of preferences\n\nThe issues have been ordered such that if a Downsian gives a conservative answer on issue one, he or she will necessarily give a conservative answer on issues two and three, and so on such that the three questions divide Downsians at three points along the ideological spectrum.\nQuestions are also ordered by popularity.\n\nthis ordering and assumptions allows them to figure out who is a “downsian” voter\n\nif they conflict with the Guttman scale - that is probably not a downsian voter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nCooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)\n\nAll CCES survey data from 2012 - 2018\n280k respondents\n\nAlso use another CCES Model\n\n2010\nasked 133 policy questions to 1,300 people.\n\nif the question was ordered they turned it into a binary scale.\n\nthey wanted all questions to be binary.\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nModerates are more attentive to elections (than liberals and conservatives)\n\nmore responsive to incumbency\nmore responsive to candidate experience\nmore responsive to ideologies\n\nMost moderates appear to be Downsian\nresults suggest centrist voters drive the relative success of incumbents, centrists, and experienced candidates.\nFind 6.5% of CCES respondents are inattentive\n\nThis is a bit weird to me… Not sure how to say it.

    "text": "Mehlhaff, Isaac, et al. 2024. “Where Motivated Reasoning Withers and Looms Large: Fear and Partisan Reactions to the COVID-19 Pandemic,” American Journal of Political Science.\n\nAbstract:\nContemporary American politics has been largely characterized by hyper partisanship and polarization, with partisan-motivated reasoning a thematic concern. Theories of emotions in politics suggest that anxiety might interrupt partisan heuristics and encourage citizens to reason more evenhandedly—but in what domains and to what extent? We use original panel data to assess how anxiety about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 interacted with partisan attachments to shape political judgment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The structure of our data allows us to assess large-scale implications of politically relevant emotions in ways that so far have not been possible. We find large effects on policy attitudes: Republicans who were afraid of getting sick rejected signals from copartisan leaders by supporting mask mandates and the like. Effects on vote choice for Republicans were muted in comparison, but fear’s large effect on independents may have been pivotal.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nFear and anxiety can influence partisanship (a little)\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhy, then, did so many Republicans prefer policies starkly different from those suggested by their leaders but so few vote against those leaders?\nHow did the anxiety of COVID-19 influence partisan politics?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nPartisanship influences how people see, act, and listen.\nAnxiety can influence both information gathering and information processing.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented opportunity to test the posited link between anxiety and interruption of partisan habits.\nPartisans typically listen to party elites.\n\nbut for many republicans during Covid-19, they disagreed with the party elites.\n\nAccuracy Driven Reasoning: a processing style in which people exert more effort to reach correct conclusions. They “attend to relevant information more carefully,” “process it more deeply,” and “[consider] more alternatives”\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nFearful individuals will be more supportive of pandemic mitigation policies such as mask mandates.\nFearful individuals’ accuracy motivations to be visible in the information they consult\n\nthey should seek more information, including from sources they do not habitually use.\n\nFear to be associated with a greater likelihood of voting for Joe Biden\n\nwhy Biden? - because covid-19 mitigation information was more often endorsed by Biden.\n\nFearful Republicans should move further toward support for mitigation policies simply because their attitudes have more room to change in that direction.\n\n\n\nData:\n\nQualtrics survey in April 2020\n\nw/ follow up interviews in June, September, and October.\n\nExamine support for five pandemic related policies:\n\nmask mandates\nstay at home orders\nbusiness lockdowns\nmonitor of public spaces by police\nmandatory covid-19 testing\n\nThen assessed the influence of anxiety on information search and knowledge about Covid-19.\nThen evaluated how anxiety altered approval rates of Trump and the CDC.\nFinally, wave 4 is used to examine who the respondent will vote for in the election.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nAnxiety about real-world events can decouple partisans’ policy positions from those of their party leaders. Once citizens enter the voting booth, however, their ability to assess accountability and mete out electoral reward or punishment remains deeply affected by partisanship even under pandemic conditions.\nfear of getting sick with COVID-19 can lead citizens to adopt policy positions contrary to party cues.\nthe results suggest that anxiety does encourage individuals to pursue accuracy-motivated reasoning, even on a highly politicized issue\nanxiety encourages individuals to seek out new information, to eschew habitual elite cues, and process what they learn with the goal of achieving accuracy, rather than rationalizing partisan talking points.\nAt the lowest levels of fear, respondents’ vote intentions were strongly associated with their party identification.\nFear increases people to check different news sources.\nAs fear increased, probability to vote Trump decreases.\n\neffect is not as much as the effect of fear on policy preferences (mask mandates, etc.)\n\nIndependents were more affected by fear.\nfear of severe illness did little to attenuate the effect of partisanship on vote choice.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI don’t like the way it discusses elite cues.\n\nthere were so many cues from everywhere all at once.\nThere is also a potential lag going on between cues and individual.\n\nVery similar to the Charlie Hebdo article we read in comparative."

An increased emphasis on social identities has important political implications, including for polarization and representation. We first document the rising salience of different social identities using natural language processing tools to analyze all tweets from 19 media outlets (2008–2021) alongside 553,078 URLs shared on Facebook. We then examine one potential mechanism: Outlets may highlight meaningful social identities—race/ethnicity, gender, religion, or partisanship—to attract readers through various social and psychological pathways. We find that identity cues are associated with increases in some forms of engagement on social media. To probe causality, we analyze 3,828 randomized headline experiments conducted via Upworthy. Headlines mentioning racial/ethnic identities generated more engagement than headlines that did not, with suggestive evidence for other identities. Identity-oriented media coverage is growing and rooted partly in audience demand.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nMore engagement/demand with articles that include identities in headlines.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nHave social identities become more prominent in the political information environment?\nDo the same stories generate more engagement when framed with identity-oriented language?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nMedia coverage of social identities has grown in recent decades as outlets adopt identity-oriented coverage strategies (production of identity-oriented content)\nOn social media, news content referencing core social identities is especially likely to generate engagement (audience level reaction to content)\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nVoters may make different voting decisions when the salience of key issues changes\n\nWhat explains changes in salience?\n\nA major argument says the media.\n\n\nThe media may be devoting more coverage to identity driven media coverage\n\nhowever, we don’t know if that is true\n\npuzzle!\n\n\nMechanism of focus: audience demand\nReal time data metrics and a highly fragmented and competitive media market is in part what has led to changes in media coverage.\nEconomic incentives for media companies to publish this content because it gains more engagement.\nTheory: reliance on audience metrics has increased identity-oriented media.\nWhy do social identity coverage generate audience engagement?\n\nSocial identities serve as filters in a complex information environment, helping individuals identify relevant and actionable information.\nsocial identities often serve as a foundation for coordination and collective action\nsocial identity cues help individuals understand the applicable group norms in specific contexts\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nAll tweets from 19 American media outlets (2008-2021; n = 6,235,014)\nMedia outlet URLs shared by Facebook users (2017-2020; n = 553,078)\nNews website Upworthy assigned different headlines to different people of similar stories (2013-2015)\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nPosts with identity-related content have higher levels of expressive and social engagement (measured via liking and sharing) than those without it.\nDifferent outlets are shown to invoke different identities more frequently than others.\nSince 2007, mentions of racial and partisan identities on Twitter have roughly tripled.\nPartisan identities appear in a large proportion of Facebook posts, and the prevalence of other identities in news URLs posted on Facebook is roughly 2–5 percentage points higher, depending on the identity category\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThis is an interesting article\nI think it fits nicely with other supply/demand explanations of media\n\nsee Kevin Munger"

We propose a new measure of a member’s legislative effectiveness that covers both chambers from 1873 to 2010 and incorporates all 1.1 million introduced bills, opening up a wide range of new opportunities for examining legislative institutions and behavior across this long historical period. To pursue this, we theorize and empirically examine how the determinants of a member’s legislative effectiveness hinge on legislative institutions. While uncovering consistent results with the existing literature that has focused on the period starting in the early 1970s, we find striking differences when examining earlier periods. For instance, we find that ideological moderates have higher effectiveness relative to extremists before 1975, whereas the importance of majority-party membership increases dramatically from 1947.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nWe made a new legislative efficiency score that tells us stuff about political history.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nWhat does it mean to be an effective lawmaker?\n\n“The proven ability to advance a member’s agenda items through the legislative process and into law” (Volden & Wiseman 2014)\n\nlooking at structural institutions to see how it changes efficiency.\nThey are creating a new way to measure members’ legislative efficiency\nPrimarily focused on role of committee chairs, majority parties, and ideological distance to chamber medians.\nRule changes + organizational changes separate the legislative eras.\n\nwhat institutional factors caused variation in efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\n\n\nWhich factors the authors expect will have the most impact on legislative efficiency in different eras.\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nCreate a member-level measure of effectiveness by considering the totality of bills that are introduced into Congress within a term.\n1873-2010\nCreate bill level measure to weigh importance of a bill.\n1.1 million bills\nlook at bill progress + importance. - measure of bill salience.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nBetween the 1890s and 1946, we find that ideological extremism harms a members legislative effectiveness.\nAfter 1947, we find clear advantages for majority party members.\nthe effect of ideological distance on legislative effectiveness disappears from the mid 1970s, coinciding with the increasingly pronounced roles of political parties and committee chairs.\nWe also find that committee chairs tend to have higher effectiveness, with the effect being largest during the Textbook Congress in the House while staying stable in the Senate.\nSeparate 1873-2010 into four regimes:\n\nEarly (1873-1888)\nPre-War (1889-1946)\nTextbook Congress (1947-1974)\nPost-Reform (1975-2010)"

Public Perceptions of Court Approval and Legitimacy in a Post-Dobbs World,” Science.\n\nAbstract:\nHave perceptions of the U.S. Supreme Court polarized, much like the rest of American politics? Because of the Court’s unique role, for many years, it remained one of the few institutions respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But the Court’s dramatic shift to the right in recent years—highlighted by its Dobbs decision in 2022—potentially upends that logic. Using both eight waves of panel data and 18 nationally representative surveys spanning two decades, we show that while there was little evidence of partisan polarization in earlier years, in 2022 and 2023, such patterns are clear in favorability, trust, legitimacy, and support for reform.

Ch. 4.\n\nPartisan Choice - Chapter 4.\n\nThe motivational role of perceptions of the wider political environment deserves greater attention.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nLevels of attitudes impact vote choice.\n\n\nMain Hypothesis:\n\nThe voting act depends in an immediate sense on the individual voter’s evaluative orientations towards several objects of politics ought to be tested by an examination of the influence of all these orientations at once.\nHow do people decide which candidate to vote for\n\n\n\nPsychological forces on behavior:\n\nVoting is the resultant of attitudinal forces.\nvoters have orientations to the elements of politics\n\nelements include the president, domestic + foreign policy, performance of parties in gov., personal attributes p.67\n\nthese are evaluated and subsequently shape the orientation as either positive or negative.\n\nthese combined make up a system of partisan attitudes.\n\n\nbasically like approval ratings for stuff.\n\n\n\n\nPartisan Attitude and Voting Choice:\n\nThe psychological measures strongly affect the partisan vote.\nMore favorable attitude of Eisenhower = higher % of republicans voted for him\nLess favorable attitude of Eisenhower = Lower % of republicans voted for him.\ndata is a small n.\nNote this is just one attitude dimension that does not explain the voting act\n\nauthors argue the partisan choice is based on a system of partisan attitudes.\n\nAttitude towards Eisenhower at the extreme ends predicts vote choice pretty well. However, those that are more neutral in their attitude towards Eisenhower (regardless of party affiliation) does not predict vote choice well.\n\nAuthors need more dimensions to explain vote choice as attitude toward Eisenhower is not enough.\n\nThese graphs are awful.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nEvidence for their hypothesis is supported from their sample\n\n\n\nResults of their model in predictive power of vote.\n\n\nAlso looked at the error rate and why it existed.\n\ndid some qualitative work through interviews\n\n“Our interviews suggest that the dynamics of these face-to-face associations are capable of generating forces that may negate the force of the individual’s own evaluations of the elements of politics.” p.76\n\n“…For example, one respondent traced an abrupt reversal of his vote intention to the arrival of a brother-in–law from California; another to the pressures he felt from work associates; another to face-to-face badgering by a precinct committeeman.” p.76\n\nSeeing a bit of social capital/Gerber, green, Lerimer, in here\n\n\n\n\nAlso showing early signs/evidence of partisan sorting among an individuals network.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of Attitude Conflict:\n\nCampaign is important for them as it increases political salience.\nThis section seems to ask to what degree does a campaign influence the individuals vote decision.\nThey ask when an individual’s vote decision crystallized.\n\nmajority knew before campaign\n\n2nd most knew after who candidate was.\n\nThose that knew earliest had the highest joint relation of those 6 attitudes tested earlier.\n\nthe decision time of who to vote correlates with a decline in 6 attitudinal relationship.\n\nINTERESTING! - the people that are latest to decide have the lowest correlation in the 6 attitudes tested.\n\nmight these be moderates? Might this explain why candidates start turning to the middle during the general election? Might this be why there is so much focus on the undecided voters?\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion deciding late always is greater as the degree of attitude conflict is greater; at any attitude level.\npersons in the sample who decided late had the highest amount of attitudes in conflict.\nLater voter has less enthusiasm about candidate.\n\nmore likely to split ticket.\n\n“In our data from several presidential election campaigns it is clear that persons who show some degree of conflict of partisan attitude are less likely to be interested in the campaign than those whos attitudes are fully consistent, and they are less likely to care how the election turns out.” p.85\n\nthis seems to be different from the Fowler et. al reading from earlier.\nbring this up to Josh."

No formal definition but seem to be an actors preferences.\n\nidea elements vary in centrality.\n\nthis refers to the importance of the idea element within the belief system.\n\nthese can change over time. Generally thought that “ends” are supposed to be more central than “means”.\n\n\n\nBelief systems have ranges\n\nthe scope of objects that are referents for ideas and attitudes in the system.\n\nfocus will be on belief systems with wide ranges and some degree of centrality.\n\n\navoid using ideology because it gets confusing cause like Marx talks about ideology.\n\n\n\n\nSources of constraint on idea-elements:\n\nLogical Sources of Constraint:\n\ngovernment revenues, government expenditures, and budget balance are three idea-elements that suggest some purely logical constraints.\n\nthese positions are contradictory.\n\nhowever, this still does not ensure subjective constraints will be felt by the actor.\n\n\nhypothesis 1) logical inconsistencies would be far more prevalent in a broad public.\nconstraints among idea-elements visible at an elite level is mirrored by the same lines of constraint in the belief system of their less visible “supporters.”\n\nthey believes this to be incorrect.\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Sources of Constraint:\n\nFew belief systems depend on logical constraints.\nLogical contradictions in belief system\n\nIMPORTANTLY: elites familiar with the totality of the belief system recognize the logically constrained cluster of ideas.\n\nThere are like mega ideas(?), postures, values that make up prime centrality\n\nsocial darwinism, social change, natural law, the nature of social justice\n\nKinda quasi-logic, things that feel like they should go together.\n\n\n\n\nSocial Sources of Constraint:\n\nFirst source of social constraint:\n\nIn the case of the belief system, arguments are developed to lend some more positive rationale to the fact of constraint: The idea-elements go together not simply because both are in the interest of the person holding a particular status but for more abstract and quasi-logical reasons developed from a coherent world view as well. It is this type of constraint that is closest to the classic meaning of the term “ideology.”\nGroup identity, social influence, political party*.\n\n\n\nSecond source of social constraint:\n\nShaping a belief system into something that is credible to large portions of the population can only be done by some minuscule portion of the population.\nidea elements of a belief system are diffused in “packages”.\n\n(“If you believe this, then you will also believe that, for it follows in such-and-such ways”).\n\nInformation must be successfully transmitted.\ntrickling of information is largely due to differences in education\n\nbut also modified by differences in specialized interest and tastes that individuals have acquired over time.\n\n\n\n\nActive Use of Ideological Dimensions of Judgement:\n\nSeems to be describing the role of information shortcuts.\ngreater constraint a system of multiple elements - the easier it can be packaged and understood.\nUses ‘yardsticks’ as the term to describe this.\nHierarchy of respondents:\n\nIdeologue: top level - people who had some abstraction conceptualization\n\nsmallest group\nknow what terms mean and use them accurately.\n\nSemi-ideologue: second level - mentioned a dimension but did not seem to grasp fully the dimension/concepts\n\nsecond smallest\n\nGroup Interest - Third level - failed to rely upon any such over-arching dimensions yet evaluated parties and candidates in terms of their expected favorable or unfavorable treatment of different social groupings in the population.\n\nLargest\n\nsome variation in sophistication at this level\nless interest in politics.\nWhy aren’t they considered ideologues?\n\nthey are kinda described as “followers”\n\n\nThink about social groups\nCues from social groups.\n\nNature of the Times: Fourth level - residual category - respondents that invoked some policy considerations in their evaluations yet employed none of the references meriting location in any of the first three levels.\n\nnature of the times voters\nIssue reference was a single narrow policy for which they felt personal gratitude or indignation toward a party or candidate.

He also discovered the very insecure position of truth in the world, for from “opinions comes persuasion and not from truth” (Phaedrus 260). The most striking difference between ancient and modern sophists is that the ancients were satisfied with a passing victory of the argument at the expense of truth, whereas the moderns want a more lasting victory at the expense of reality. In other words, one destroyed the dignity of human thought whereas the others destroy the dignity of human action. The old manipulators of logic were the concern of the philosopher, whereas the modern manipulators of facts stand in the way of the historian. For history itself is destroyed, and its comprehensibility —based upon the fact that it is enacted by men and therefore can be understood by men—is in danger, whenever facts are no longer held to be part and parcel of the past and present world, and are misused to prove this or that opinion. p.9 Origins of totalitarianism\n\n\n“The people on the hill don’t do what they might like to do, they do what they think they have to do in their own interest as they see it.”\nPresident has to persuade congressmen that what he wants is in the best interest of them.\npresident has a lot of soft power - anyone will pick up the phone if he calls.\nPresident has the ability to grease wheels.\npresident power is subtle.\nbut of course the president is still powerful."

The principle of majority rule is a logical necessity.\n\nfor the court to act in this way is to affirm that the court ought to act in a way to deny popular sovereingty and political equality ought to prevail in this counry.\n\n\n\nHow do we even know what the population thinks? What is the majority?\n\npre mass polling\nuses congress + president as the barometer of “majority” opinion.\n\nJustices are appointed by presidents - who don’t usually appoint hostile justices!\n\npolicy views of the court are never far out of line with the lawmaking majorities of the United States (this is obviously a bit outdated as we see differently today).\n\nLawmaking majorities generally have their way.\nThe court can delay the application of policy for a long time\n\nRight of Justice\n\nbasic premise: a country that respects the rights of man or believes in it, the court should defend these rights against a lawmaking majority.\n\nbut the justices are appointed by the lawmaking majority\n\nare their beliefs ever that far out of line with them?\n\ndo we really think they would go against them?\n\ndoesn’t look that good:\n\nslave owners over slavery\nwhite people over black people\nproperty owners at the expense of wage earners\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the court flagrantly opposes the major policies of the dominant alliance\n\nlegitimacy goes down.\n\nCourt is least effective against a current law making majority and least inclined to act.\nNot majority or minority rule but minorities rule.\nthe Court operates to confer legitimacy, not simply on the particular and parochial policies of the dominant political alliance, but upon the basic patterns of behavior required for the operation of a democracy.\nThe main objective of presidential leadership is to build a stable and dominant aggregation of minorities with a high probability of winning the presidency and one or both houses of Congress. The main task of the Court is to confer legitimacy on the fundamental policies of the successful coalition.\n\nthis is really important to me!\n\nBig takeaway: court does not have the power to stand against strong majorities."

These are issues outlined by Zaller related to how people think about and are influenced.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nPolitical elites - persons who devote themselves full time to some aspect of politics or public affairs\n\npoliticians, higher-level government officials, journalists, some activists, and many kinds of experts and policy specialists.\nFrames of Reference - news stereotypes\n\nParty Conversion Thesis - Mass polarization occurred because of party loyal reshuffling\n\nliberals moved to democrat (in the context of 1960s race stuff)\nconservatives moved to republican (in the context of 1960s race stuff)\n\n***Opinion Leadership Thesis - Mass polarization occurred because of opinion conversion.\n\nDemocrats became more liberal\nRepublicans became more conservative\nThis is the one Zaller will focus on.\n\n“Information carried in elite discourse about politics” - refers to the stereotypes, frames of reference, and elite leadership cues that enable citizens to form conceptions\n\nand opinions about events beyond their full understanding.\n\nPolitical awareness - the extent to which an individual pays attention to politics and understands what he or she has encountered.\n\nheavy emphasis is placed on the ability to understand - the absorption of political communication.\n\nPolitical predispositions - stable, individual-level traits that regulate the acceptance or non-acceptance of the political communications the person receives.\n\npredispositions are gained during development/life.

Media distorts and has biases.\n\nit is also very simple.\n\ndespite people saying that the media is too simple, they do not like when it is more extensive and in-depth; “it’s harder to follow”.\n\n\nNew stereotypes are created and influence how we see things.\nFrames and stereotypes help inform the public\n\nwhich determines how people take sides on political issues\n\nfor events/news that are both observed and unobserved\n\n\nDoes the public have any choice in news stereotypes?\n\nif they don’t have choice, the public can do little more than follow the elite consensus on what should be done. p.8 (2nd chap)\n\nthis seems like a supply argument. The more elites -&gt; greater options for the public.\n\n\nMost attentive members of the public are most likely to adopt elite pov on the matter.\n\nwhen elites divide, the public tends to split down partisan lines with the elite closest to them.\nAlmost dipping into a little of Foucault with discussion of academia perpetuating racists knowledge.\n\nShift in mass attitudes correlates with a shift in elite attitudes.\nBetter educated were more likely to adopt elite opinions because they followed them more\nIf elite cues can change opinions on race - it can change anything.\nFocus is on the Opinion Leadership thesis.\nElites on Elite opinion changes (?)\n\nsee discussion of Newsweek and defense spending\n\nPeople vary in political awareness\noverall levels of information are low\nPolitical awareness is associated with increased exposure to current communications that might change one’s opinion, but it is also associated with heightened capacity to react critically to new information.\n\npolitical awareness and mass opinion is the biggest contribution of the book according to Zaller.\n\n*** Elites are NOT assumed to have an important role in shaping predispositions ***\n\nPredispositions mediate people’s responses to elite information in the manner just indicated, but predispositions are not in the short run influenced by elites.\n\nMaybe there is an effect but book doesn’t deal with it.\n\n\nI feel there is lots of overlap with Converse and Campbell in regards to political awareness.\nFirst, one should, whenever possible, use appropriate domain-specific measures of political values, rather than a general measure of ideology, as the operational measure of citizens’ predispositions to accept or reject the political communications they receive. The reason is that ideology, as the more general measure of people’s left-right tendencies, is more likely to miss reactions to a particular issue than is an indicator that has been tailored to that issue.\n\n\n\nWhat is an Opinion?\n“The interview situation is an odd social experience. The respondent, on his doorstep or in his living room, is barraged with a set of questions on a wide variety of subjects by a stranger, usually a rather well-educated woman over 30, who carefully notes each response on a sheet of paper. Few people are accustomed to having their every utterance faithfully recorded and many find the experience flattering. And, aware that their views are being preserved for the ages, they do not wish to appear unprepared at that moment. Under these circumstances it is not surprising to find respondents pontificating in a seemingly authoritative, if basically”truthful,” manner on subjects about which they know nothing or to which they have never given any thought whatsoever. . . . (p. 1)”\n\nZaller takes this quote and runs with it basically. The book is trying to make sense of the phenomenon described above.\n\n\n\nProblems with Mass Opinion Reports\n\novertime instability\n\nbasically there is a lot of random error and we need to focus on this according to Zaller.\n\nResponse effects\n\nsurvey questions content and order can prime responses.\n\nQuestion wording effects\n\nthe content of the question can radically change how people respond to reporting their opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nZaller’s Model:\n\nI abandon the conventional but implausible view that citizens typically possess “true attitudes” on every issue about which a pollster may happen to inquire, and instead propose a model of how individuals construct opinion reports in response to the particular stimuli that confront them.\n\nThis model unites in one theory an account of how people acquire information about politics, as sketched in the first part of this chapter, with an account of how they use that information to formulate responses to typical survey items.\n\nPeople are continuously exposed to a stream of political news and information, much of it valenced so as to push public opinion in one direction or the other. But, owing to the generally low levels of attention to politics in this country, most people on most issues are relatively uncritical about the ideas the internalize. In consequence, they fill up their minds with large stores of only partially consistent ideas, arguments, and considerations. When asked a survey question, they call to mind as many of these ideas as are immediately accessible in memory and use them to make choices among the options offered to them. But they make these choices in great haste - typically on the basis of the one or perhaps two considerations that happen to be at the “top of the head” at the moment of response. p.36 chapter 2\nThe basic claim of the model, thus, is that survey responses are a function of immediately accessible “considerations,” where the flow of information in elite discourse determines which considerations are salient. The reason for response instability, on this view, is that different considerations happen to be salient at different times, which causes people’s survey responses to differ over repeated interviews. Changes in question order or question wording can bring about systematic changes in the considerations immediately salient to people, and hence systematic changes in their survey responses.\n\n\n\nChapter 3: How citizens acquire information and convert it into public opinion\n\nAim(s)\n\nHow citizens learn about matters that are for the most part beyond their immediate experience\nHow citizens convert the information they acquire into opinions.\nHow do people acquire information from the political environment and transform that information into survey responses?\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\nConsideration - any reason that might induce an individual to decide a political issue one way or the other.\n\na belief concerning an object and an evaluation of the belief.\n\nPersuasive messages - arguments or images providing a reason for taking a position or pov.\n\nif accepted by an individual, they become considerations.\n\nCueing messages - second type of message carried in elite discourse, consist of “contextual information” about the ideological or partisan implications of a persuasive message.\n\n\n\nThe Model - Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) Model\nHow individuals respond to political information they may encounter - comprises of 4 axioms.\n\nReception Axiom - The greater a person’s level of cognitive engagement with an issue, the more likely he or she is to be exposed to and comprehend - in a word, to receive - political messages concerning that issue.\n\nspecifying the reception axiom in terms of cognitive engagement.\npolitical attentiveness, political awareness, cognitive engagement = all the same thing. = COMPREHENSION! Political awareness = comprehension = are you watching and understanding.\n\nmeasures a person’s summary score across a series of neutral, factual tests of public affairs knowledge\n\nmeasure of general, chronic, awareness.\n\n\nA1 claims that reception of politically relevant communications, whatever their origin, is positively associated with intellectual engagement with a given issue.\n\nnot central to the model but Zaller assumes much of the information received is from elite discourse but cant empirically test this.\n\n\nResistance Axiom - People tend to resist arguments that are inconsistent with their political predispositions, but they do so only to the extent that they possess the contextual information necessary to perceive a relationship between the message and their predispositions.\n\nkey here is the information concerning the relationship between argument and predisposition\n\nthe probability of an individual acquiring cueing information depends on their level of awareness.\n\nLow attentive individuals seem to pay more attention to the credibility of source\n\nsusceptible to authority position.\n\nPolitical awareness should be associated with resistance to persuasion BUT\n\nthis only applies to cases in which the contextual information necessary to evaluate an issue in light of one’s predispositions is, for one reason or another, obscure.\n\nthe more abstract the link between a predisposition and a related policy issue, the greater the amount or obscurity of knowledge necessary to perceive the linkage, or the more complicated the chain of reasoning involved, the more important political awareness is likely to be in regulating individual responses to political communication on that issue.\n\nAccessibility Axiom - The more recently a consideration has been called to mind or thought about, the less time it takes to retrieve that consideration or related consideration from memory and bring them to the top of the head for use.\n\nvery much getting into what is going on cognitively.\nThe brain has to do stuff - people are not computers!\n\nResponse Axiom - Individuals answer survey questions by averaging across the considerations that are immediately salient or accessible to them.\n\npeople respond to survey questions based on what is “at the top of their head”\n\nthey do not canvas their mind.\n\n\nOpinion statements, as conceived in my four-axiom model, are the outcome of a process in which people receive new information, decide whether to accept it, and then sample at the moment of answering questions.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4:\n\nZaller starts looking at NES data.\nHe finds respondents are giving different answers for the same question at different intervals.\nPeople possess numerous, frequently inconsistent “considerations” relating to each issue, and that they base their survey responses on whichever of them are at the top of the head at the moment of response.\n\npolitical attentiveness is going to influence the attitudes reported by an individual.\n\nNES Survey Pilot\n\ntwo phone interviews at two different times w/same respondents.\nTrying to understand what considerations were important in determining respondents’ answers.\n\nIMPORTANT: First wave, the interviewer gave the respondent time - they were not required to respond right away\nsecond wave, a response was asked immediately.\n\n\nRAS model is a set of claims about how citizens acquire “information” and convert it into attitude statements, which is to say, it is a type of information-processing model.\n\nattitude statements on particular issues depends on the amount and direction of info available to the public of each issue.\n\n\n\nAssumptions of RAS Model:\n\nModerately intense, temporally stable information flows favoring both the liberal and the conservative side of each issue\n\na competitive media environment between repub and dems.\n\nexcludes huge issues like the Iran-Contra.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeductions:\n\nAmbivalence Deduction\n\nFrom A2, we know that individuals can reliably resist the arguments to which they are exposed only to the extent that they possess “information” about the implications of the hose arguments for their predispositions\n\nmost Americans do not rate very highly on political awareness.\n\nCitizens will be unlikely to exhibit high levels of resistance to arguments that are inconsistent with their values, interests, or other predispositions.\n\nenvironment evenly balanced on communication - people are likely to internalize many contradictory arguments. Hold both favorable and opposing considerations on the issue at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nD2\n\na person discussing the liberal side more will probably take the liberal side. vice versa\n\nD3\n\nif people form conflicting considerations on most issues, and if they base their survey responses on whichever of these considerations happen to be at the top of the head at the moment of response, one should expect a fair amount of variability in people’s responses to survey questions.\n\nD4\n\nif people are exposed to a shifting balance of liberal and conservative communications, the balance of considerations in their minds will shift in the direction of the more recent communications, and this will bring about systematic attitude change.\n\nbut if the flow of communciations remains steady, the balance of positive and negative considerations in each person’s mind should be, on average for each given issue, roughly the same at one point in time as at another.\n\nwe should expect to find a fair amount of purely chance variation around a stable central tendency.\n\nso long as the flow of information in the political environment remains steady.\n\nlong term score may be 5 but might fluctuate between 3 and 7 over repeated interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\nD5\n\nmore politically aware persons will exhibit less chance variability in their survey responses.\n\nbetter informed persons are more likely to possess the cueing information necessary to reject communications inconsistent with their values\n\nTested by 7 point scale anchored by the two polar positions. In a final stage, they were asked to indicate the position of several prominent political figures or groups on this scale, including Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Michael Dukakis…etc, and political parties.\n\nD6\n\nThis will make it more likely that they will form considerations are homogeneously consistent with their values.\n\ntested through a measure of ideological consistency at the level of considerations.\n\n\nD7\n\nand this homogeneity will lead, inter alia, to greater response stability over time.\n\nD8\n\nattitude stability should be weaker for issues on which partisan divisions are hazy or nonexistent, because in such cases the public gets few message cues.\n\nD9\n\nWhen the degree of public attentiveness to an issue is generally high, it follows that attitude statements on this issue will, in the public as a whole, exhibit less variability, all else equal, than will attitude statements on more remote or abstract issue.\n\nD10\n\nIndividuals who care more strongly about issues, will pay more attention to issues and hence exhibit less chance variability in their attitude statements about these issues.\n\nD11\n\nPeople’s responses to particular questions may, for the reasons just given, vary stochastically around their equilibrium points, but the equilibrium points themselves should remain constant as long as the environment remains stable.\n\nover the long run.\n\n\nD12\n\nPeople’s open-ended remarks are associated with changes in the direction of their close-ended remarks.\n\nD13\n\npeople who mention an equal number of opposing considerations should be more stable only as often as could be expected by chance alone, which is 50% of the time."

This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being “motivated-skepticals” when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e. spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of “partisan processing” that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:\nH1: there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs\nH2: there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments\nH3: there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones\nThese combined will results in:\nH4: attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments\nWhich is conditional upon:\nH5: the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism\nH6: and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nTwo experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control\nThe participants (Ps) were recruited from introductory political science courses at Stony Brook University\nStudy 1: N=126\nStudy 2: N=136\nFirst Part: Confirmation Bias\nThe participants (Ps) were seated at computers and their political attitudes were assessed through the evaluation of a series of contemporary political issues aimed at activating their priors - this was done through random assignment into either condition 1 or condition 2 (see figure 1)\nThey rated the items on a series of scales to assess attitude strength (0-100) and attitude position (like-dislike; 9 item scale)\nThey then viewed information on an information board, where they could seek out hidden policy arguments by known source alone (see figure 2); the amount of time they spend engaging in each argument was recorded by the software.\nThey viewed eight arguments without a time limit, but could only view each argument ONCE\nThey then completed the same attitude battery from the beginning of the experiment before filing out demographic information and a political knowledge scale ( to assess sophistication)\nSecond Part: Disconfirmation Bias\nadministered the battery again, but with the conditions (issues) swapped.\nthen asked to rank the strength of 8 arguments (4 pro and 4 con)\nthen there was a post test battery AGAIN and a recognition memory test\nthey were also asked to list their thoughts regarding two pro and two con arguments they were presented with Arguments were taken from online sources and edited such that they were similar in complexity and length.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nstrong evidence of a prior attitude effect (H1) such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments.\nParticipants counter-argued the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias (H2) - this was supported by the participants spending MORE time on the policy arguments that they disagreed with\nAlso find a confirmation bias (H3)—the seeking out of confirmatory evidence—when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read - this was supported by the participants seeking out information in the matrix that they agreed with\nBoth the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization (H4) —the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes—especially among those with the strongest priors (H5) and highest levels of political sophistication (H6)."

Page 90 attempts to provide answers for the following questions posited on page 89: 1) Do environmental forces also influence personality?; 2) is it not the case that people’s personalities change, and does this not imply a role for influences other than biology?; and 3) irrespective of other non biological effects, can political behavior alter and individual’s personality?\nIn regards to question 1, the authors do support the connection between environmental factors and personality; however, they argue it is only manifested during huge “shocks” in the physical environment to cause this change. They use the example of Chinese students changing personality after moving to Canada. I do not contend that biological factors account for most of the variation in personality, BUT I disagree with the strength they assign the environment on personality.\nI believe they are understating the role of environmental factors as their premise lies upon a study of college aged students. A more powerful argument would use young individuals as the subject of focus. But again here lies an issue, the power of environmental factors in shaping personality is more pronounced at a younger age, diminishing over time. Personality like politics is a socialization process. However, we cannot know this because this narrow question requires a counterfactual that simply not possible. To fully evaluate this claim we would need to study an individual from the time they are born to adulthood, raised in different contexts…maybe a twin study could accomplish this?\nFor question 2, the authors do admit that personality changes over time, especially in their adolescence, but they argue this change does not signify a “noteworthy impact of environmental influences.” Citing Costa and McCrae (1988), the changes are minuscule, further, citing a different article from Costa and McCrae (2006), biological influences account for changes in personality across life cycles. I DO NOT BUY THIS.\n“As teenagers mature toward adulthood, they consistently exhibit a tendency to become more agreeable and less neurotic. These tendencies are found in all cultures, and even in other species. Costa and McCrae (2006, 27) note that”the hypothesis of intrinsic maturation is supported indirectly by evidence that similar age trends are found in other primates. Indeed, anyonef amiliar with puppies and old dogs can understand how the human decline in Excitement Seeking might be biologically based.”\nWhile I have not read the aforementioned articles, their measurements are suspect. Age is obviously playing a massive role in this. We know from the political socialization literature that political opinions/ideology is strongly influenced by parents and family at a young age. Are we not sure personality is part of that socialization process?\nI do agree with the statement that political behavior influencing personality is unlikely.\nPersonality -&gt; certain political behavior\n\nokay this is fine.\n\nPersonality is rooted in biology, and that effects of political behavior on personality are unlikely.\nDo environmental and trait effects operate independently of one another, or in combination?\n“Last, we reiterate that because of clear evidence regarding the heritabiltiy of the five-factor trait structure, any findings we report regarding the effects of personality on political behavior will be strongly suggestive of a role for personality as a mechanism linking biology and politics.”\n\n\nMeasuring the Big Five\n\nSelf reported descriptions of personality THIS IS A BIG ISSUE!\n\nthey at least recognize it and argue that this is not a big issue cause of other tests involving peer evaluations and stuff.\n\n\n\n\nOther Measurement:\nDV: ten DVs that collectivel encompass a wide array of participatory acts."

The legislators sometimes stated their issue positions in these letters, sometimes supported by extensive arguments but sometimes minimally justified; in many cases, these issue positions were at odds with voters’. An ostensibly unrelated survey found that voters often adopted the positions legislators took, even when legislators offered little justification.

    "text": "Abramowitz, Alan and Kyle Saunders. 2008. “Is Polarization a Myth?,” Journal of Politics.\n\nAbstract\nThis article uses data from the American National Election Studies and national exit polls to test Fiorina’s assertion that ideological polarization in the American public is a myth. Fiorina argues that twenty-first-century Americans, like the mid twentieth-century Americans described by Converse, “are not very well-informed about politics, do not hold many of their views very strongly, and are not ideological” (2006, 19). However, our evidence indicates that since the 1970s, ideological polarization has increased dramatically among the mass public in the United States as well as among political elites. There are now large differences in outlook between Democrats and Republicans, between red state voters and blue state voters, and between religious voters and secular voters. These divisions are not confined to a small minority of activists—they involve a large segment of the public and the deepest divisions are found among the most interested, informed, and active citizens. Moreover, contrary to Fiorina’s suggestion that polarization turns off voters and depresses turnout, our evidence indicates that polarization energizes the electorate and stimulates political participation.\n\n\nBumping Sticker\nWe think Fiorina is wrong. - Abramowitz and Saunders\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nis it just elites that have become polarized?\nDoes the ideological debates between elites have any resonance with the masses?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nConverse argues much of the american electorate are not ideological\n\nEducation is strongly correlated with ideological thinking\n\nsince Converse, Americans have become more educated.\n\n\nElites have also become more ideological and the public knows more about their ideological conflict.\nConsensus on elite level ideological divisions\n\nlittle is known about ideological divisions at the mass level.\n\n\n\nFiorina Claims:\n\nModeration: Most Americans are ideological moderates.

Are they using ideological frameworks in thinking about politics?\n\nFiorina thinks no. Converse still holds up.\n\nAccording to Fiorina, the ideological disputes that engage political elites and acti-vists have little resonance among the American mass public: like their midtwentieth-century counterparts, ordinary twenty-ﬁrst-century Americans ‘’are not very well-informed about politics, do not hold manyof their views very strongly, and are not ideological’’\n\n\nFiorina understates division among the masses.\ndeepest divisions are among those most interested, informed and active members of the public\n\nso then the question is, have more voters become more interested, informed, and active?\n\nI didn’t see this stated anywhere, BUT i have a feeling our authors are going to argue that there is more polarization and that there are more ideological thinkers among the masses.

Favorite one so far this week.\n\nAbstract:\nThe current debate over the extent of polarization in the American mass public focuses on the extent to which partisans’ policy preferences have moved. Whereas “maximalists” claim that partisans’ views on policies have become more extreme over time (Abramowitz 2010), “minimalists” (Fiorina and Abrams 2009) contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occurred reflects sorting, i.e., the increased association between partisanship and ideology. We argue in favor of an alternative definition of polarization, based on the classic concept of social distance (Bogardus 1947). using data from a variety of sources, we demonstrate that both republicans and democrats increasingly dislike, even loathe, their opponents. We also find that partisan affect is inconsistently (and perhaps artifactually) founded in policy attitudes. the more plausible account lies in the nature of political campaigns; exposure to messages attacking the out-group reinforces partisans’ biased views of their opponents.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nAmericans are affectively polarized.\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nTo what extent do partisans view each other as a disliked social outgroup?\nHow much does affective polarization matter in the public?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nElites are significantly more partisan.\nAuthors argue a better way to test polarization is not party identity but rather, affective polarization.\n” in our view, is that the mere act of identifying with a political party is sufficient to trigger negative evaluations of the opposition, and exposure to prolonged media-based campaigns only reinforces these predispositions.” p.3\nHumans typically categorize themselves into groups. - Tajfel\n\nwhich group becomes salient is important\n\nbecause they give cues.\n\n\nCampaign importance has grown.\n\nmore campaign information cause internet.\n\nmore exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\nNational and cross-national surveys in the USA and United Kingdom.\n\n6 data sets\nANES, 2008 YouGov poll of US and UK voters, Almond and Verba, 2004 Blair Center Election study, AP-Yahoo!

    "text": "Mason, Lilliana. 2018. “Ideologues without Issues: The Polarizing Consequences of Ideological Identities,” Public Opinion Quarterly.\n\nAbstract:\nThe distinction between a person’s ideological identity and their issue positions has come more clearly into focus in recent research. Scholars have pointed out a significant difference between identity based and issue-based ideology in the American electorate. However, the affective and social effects of these separate elements of ideology have not been sufficiently explored. Drawing on a national sample collected by SSI and data from the 2016 ANES, this article finds that the identity based elements of ideology are capable of driving heightened levels of affective polarization against outgroup ideologues, even at low levels of policy attitude extremity or constraint. These findings demonstrate how Americans can use ideological terms to disparage political opponents without necessarily holding constrained sets of policy attitudes.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\n\nAim(s):\n\nThis project examines how the social attachments to the terms “liberal” and “conservative” generate affective polarization against liberals and conservatives in the American electorate, even when issue-based ideology is not extreme.\n\nIn other words, we already know that Democrats and Republicans hate each other, but liberals and conservatives likely hate each other too, for reasons that go beyond partisanship or even issue-based disagreement.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nIdentity-based ideology is associated with increasing affective polarization of ideological groups.\nThis relationship will occur even when issue-based ideology is weak or conflicting with identity-based ideology.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nPolarization: is an increasing distance between partisans in terms of their issue-based ideology, sometimes referred to as “ideological polarization”\n\n\nIssue based ideology:\n\nBelief system (Converse) - A system of beliefs can be defined by a set of opinions and the degree to which they form measurable patterns.\n\n\n\nIdentity based ideology:\n\nPrior research has found that the names “liberal” and “conservative” confer a sense of group identity that is not neatly connected to any set of issue positions, but nonetheless motivates political judgment\nIt is characterized by a uniquely social connection to the groups that hold the labels “liberal” and “conservative.”\n\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nShe measure how strongly they are ideological\nissue based measurement\nmarriage question - her own survey"

Asymmetric Politics: Ideological Republicans and Group-Interest Democrats, Ch. 2.\nbig claims but very interesting.\n\nBackground:\n\nAuthor argues Democrats are more pragmatic.\n\nRepublicans are more ideologically driven.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s character as a social group coalition fosters a relatively pragmatic, results-oriented style of politics in which officeholders are rewarded for delivering concrete benefits to targeted groups in order to address specific social problems.\nRepublicans, in contrast, are more likely to forge partisan ties based on common ideological beliefs, encouraging party officials to pursue broad rightward shifts ni public policy.\nAs a result, Republican voters and activists are more likely than their Democratic counterparts to prize symbolic demonstrations of ideological purity and to pressure their party leaders to reject moderation and compromise.\nThis dynamic is reflected in the partisan attitudes within the public at large.\nPublic is operationally liberal and symbolically conservative.\nRepublicans more likely to view their party as standing for abstract values.\nFun interesting quote from FDR:\n\n“Roughly speaking, the liberal school of thought recognizes that the new conditions throughout the world call for new remedies. . (that can be adopted and successfuly maintained in this country under our present form of government if we use government as an instrument of cooperation to provide these remedies…the opposing or conservative school of thought, as a general proposition, does not recognize the need for Government itself to step in and take action to meet these new problems. It believes that individual initiative and private philanthropy will solve them-that we ought to repeal many of the things we have done and go back [to prior policies].”\n\npretty much sums of the left-right dimension.\n\n\nRepublican propensity for ideological thinking is not simply due to religion or education; rather, is is a product of the movement’s successful communication of its version of american political tradition to the party’s electorate.\n\nFrank Luntz.\n\nStrong Democratic identifiers consistently describe politics as a competition among social groups for favorable concrete policies and benefits, whereas strong Republicans explain the salient differences between the parties as concerning a more abstract conflict over the proper role of government.\nBoth hold policy positions but differ in REASONING!\nDemocrats more closely match social identity\nRepublicans more closely match ideological identity as described by Abramowitz & Saunders.\nRepublican voters value purists\nDemocratic voters value people that compromise.\nDavid Broockman and Christopher Skovron found that politicians dramatically overestimated the proportion of their constituents who agreed with conservative positions on abolishing welfare programs, implementing universal health coverage, and allowing same-sex marriage.? Though politicians in both parties exhibited this bias, Republicans overestimated conservative issue positions by a much larger margin than did Democrats-usually by more than 20 percent, implying that they viewed the average legislative district as more collectively conservative than the nation’s most conservative districts are in actuality.\n\nCOOL CONNECTION TO FENNO\nBroockman.\n\nSocial conservatism history in the US is very deep\nElite rhetoric reinforces the asymmetries in public support for the views expressed in each party.\npeople identify in different parties for different reasons.\ndemocrats generally define themselves politically through their social group ties and describe their party as representing groups they identify with\nrepublicans are more likely to represent themselves in their vision of government and society in some abstract battle.\nfigure 2-6 kinda the punchline."

    "text": "Barber, Michael and Jeremy Pope. 2018. “Does Party Trump Ideology? Disentangling Party and Ideology in America,” American Political Science Review.\n\nAbstract:\nAre people conservative (liberal) because they are Republicans (Democrats)? Or is it the reverse: people are Republicans (Democrats) because they are conservatives (liberals)? Though much has been said about this long-standing question, it is difficult to test because the concepts are nearly impossible to disentangle in modern America. Ideology and partisanship are highly correlated, only growing more so over time. However, the election of President Trump presents a unique opportunity to disentangle party attachment from ideological commitment. Using a research design that employs actual “conservative” and “liberal” policy statements from President Trump, we find that low-knowledge respondents, strong Republicans, Trump-approving respondents, and self-described conservatives are the most likely to behave like party loyalists by accepting the Trump cue—in either a liberal or conservative direction. These results suggest that there are a large number of party loyalists in the United States, that their claims to being a self-defined conservative are suspect, and that group loyalty is the stronger motivator of opinion than are any ideological principles.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nIdeology is not as sticky as we think\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nAre people conservative because they are Republicans? Or is it the reverse: people are Republicans because they are conservatives?\nAnother way of putting this question of party versus ideology is to ask how sincerely held are expressed political and policy opinions and are these opinions based on ideological convictions or group loyalty?\nwho is most likely to be a party loyalist? Or, what characteristics will moderate the effects of the treatment?\nto what extent are positions malleable?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nVery hard to separate partisanship from issue positions or any ideological commitments that may result from those positions.\nParty affiliation has been shown to be a social identity (Campbell et al. Reference Campbell, Converse, Miller and Stokes1960; Green, Palmquist and Schickler Reference Green, Palmquist and Schickler2004; Greene Reference Greene1999; Tajfel Reference Tajfel1981), to be a heuristic about policy views (Cohen Reference Cohen2003; Rahn Reference Rahn1993), and influence people’s issue attitudes (Layman and Carsey Reference Layman and Carsey2002). People have also been shown to take cues from the party leader’s positions (Lenz Reference Lenz2012).\nTrump is a unique opportunity because he shifts all over the place on policy issues.\nDistinguishing between partisan and policy loyalists is hard. Trump makes this easier.\nThe heart of the theory is based on the importance of these partisan cues and how different types of citizens will interpret the cues.\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nPartisan Loyalists: unswervingly loyal to their party, but they care very little (if at all) about the underlying issues endorsed by the party.\n\nPartisan loyalists merely take the party line on all issues—regardless of whatever that position might be.\n\nPolicy Loyalists: These people exhibit high levels of issue constraint and should be highly loyal to the underlying principles and policies that arise from those principles.\n\nLoyalty to those ideas implies that policy loyalists should remain faithful to those principles regardless of which party or partisan leader espouses those views.\n\nNote: people probably exemplify some degree of both these concepts.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe influence of a Trump cue will demonstrate the existence of a large bloc of party loyalists in the electorate when his influence moves opinion in either a liberal or conservative direction based on the cue.\nknowledge hypothesis is that only the unknowledgeable should react to the cue and behave as party loyalists, presumably because the knowledgeable gain little from the treatment.\npartisan hypothesis holds that those who strongly affiliate with the party of the cue giver should be more likely to be party loyalists.\napproval hypothesis holds that those who approve of the cue giver should be more likely to be party loyalists.\nsymbolic ideology hypothesis—self-described conservatives should hold firm to their presumed beliefs and be less likely to be party loyalists because they willingly identify with an ideological camp and as such likely adhere to the policy tenets of that group.\n\n\n\nCritical Point To Uncover:\n\nif the less knowledgeable express more conservative views in the face of a conservative Trump cue and more liberal views in the face of a liberal Trump cue, then this is evidence for partisan loyalism.\n\nshowing both shows partisan loyalty.\n\nIf, on the other hand, there is only a reaction to the conservative Trump cue, then the evidence does not support partisan loyalism.\n\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nrepresentative survey of Americans collected by YouGov survey research company in early 2017, immediately after the inauguration of Donald Trump\n\n1,300 total respondents who were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions and a control condition.\n\nThose in the control condition (500 respondents) were presented with a policy statement and then asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the policy statement they had just read.\nThose respondents who were assigned to one of the three treatment conditions saw a similar statement with a small addition.\n\nthe treatment was different stimuli citing Trump’s position on the matter. Because he has supported the same policy from different ideological perspectives, it allows the researcher to give the respondent a liberal cue of Trump and a conservative cue.\n\n\nTrump has to have actually taken both sides of an issue at some point.\n\nwhich means these positions are NOT made up.\n\n\nAsk 10 questions.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\npartisans emphasize group attachment over issue positions.\nAmong Republicans, the politically knowledgeable, those who do not approve of the cue giver, and self-described moderates and liberals are not all that likely to change their views when informed of President Trump’s positions.\nThe implication of this unique test is that large, predictable segments of the public—partisans, the less-informed, approvers of the party leader, and even those who claim the most strong symbolic ideological labels—are likely to be influenced more by partisanship than by any issue content.\nFirst, no group reacts to a cue that comes from Republican leaders in Congress.\n\nTrump has some extraordinary sway that republican leaders do not have.\n\nDemocrats and Independents do not react to Trump cues, but Republicans do\nwe find strong support for both the knowledge and the approval hypotheses within the broader population.\nThose least knowledgeable and most approving of Trump are more likely to react to a Trump cue\nHowever, our results run exactly in the opposite direction of the ideology hypothesis. In fact, it is those most likely to call themselves strong conservatives who are most influenced by the cue, regardless of the direction of the cue. Strong conservatives move the most when faced with a conservative Trump cue and when faced with a liberal Trump cue.\n\nso their ideological stance is actually a bit shaky it seems.\n\nHigher-knowledge individuals are more likely to look like policy loyalists than party loyalists. On the other hand, low-knowledge individuals display the opposite pattern.\nThe simple truth is that many citizens behave as partisan loyalists rather than principled ideologues."

A specific type of information from a matrix. It is easier to talk about a single number than the whole data.\n\nDeterminants measure the factor of how much the area of a given region increases or decreases in space.\n\nhow much does the transformation stretch or squish “things”.\n\nthe determinant tells us the factor of how much a given area stretches or squishes.\n\nin 3 dimensions this tells us the factor of change in volume\n\n\n\nIf the determinant is zero, it is squishes all of space onto a line or single point. Since then, the area of any region would be zero.\nDeterminants are non-zero if the matrix has full rank\nonly a square matrix can have a determinant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an inverse is badly scaled or ill-conditioned, then the inverse is unstable. This means a tiny change in just one of the elements of the original matrix can result in HUGE changes in many (or all) of the elements of its inverse.\nKnowing how it is calculated isn’t super important. You can just google this if needed. Our computers can do this all as it gets much more tedious when we increase the # of dimensions.\nYou can compute a negative determinant (pre absolute value).

You can apply a transformation to it - rotate it, stretch bits, squash bits, etc. If you paint an arrow on the shape, after the transformation the arrow will most likely be pointing a different direction.\nBut sometimes the transformation you apply conspires to make so that the arrow doesn’t change direction. Maybe it gets stretched or squished, but it still points in the same direction. From the arrow’s perspective, all you did was scale it up or down in size by some amount.\nIf that happens, the arrow is called an eigenvector of the transformation, and the amount it gets scaled by is its associated eigenvalue. They are properties of the transformation itself, not the shape you apply it to.”\n\nA matrix can have multiple eigenvalues BUT no more than its number or rows/columns.\nEach eigenvalue is associate with a specific eigenvector.\nYou can get negative eigenvalues but they are not good for us in statistics.\n\n\nDefinite\n\neigenvalues are closely related to definiteness.\nWhy do we care about definiteness?\n\nIt is useful for establishing if a (multivariate) function has a maximum, minimum or neither at a critical point.\n\nthis is important for regression (OLS). We are trying to find the line that minimizes the squared difference.\n\n\nWe want positive definiteness.\n\nTo have positive definiteness we need our matrix to satisfy the following:\n\nsymmetric\nall eigenvalues are positive\nall the subdeterminants are positive\nyou could also just calculate the quadratic form and check its positiveness\n\nif the quadratic form is &gt; 0 then it is positive definiteness.\nwe want a positive definite matrix because it is good for interpretation."

Their overall format is the same but the shorthand symbols, such as “dx,” are replaced by their stylized version of the letter d: \\(\\partial\\). Partial derivatives should be labeled as \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\), depending on the variable being derived.\nThe two derivatives should be read as “The partial derivative, with respect to x,” and “The partial derivative, with respect to y.”\n\nWhen taking a partial derivative with respect to a particular variable, treat all other variables as though they are constants.\n\nWhen deriving with respect to x, treat y as a constant, and do not derive the y.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\\(f(x,y)=x^2y+2x^3\\)\n\\(f(x,y)=xy^2+x^3\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x)y^2+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3)=y^2 +3x^2\\)\n\ntake the partial derivative, with respect to x.\n\nhold y constant.\nthe \\(y^2+3x^2\\) is the rate of change for the function.\n\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}x(y^2)+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}x^3=2xy+0=2xy\\)\n\ntake the partial derivative, with respect to y.\n\nhold x constant. `\nthe \\(2xy\\) is the rate of change for the function."

(British spelling)\nAbstract: This article discusses and reviews the growing literature on the nexus of macro-level structures and individual behaviour that some studies are a part of. It looks at the effects that macro-level institutions and contexts have on citizen behaviour, along with how political institutions and the environment where citizens form opinions and act, help in moderating the effects of individual-level factors on citizen behaviour. The modelling structures and behaviour, effects of structures on voter behaviour, and the interactions of structures and behaviour in research on economic voting are some of the topics covered in the article.\nOutline:\n\nDoes x cause behaviour y? It depends!\n\nExample: Does institutional performance affect people’s sense of whether their political system is legitimate?\n\nAnswer: The impact of corruption on system support is conditional on whether citizens are supporters of the incumbent government.\n\nStudies are getting better at using institutions and context to predict the effects of citizen behaviour.\n\nComparative study of structures and behaviour = citizens in context \nContext and behaviour intimately connected by:\n\nFormal and informal rules; people’s preferences, attitudes, and behaviour affect the establishment and functioning of rules\nCitizens are exposed to variable social, political, and economic environments that they are supposed to understand, interpret, and sometimes shape\n\nAdvances in surveys, replication, and computing have allowed for cross-national and multi-level research into behaviour\n1980s and 1990s renewed focus on institutional questions across polysci that could be tested, as well as interest in developing contextual theories of political behaviour\nComparative study of behaviour politics has investigated macro-level contexts/structures:\n\nInstitutions\nStructural conditions\n\nInteraction between structures and behaviour presumes several things:\n\nPolitics is about the interaction of people’s values and the rules and conditions that govern the implementation of those values\nThe rules and realities in which citizens make choices are themselves a function of people’s values\n\n“Put another way: contexts are critical for understanding the decisions people make because they affect different people differently, and people’s decisions, in turn, shape the nature, shape, and stability of these contexts” (678).\n\n\nCommon approach assumes that context shapes behaviour; assumes behaviour to be DV and that it is exogenous and stable\n\nDo institutions have direct effects on behaviour?\n\nVoting example: structures can affect voters directly, indirectly, and interactively (or contingently)\n\nDirect: rational choice theory; individuals weigh costs and benefits of voting and act accordingly\nIndirect: behaviours of elites within electoral rules empower or constrain citizen choices; structures have consequences but these consequences have secondary (or indirect) effects on behaviour\nContingent: effect of some structural feature strengthened or weakened, depending on presence of some 3rd variable; the turnout gap between individuals with many and few resources is particularly pronounced in countries where the cost of voting is high\n\n\n\n\n{INSERT PHOTO HERE}\n\nRecent studies have looked at how the nature of a country’s representative structures interacts with the willingness of voters to punish governments for bad economic performance\n\nBad economy impact hinges on ability of voters to hold gov’t responsible\nInstitutions can hamper this ability of voters to reward or punish gov’ts\nClarity of responsibility also varies over time within (and across) countries b/c of election outcomes that change bargaining power and reshape context\nAlso contingent upon credible alternatives for voters to vote into office\n\nInteractions of vote choice and structures in research on legitimacy\n\nWhat role do institutions play in moderating sense of loss or victory citizens feel?\n\nInstitutions shape the responses of winners and losers; citizen attitudes toward democratic institutions shaped by country’s political context\n\n\n“At the end of the day, what is particularly noteworthy about cross-level investigations of behavioural politics is that they hold the promise of producing a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of political life by connected hitherto unconnected streams of scholarship in the areas of institutions, political economy, policy, and behaviour and allowing us a better and more complex empirical and theoretical handle on the hows and whys of citizen politics” (690)."

    "text": "Lipset, Seymour Martin. 1959. “Democracy and Working-Class Authoritarianism.” American Sociological Review 24(4): 482-501.\n\nDependent Variable: Support for democracy \n\n\nIndependent Variable: Authoritarian predisposition of the lower strata \nANTECEDENT FACTORS OF IV: Lower strata lack “sophistication” and suffer economic and  psychological insecurities (intervening variables). \n\n\nKEY TERMS:\nauthoritarianism, democracy, strata, liberalism (political and economic),  conservatism, communism, socialism \n\n\nPUZZLE:\nThe intellectual left has a hard time reconciling the normative position of a  “proletarian” revolution as a necessary progressive force and the evidence of a “totalitarian degeneration of Communism” (quoting “The Choice of Comrades,”Encounter, 3 (December 1954), p. 25. Arnold A. Rogow, cited p.482).  \n\n\nKEY ARGUMENT:\nFollowing evidence and psychological research on personality traits of  different society’s strata, Lipset posits that the lower strata are predisposed to support  authoritarianism due to a lack of “sophistication” and facing economic and psychological  insecurity. The lower class will support economic liberalism but not political liberalism, while the  middle and upper class will support political liberalism. Hence, according to Lipset, there is a  natural link between the lower-class attitudes and their support of Communism. \n-Pre-1914: working-class supported both economic and political liberalism \n-Post-1914: “The intransigent, intolerant, and demonological aspects of Communist ideology attract members from the lower class of low-income, low-status occupations, and little education” (483).\n\n\nDEMOCRATIC VALUES AND STRATIFICATION:\n• “Leftism/economic liberalism associated with socio-economic status” (485). • “Psychologically oriented investigators have studied the social correlates of authoritarian  personality structures as measured by the now famous F scale”(Adorno, 1950, cited p.  486). \n• Even in conservatism, economic status predicts tolerance levels (see Eysenck, 1956 and  Stouffer, 1955, cited p.486)\n\n\nAUTHORITARIAN RELIGION AND STRATIFICATION:\n• Fundamentalist and chiliastic/millennial religious tradition as a predisposition for drastic  and rapid measures demanding authoritarian order. \n• The appeal of fundamentalism to the lower class acts as a pressure valve in a utopian world  where the upper class no longer dominates. \n• See Engels and his take on evangelism (488). \n\n\nTYPICAL SOCIAL SITUATION OF LOWER-CLASS PERSON\n\n“There is consistent evidence that degree of formal education, itself closely correlated with  social and economic status, is also highly correlated with undemocratic attitudes” (489). • Education predicts attitudes better than occupation (Morris Janowitz and Dwaine Marvick study, cited pp.489-490). \nPrincipal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  “sophistication,” economic security, and psychological security -&gt; mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = “surviving”  \n\n\n\nTHE PERSPECTIVES OF LOWER-CLASS GROUPS\n\nPrincipal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  “sophistication,” economic security, and psychological security -&gt; mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = “surviving”\nIncapacity of mental abstraction and fixed mental context\n\n\n\nEXTREMISM AS A COMPLEX ALTERNATIVE: A TEST OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nWhen the Communist Party is small and weak, it tends to uphold non-economic  liberalism/democratic values because of the presence of intellectual leadership. \nWhen the Communist Party (or Socialist in some cases) is a mass party, it tends to be more  authoritarian (or less committed to democratic values) because it has stripped its  intellectual leadership.\nUnderdeveloped countries/economies exacerbate the problems of the lower class and  increase the predisposition to authoritarianism on a like-for-like basis. \nThis argument is evaluated subnationally and supports the urban/rural predisposition to  uphold democratic values and political liberalism.\n\nHISTORICAL PATTERNS AND DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS\n\nHistorically, the left has been responsible for democratization; intellectual leadership still  supports democratic values, but the masses of the lower strata do not understand the  implications of the left beyond economic value to them. \nConservatism is vulnerable in democracy for demographic reasons (500). • Neither conservatism nor the authoritarian predisposition of the lower class should be seen  as a threat to democracy. \nEducational attainment is an essential “Social Requisites of Democracy” (Lipset, 1959)."

Zuckerman, Ed., The Social Logic of Politics: Personal Networks as Contexts for Political Behavior. Temple University Press.\n\nChapter 1: Returning to the Social Logic of Political Behavior\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Despite a period of deviation from theory, social logic is important for studying political choice.” \n\n\nSummary: \nThis chapter offers an intellectual history of the critical texts that defined the research orientation of political behavior. Is focuses on how traditional theories from sociology and psychology informed our understanding of political behaviors through interactions with primary groups. However, along the way, the political science discipline that studied behavior began undergoing changes to the way behavioral study was approached - emphasizing, instead, individual level survey research and a reconceptualization of social logic. Fortunately, social logic is back on the mend. \n\n\nResearch Question/Purpose: \nThe purpose of this chapter is to outline the reasons for which those who study political choice and behavior should return to the social logic of the original behavioral revolution in political science. \n\n\nData/Methods: \nThere is no data used. Passages, statements, and long quotations stand in for the data. Draws on authors such as Campbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes, Verba Findings: \nWe need to return to our roots an incorporate social logic back into behavioral political science \nInterpersonal relationships can both prevent and facilitate change \nMany scholars broke away from social logic, pursuing instead individual level analysis from surveys and redefining social logic to fit their particular needs Newer research is returning to social logic\n\n\nDefinitions: \nSocial Logic of Politics:\na theory of politics that emphasizes the ways in which social factors (social identities, distribution of power across groups, public opinion) influence individual behaviors and how those interact with institutional structures to effect the political process. \n\n\nDiscussion Questions: \nWhat are the consequences of the social logic of politics for our understanding of those communities/persons with intersectional identities? Is this theory anglo centric, or does it retain its superior qualities across groups? \nHow might association through primary groups have an impact of institutions? At what point does the saliency of group association diminish? Do our politics/attitudes change drastically with each primary group we grow closer to, or do those groups we first develop our attitudes through matter most? \n\n\nAdditional Notes: \n\n\nIntro: \nThe immediate social circumstances of people’s lives influence what they believe and do about politics \nImmediate social circles are powerful forces in swaying ones political beliefs and actions \nGroup relationships are important for fixing and maintaining opinions in relation to large parts of the political system (such as parties) (Key, 1961) \n\n\nSources in Sociology: \nparticularly influential were Lazarsfeld, Katz, Berelson, Gaudet, and McPhee Electoral Sociology was where the onset of the behavioral revolution in political science first observed electoral choice \nVoting is a reflection of our behavior - of our conversations with other people and the attitudes we shape through those interactions \nBy this logic, we vote based on how the relationships we have shape us This is counter to theories of voting as a rational act \n\n\nSources in Social Psychology \nparticularly influential were Kurt Lewin and Leon Festinger \nhelped explain conformity\nsharing an identity (social class, ethnicity, religion, etc.) does NOT define a social group \nopinions, preferences, and beliefs are a joint function of how “real” the matter is, the views held by the members of a person’s groups, and the persons own conceptions joining a group tends to produce changes in opinions and attitudes toward alignment with the group \n\n\nThe Turn Away from the Social Logic of Politics \n\nStarted to examine individuals instead of groups \nBegan surveying a lot (members of the same social circles shouldn’t be surveyed together -- its no longer as-if random, and you introduce bias into your survey responses) \nTurned social groups into objects of individual identification \nElectoral research shifted towards understanding party identification and perceptions of candidates \n\n\nWhat factors explain this shift away from the social logic? \nOne set derives from decision to use national sample surveys as the exclusive source of empirical evidence of behavior \nAnother set derives from theory issues -- PoliSci insisted that sociologists couldn’t explain electoral decisions or outcomes -- opted instead for immediate determinants of vote choice: attitudes and calculations \nStatistics professors, rearing political sciences, conveyed cherished assumptions of independent sampling -- which makes it nearly impossible to capture the psychology of inter-dependance \n\n\nRecognizing that data problems inhibited their ability to follow theoretical preferences \nCampbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes altered the definition of the social group and conceptualized it according to a personal perceptions regarding a reference object - taking it far away from its original intent/definition from Lewis Many others would make even larger breaks, such as Key and Downs (immediate circle provides no more than time-saving sources of information to calculating citizens) \n\n\n\nReturning (Again) to the Social Logic of Politics \nWe returned! \nMichigan survey responses can be used to study the role of immediate social structures on political choice and behavior \nTon of other research is starting to do the same thing"

    "text": "Converse, Philip E. 2006 [1964]. “The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics.” Critical  Review: A Journal of Politics and Society 18(1): 1-74\n\nNormative question: \nDoes the citizenry have the “capacity” to participate in democracy? Concern the age-old  question of the demos’ potential to access information and process it in a way that would be  individually coherent in election expressions. Converse’s (1964) “The Nature of Belief Systems  in Mass Publics” marks a turning point since it can quantitatively/statistically demonstrate\ndemocracy defenders’ worst fears: the mass public competence for a normative functioning of  democracy is blight. This question has also been approached with similar results by Lipmann (1922), “Public Opinion” and Schumpeter (1950), “Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy” (see  also Bennett, 2006, “Democratic Competence, Before Converse and After”). \n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nMass Public: Ideologically Innocent  \n\n\nDV:\nDegree of Belief System Coherence (Individual) (a continuum)\n\n\nIV:\nLevel of Constrained Idea-Elements (a continuum)\n\n\nData:\nConverse stipulates that the degree of coherence of the mass public belief system is contingent on the level of constraints of the idea-elements populating a belief system: the more constrained, the  more coherent. This, in turn, predicts a degree of capacity to participate in democracy according  to one’s self-assessed ideological placement. Idea-elements are mainly constrained by the  transmission of information and its digestibility. For this reason, Converse finds that 15% of the  population is deemed ideologue or near-ideologue (possessing a coherent belief system = elite political actors). In contrast, the remaining 85% (the masses) float between having a particular  interest (issue public) or having no idea. If ideology is not driving most of the public’s opinion  incentive, what is? Converse suggests that “visible” social groupings serve as a stable heuristic  informing public opinion: party ID (.70) has more bearing than policies, but policies concerning  visible groups (school desegregation .45) have more bearing than regular policies (government and housing .28). This “ideology by proxy” might produce idiosyncratic outcomes as well: the  working man associating with Socialists against the rich but against government reigning of private  enterprise’s provision of public goods. \n\nPICTURE HERE\nAcquiring and processing information is contingent on education. Education is more prevalent in  higher strata of society (Lipset, 1959, “Social Requisite of Democracy”).\n\nPICTURE HERE\n\n\nInteresting proposition: “The net result of these circumstances is that the elites of the leftist parties enjoy a”natural” numerical superiority, yet they are cursed with a clientele that is less dependable or solid in its support. The rightist elite has a natural clientele that is more limited but more dependable.”"

The article serves as an overview of the topic. It begins by locating the network research within the rich substantive and theoretical tradition of individually and #group-based studies of #electoral #politics and #public #opinion . It addresses some methodological issues in the study of political information #networks. The article ends with the discussion of theoretical and substantive insights that were generated in several studies, such as the study of communication and persuasion among citizens.\n\n\nResearch Question:\nWhat is network analysis? What are the theoretical and substantive insights that we can derive from it, particularly regarding the study of communication and persuasion among citizens? What are some of the methodological issues of network analysis?\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nThe author sets out to analyze the contribution of network theories, which have provided us the ability to analyze citizen and democratic politics from across the micro-macro spectrum. Network theories draw on the importance of groups, communities, and political information networks among and between individuals (Downs 1957) while incorporating a conceptual apparatus that extends far past the traditional notions of primary groups, organizations, and societal groups in order to define the relationships that exist among individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Despite its advantages, there are still some methodological issues with network analysis.\n\n\nData/Methods:\nIt is a literature review so no real data/methods.\n\n\nFindings:\n\nWhat is network analysis and how does it fit into the existing literature on the study of individuals and groups?\n\nNetwork studies can be seen as a particular species within a larger genus—as one type of a contextual analysis of politics (Knoke 1990)\nnetworks are formed at the complex intersection between individual preference, individual engagement, and individual location within particular contexts.\nEulau (1986) and Przeworski and Teune (1970) define contextual factors in terms of the aggregation of individual characteristics that affect individuals through processes of social interaction.\n\nNetwork Studies diverge from contextual studies in their effort to incorporate a direct mapping for the particular patterns of recurrent interaction among actors.\n\nIndividual level and aggregate level analysis both suffer from the same problem: they ignore the implications that arise due to patterns of individual interdependence located in time, place, and setting.\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the methodological issues of the study of political information networks?\n\nAbsent direct measures on patterns of communication, neither the individual measures nor their associated aggregate versions directly address the specifics of communication and persuasion among the individuals who make up the aggregates.\nNetwork studies are particularly useful in analyzing well defined populations - such as clergies, political elites, court, and legislatures.\n\nan unfortunate limitation of egocentric networks is the failure to embed dyads within larger networks and in the context of all other dyads in that same network.\nHowever, they aren’t straightforward when analyzing large populations - which is the primary object of study for scholars concerned with studies of mass behavior (egocentric network survey questions and snowball surveys can help address this; pg. 5-6)\n\nPolitical communication networks are created at the intersection of individual choice (demand) and environmental supply (which is stochastic).\n\n\n\nWhat are the substantive and theoretical insights generated by it?\n\nPeople are more inclined to discuss politics with others who share similar political beliefs\nStudies ALSO demonstrate that patterns of both agreement and disagreement can be profitably understood within complex processes of communication and persuasion\n\nThis means that there is persistent heterogeneity of opinions in less-dense (larger) social networks people aren’t as afraid of disagreement as we initially thought\n\nPolitical heterogeneity in the form of cross cutting cleavages can depress political participation BUT increased levels of tolerance (which might be good?)\nPolitical communication networks are more important in less developed democracy, where parties are less institutionalize and politics is more volatile\nDiversity of group discussion decreases the susceptibility of individuals to issue framing by elites\nNetwork studies of political communication and persuasion provide a theoretical, analytical response to the human limitations of the citizen in democratic politics.\n\nthis is important because it to do with the cognitive limitations of individuals in being self-contained, fully informed, independent maximizers\nparticularly useful is social capital - which allows people to rely on one another for accurate information\n\npolitical interdependence among citizens helps to explain why public opinion in the aggregate is more sophisticated than the opinions held by the average citizen - its more fully informed\nsolutions to collective action problems can be seen as occurring within networks of relationships among strategic actors who use the information they acquire through repeated interactions to facilitate group efforts"

There are two lines of literature that provide contradictory findings:\n\nOne argues that threat increases authoritarian preferences among those that are more prone to authoritarianism\nAnother argues that threat is associated with a switch in ideology among those who are normally non-authoritarian Using a two-wave panel study of the French population taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris, the authors find that the two occur simultaneously.\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\nWhat best explains the relationship between individual perceptions of threat and increased preferences for authoritarian policy?\nIs the increase in support for authoritarian policies following a terrorist attack the result of:\n\nconservative and authoritarian prone individuals just more strongly manifesting their disposition in response to threat\nOR increases in ideological “switching” to support authoritarian policies in light of threatening events?\n\n\n\nTheory/Argument:\nThe authors argue that the endorsement of authoritarian policies can be explained by the theory of affective intelligence. When people experience anxiety due to novel circumstances, such as that induced by terrorist attacks, they will abandon their habitual political attachments and attend to the circumstance in a risk-averse and conservative manner.\n\nH1: increased anger will enhance decision making based on past dispositional convictions, leading to increased polarization between left and right wing individuals (strengthen authoritarian tendencies for right-wing and weaken those same tendencies for the right)\nH2: increased anxiety will initiate decision-making that is less reliant on extant convictions and hence make those on the left end of the left-right scale more attentive and responsive to calls from the right to adopt authoritarian policies.\n\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nTwo-wave panel taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris\nData retrieved from the CEVIPOF barometer of political confidence\n\nsurvey was conducted using a representative sample containing 1,524 respondents in two waves\n\nConstruct two OLS models\n\none measures attitude change as a function of demographic variables, ideology, as well as anxiety and anger\nsecond model includes two interaction terms that assess fear and anger with the left-right scale respectively with the expectation that the effect of fear and anger on authoritarian policies with be conditional on prior ideological conviction\n\n\nModel 1:\n\\[\nAttiude_{t2}=fear_{t2}+anger_{t2}+left/right\\: scale_{t1}+attitude_{t1}+demographics_{t1}\n\\]\nModel 2:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}Attitude_{t2} &= fear_{t2} + anger_{t2} + left/right\\: scale_{t1} \\\\&+ fear_{t2} * left/right\\: scale_1 + anger_{t2} * left/right\\: scale + attitude_{t1} + demographics_{t1}\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nDependent Variable:\n\nsupport for authoritarian policies\na scale consisting of all available items in the study that measure adoption or rejection of authoritarian politic preferences\n\neach item (survey question) was measured using 4-point response option (higher values = support for authoritarian policies)\nonly one factor possessed an eigenvalue over 1\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Variable:\n\nemotional reaction to the terrorist attacks\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nThreat increases authoritarian preferences among those who are more prone to authoritarianism AND those with non-authoritarian ideology\nOverall, people who felt fear following the attack were more likely to have switched their opinion in an authoritarian direction\nLeft-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful after the attack were more likely to change in the direction of endorsing authoritarian policies\nRight-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful did not experience a change in direction of endorsing authoritarian policies\nRight-wing citizens who gelt predominantly angry following the attack experienced heightened endorsement of authoritarianism\nLeft-wing citizen on the far-left who felt predominantly angry were the least likely to support authoritarian politics following the attacks (see figure 3) but is not statistically significant\nH2 is supported by the first OLS model\nH1 is not supported UNTIL the conditional model\n\n\n\nImportance/Contribution:\n\ncontributes to our understanding of individual level variation in the endorsement of authoritarian policies as well as our understanding of attitudinal polarization (why fear might reduce polarization across a public)\nimportant because the psychological mechanisms that account for the public’s reaction to terrorist attacks is key to understanding enhanced support for the restriction of civil liberties\nalso advances and systematizes the literature of emotions and politics by assessing the impact of anxiety and anger on the formation of political attitudes\ntakes advantage of REAL threat perceptions, instead of experimentally manipulated ones\nhas external validity (uses a representative sample of the French population)\nchallenges conventional wisdom that emotions are irrational, turbulent states that hinder reasoning - affect activates political reasoning\n\n\n\nDefinitions/Concepts:\n\nTheories of Affective Intelligence\n\nprovides a framework for understanding the interplay of fear and anger with ideological convictions\nwith respect to anxiety, the theory holds that when citizens find themselves in novel circumstances, they tend to break from habitual political attachments (ideology/partisanship) and actively try to attend to contemporary circumstances about their environment.\nwith respect to anger, the theory holds that it may trigger authoritarian policy preferences through the activation of habitually learned routines, activating conservative or authoritarian attitudes among individuals who already hold a right-wing disposition.\n\nit is not the potency of threat the increases anger, but rather the degree of normative violation\n\n\n\n\nTerror Management Theory (TMT)\n\npeople feel threatened by their own death and therefore adopt worldviews that allow them to find meaning and worth in their lives.\n\nawareness of ones death can cause anxiety\nis used to explain that mortality-related threat reinforces extant political beliefs regardless of whether these are liberal or conservative.\npolitical ideology serves as a protective shield against death anxiety.\n\n\n\n\nLeft-Right Ideological Identification\n\ndefined by the authors as the an organized cluster of political values that make some individuals more inclined to support some political ideas than others.\n\n\n\nThreat\n\ndefined by the authors as an exogenous event that poses harmful consequences for the individual or her environment and evokes negative emotional reactions.\n\n\n\nAnxiety\n\nelevated in threatening circumstances and is one of the prime emotional reactions to a terrorist event when heightened, conveys a perception of increased risk and prompts individuals to adopt risk-averse behavior to eliminate or avert the threat\n\n\n\nAnger\n\ngenerated when people are obstructed from reaching a valued goal by an external agent whose conduct is deemed unfair and in cases when a threatening stimulus is perceived\n\n\n\nThreat Stimulus\n\nAssessed on two distinct grounds:\n\nis the event novel?

This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being “motivated- skepticals” when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e. spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of “partisan processing” that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:\nH1: there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs\nH2: there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments\nH3: there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones\nThese combined will results in:\nH4: attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments\nWhich is conditional upon:\nH5: the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism\nH6: and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nTwo experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control\nThe participants (Ps) were recruited from introductory political science courses at Stony Brook University\nStudy 1: N=126\nStudy 2: N=136\nFirst Part: Confirmation Bias\nThe participants (Ps) were seated at computers and their political attitudes were assessed through the evaluation of a series of contemporary political issues aimed at activating their priors - this was done through random assignment into either condition 1 or condition 2 (see figure 1)\nThey rated the items on a series of scales to assess attitude strength (0-100) and attitude position (like-dislike; 9 item scale)\nThey then viewed information on an information board, where they could seek out hidden policy arguments by known source alone (see figure 2); the amount of time they spend engaging in each argument was recorded by the software.\nThey viewed eight arguments without a time limit, but could only view each argument ONCE\nThey then completed the same attitude battery from the beginning of the experiment before filing out demographic information and a political knowledge scale ( to assess sophistication)\nSecond Part: Disconfirmation Bias\nadministered the battery again, but with the conditions (issues) swapped.\nthen asked to rank the strength of 8 arguments (4 pro and 4 con)\nthen there was a post test battery AGAIN and a recognition memory test\nthey were also asked to list their thoughts regarding two pro and two con arguments they were presented with Arguments were taken from online sources and edited such that they were similar in complexity and length.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nstrong evidence of a prior attitude effect (H1) such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments.\nParticipants counter-argued the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias (H2) - this was supported by the participants spending MORE time on the policy arguments that they disagreed with\nAlso find a confirmation bias (H3)—the seeking out of confirmatory evidence—when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read - this was supported by the participants seeking out information in the matrix that they agreed with\nBoth the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization (H4) —the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes—especially among those with the strongest priors (H5) and highest levels of political sophistication (H6)."

Such measurements tend to vary in terms of how they are phrased on surveys and also struggle to capture the range of partisan identity, typically at the low and high ends of the spectrum. The authors believe that they can develop a multi-item scale of partisan identity that better predicts political behavior ACROSS various multiparty democracies than the traditional single item scales common on surveys. \n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nPartisan Identity Scale\nCreates an Eight-Item Scale of Partisanship that is derived from Social Identity Theory Derives three (3) hypothesis to test whether the scale is better than traditional models: H1: The Partisan Identity Scale should differentiate equally well among low, middling, and high levels of identity to best uncover the link between identity and political activity across its full range. Expect each scale item to provide more complete information about partisan strength than the traditional single party identification item. \nIn terms of the IRT analysis, this means that each item’s information function will be more peaked and contain greater information than the standard single measure of partisan strength. In the three European multi-party systems under study, we expect both lower and higher levels of partisan intensity to remain less well detected when measured with the traditional item\nH2: the partisan identity scale to exhibit all three types of invariance, which means that the fit of the metric invariance model will be no worse than the fit of the configural model, and that the fit of the scalar model will be no worse than that of the metric model. \nH3: The partisan identity scale should more powerfully predict in-party voting and political engagement than the traditional party identification item. We also expect the partisan identity scale to better predict political behavior than a multi-item indicator of ideological intensity \n\n\n\nData:\nUses Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K. as the three countries with which to derive and apply the scale.\n\nNetherlands:\n2012 Dutch Parliamentary elections among members of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The LISS contains 5000 households, entailing 8000 individuals Data are drawn from three time points: August 2012 (‘’Elections 2012’‘), after the national election in September 2012 (’‘Dutch Parliamentary Election Study’‘), and again as part of a module in December 2012/January 2013 (’‘Politics and Values: Wave 6’’).\n\n\nSweden:\nSwedish data were drawn from the Swedish Citizen Panel, a largely opt-in online panel run by the Laboratory of Opinion Research (LORE) at the University of Gothenburg. \nUtilize data from Panel 8 (11/14/13–12/18/13) and add-on Panel 8-2 (12/10/13–1/7/14). 16,130 panelists were invited to take the Panel 8 survey and 9279 completed it for a completion rate of 64 %. \n2000 panelists were invited to complete Panel 8-2 of which 1496 answered the survey. All panelists in Panel 8.2 and a randomly selected 2000 panelists in Citizen Panel 8 received the identity model. \nOur analytic sample is confined to those in Panel 8 and Panel 8-2 who completed the identity items (N = 2464). \n\n\nUK:\nData for the U.K were taken from the 2015 British Election Study (BES), an online panel study conducted by YouGov. \ndraw on data from pre-election wave 3 of the BES, conducted between September 19, 2014 and October 17, 2014 and pre- election wave 4, conducted in March 2015. \nIn total, 27,839 respondents participated in wave 3 and 6141 were randomly assigned and 5954 completed a module that included the partisan identity items. \nIn wave 4, 16,629 respondents participated and 3500 of them completed the partisan identity module.\n\n\n\nMeasures:\nPartisanship Strength by Country vs. Partisan Identity Strength (the 8 Item Scale that is also known as the Partisan Identity Scale) \n\n\nMethods:\nthe methods are pretty complex, but essentially each hypothesis undergoes a different set of tests/inquiry. \nH1 - figure 1 shows how the 8 item scale that the authors derived is better measure of latent partisan strength than the individual measures in each country. This is also event in the peaks that you can see in each figure. They are more much more sensitive to to the full range of the low- high spectrum. H2 - invariance is measured using R software to perform multi-group confirmatory analysis (CFA) Configural invariance is a good fit \nThe partisan scale has the same metric across countries \nIts also scalar across countries \nH3 - analyse the determinants of in-party voting using a logistic regression model \nPartisan identity strength has a sizeable influence on in-party voting and its effects exceed that of partisanship strength. \nPartisan identity predicted in- party vote and participation while holding partisan strength constant\n\n\nFindings:\nLevels of partisanship have decreased in Europe in recent decades. \nThe eight-item partisan identification scale: \n\nprovides greater information about partisan intensity than the standard single-item\npossess the same measurement across all three countries \nbetter predicts in-party voting and political participation than ideological intensity measures"

To the authors, the reason for this has to do with the “hierarchy of values”. When people have obvious values that rank higher than others (humanitarianism, egalitarianism, equality) AND these #values align with political elites values, then partisan identity remains a steady tool with which to measure the political world against. HOWEVER, for some people, the values rank similarly and therefore cause conflicting #preferences that individuals struggle to resolve. Competing values will produce #volatility in partisan opinions specifically when individuals endorse values that cross the fault lines of partisan dialogue \n\n\nData/Methods:\nData: ANES data from 1992, 1994, and 1996\nModel: Estimates several heteroskedastic regression models as well as ordered probit models The heteroskedastic regression models are used because they expect differences in the response variance of party identification survey items to reflect value-conflict \nthis is because citizens with ideologically inconsistent value structures will struggle to identify with one party or another \nthere should be unequal variance across observations (which is heteroskedastic) \nthis heteroskedasticity is modeled to see if those who experience value conflict reveal less predictable responses to party identification survey items than those who do \n\n\nIndependent Variable:\nValue conflict \nis measured using 4 core values in American Politics: \nEgalitarianism, limited government, moral traditionalism, and humanitarianism \nThe measures for these values are derived from a set of ANES survey questions on each value\n1992 and 1996 are the years they were taken from (1992 is missing humanitarianism)\n\n\nDependent Variable:\nPartisan Instability \nTwo “manifestations” \n\npredictability of survey response (those experience value conflict should have less predictable responses to partisan questions) to two survey questions: \n\nseven-point party identification scale and ideological self identification scale \n\nchange in party identification over time (this one is tested using the 1994 and 1996 panel data) \n\n\n\nFindings:\n1992 and 1996 elections reveal value-driven volatility in partisan identification \n\nInstabilities in political views reflect either: \n\nlow information (for some) \ntrade-offs of the political world that cause conflict of values \n\n\nValue conflict will disrupt partisan stability when an individuals value organization is non-ideological - i.e. it doesn’t quite fit the rhetoric or portrayal by the liberal vs. conservative, left-right spectrum. what makes it non-ideological is that you support values on BOTH sides \nThose that have values the match political elites leads to stable partisanship \nThose that have internalized value organization that doesn’t match elites leads to conflicts of values and partisan volatility. \nElites identify and interpret core values to justify their policy positions \nValues and ideology are traditionally distinct concepts - but values can be distributed along an ideological spectrum"

    "text": "Pattie, Charles, and Ron Johnston. 2000. “People Who Talk Together Vote Together: An Exploration of Contextual Effects in Great Britain.” Annals of the Association of American Geographers 90(1): 41-66.\n\nAbstract:\nMany students of British voting patterns have tested for the existence of contextual effects, which postulate that voters are influenced by events and people in their local milieux. One of those contextual effects is the neighborhood effect, whereby individuals are influenced by the nature of the politically relevant information circulating within their social networks, many of which are spatiallyconstrained to their local area. Although ecological analyses have identified patterns consistent with this hypothesis, there have been virtually no direct investigations of the effect, largely because of the absence of relevant data. Using information from a large, clustered survey of voters at the time of the 1992 general election, this paper uncovers clear evidence of such effects: people are much more likely to change their votes in a particular direction if those with whom they discuss political issues support that direction, especially if they are members of the respondent’s family and are the individuals with whom they discuss politics most.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nWho we talk to is as important as who we are and who we talk to is very much influenced by where we live — we are what we are, and do what we do, because of where we are, and have been OR those who talk together tend to vote together.\n\n\nResearch Question:\nDoes the neighborhood effect have an impact on voter decisions?\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nMost researchers have accepted that voters are influence by their immediate social and geographical environments as well as their own individual circumstances. However, the way in which such contextual factors operate is contested. Most explanations point to spatial variation in economic and political contexts and the driving force behind voter’s decisions. That is, “nonsocial” context on economic and political conditions at the local and national level compose the voting repertoire with which individuals draw on at the polls.\nHowever, the authors speculate that the influence of immediate social networks (family, friends, colleagues) on individual opinions informs their voting behavior. Early research explored such possibilities, but scarcity of data left this “neighborhood effect” to be abandoned if favor of explanations that could be explored.\n\n\nHypothesis:\nMain hypothesis: Each group would be influenced by the dominant nature of electorally relevant information in their social networks—those who changed the party that they supported should be in networks where support for their new party is strong, whereas those who remained loyal to a party should be in networks that give it strong support.\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nExplores contextual effects on voting behavior in Great Britain\nUses data collected in the British Election Study (BES) from the 1992 British General Election, which lends itself to the data requirement of networks of people living in the same locality.\n\nThe data uses a cluster rather than a random sample: 210 “points” (which are polling districts made up of 1,000-2,000 voters).\nUsed a stratified random design with a random sample of respondents selected from the electoral roll for the district\nProduces 2,526 individuals with an average sample size of around 16 per cluster, with a peaked distribution between 16 and 19\n\nAuthors chose to focus on why some respondents, from their own recollection, changed their vote between 1987 and 1992 while others did not\nBy aggregating the reported 1987 votes of each BES respondent by polling district, the authors were able to estimate the vote share there for each of the three main political parties that fought in all British constituencies in both 1987 and 1992: Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat (Alliance in 1987).\nFirst analysis:\n\nContrasts those who switched their vote to a particular party in 1992 (coded 1) against those who didn’t (coded 0)\nGives 3 dependent variables:\n\n1. switch to conservative 2) switch to labor 3) switch to Liberal\n\nEmploys a Logistic Regression (because the DVs are binary)\nThen does the same thing but looks at those who defected (voted for each party in 1987) So those who voted for a particular party in 1987 and again in 1992 (the loyalists) against those that voted for another party/ didn’t vote at all in 1992 (the defectors)\n\nSecond analysis:\n\nlooks at the impact of conversations with the individuals respondents named as the first (primary) discussant of politics and analyzing how that affected transitions to each party\nMeasures those who who didn’t vote for the same party in 1992 as they did in 1987 against those who did\nAlso looks at those who defected versus those who didn’t\n\nThird analysis:\n\nAssesses the degree to which cross cutting relationships impact vote choice by bringing in two additional discussants that the respondents listed\nThe more discussants who support a particular party, the greater the expected probability that an individual will switch to that party, and the less the probability that he or she will defect from it.\n\nFourth analysis:\n\nIt’s possible that discussants don’t live in the same neighborhood (i.e. context) as the respondent. Therefore, there a chance that political context and conversations on voting linked, or could they be separate?\nhypothesize that the more support a party has in a locality (the independent variables employed in the regressions reported in Tables 3 and 4), the greater the probability that individuals there will encounter, talk to, and be converted by that party’s partisans\ntested by dividing the respondents according to how many discussants they report having a particular partisanship, which can vary from 0 to 3.\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nSocial networks are indeed important influences on voting decisions\n\nFamilies who talk together, vote together! (kinda) - voters were more likely to vote/not vote for a party based on conversations they had with their families\nMore accurately: those who talked together tended to vote together.\nConversations with friends are also important\n\nFirst analysis:\n\nthe more their local area was dominated by supporters of a particular party, the greater the probability that individuals switched their support to that party between 1987 and 1992—if they had not voted for it at the first of those two election\nlocal context did not influence voters’ decisions to abandon a party they have previously supported, but that the choice of which party to switch their support to was influenced by local conditions—which is the hypothesized mechanism that underlies the neighborhood effect.\n\nSecond analysis:\n\nThose who did not voter conservative in 1987 were more likely to vote conservative in 1992 if their primary discussant was conservative\n\ntalking to Labour or Liberal party discussants made not conservative voters less likely to vote conservative (duh)\n\nSame results hold for other parties - voters were more likely to vote for a particular party if the primary discussant was a member of that party\nFrequency of conversation about politics appeared to have no influence\nthose people who voted for a party in 1987 were less likely to vote for another party in 1992 if their primary discussant had been a supporter of the same parter when compared to their discussant being from another party or having no discussant at all\n\nThird analysis:\n\nMore likely to support and less likely to defect if the discussants were from the same party\n\nFourth Analysis:\n\nIf a respondent had more discussants from a particular party, then there was also an associated increase in the number of votes for that party in the respondents district\nThis shows that there is a link between spatial and communicative contexts, supporting the neighboring effects.\n\nIt is not logical to ignore social networks, and conversations within them, as a possible influence on the voting decision of individuals\n\n\n\nNon-Findings:\n\nCan’t distinguish if the influential conversations are locally based\nThey know that the conversations matter, but they have no information on the relative locations of the individuals involved in those conversations (how immediate are they?).\nAlso don’t know what the content of the conversations were"

    "text": "Benton, A. L. (2005). “Dissatisfied Democrats or retrospective voters?”, 38(4), 417–442.\n\nAbstract:\nThis article examines recent trends in #Latin-American #voting-behavior and casts them in terms of sincere (economic) and strategic (electoral) concerns. It argues that thanks to years of economic adversity, Latin Americans have developed long, sophisticated #economic-memories . Although this has resulted in rising frustration with democratic government, according to recent opinion polls, it has not always led voters to #punish all parties responsible for hardship at election time. A panel study of the region’s presidential systems demonstrates that citizens punish incumbents by voting for established #nonincumbents when electoral laws reduce opportunities available to small parties in the systems, even if #nonincumbents have also been blamed for hard economic times. More #permissive-electoral-systems , in contrast, encourage citizens to reject all parties responsible for economic decline. The analysis demonstrates how economic and electoral concerns interact to affect voting behavior, #political-accountability , and #public-opinion in Latin America.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nEconomic Evaluations Voter Laws Voter Behavior\n\n\nResearch Question:\nIf most Latin Americans have faced economic hardship during successive governments, why do they reject both the incumbent and non-incumbent parties in some systems and only the incumbent party in others?\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nMany Latin American economies have experienced some form poor performance that has resulted in different forms of electoral punishment. Barton, drawing on previous literature regarding economic theories of voter behavior, devises a theory that enables her to assess the institutional features that interact with economic performance to determine who voters choose to punish in subsequent elections. In highly permissible systems, where there are more parties to choose from, voters memories of economic performance can interact with electoral strategies to allow the punishment of multiple parties (as has been the case in multiple countries). However, more restrictive systems, which limit the number of viable parties, forces voters to focus their punishing efforts on the incumbent alone, as they require an alternative option of some form and therefore increases support for the form incumbent.\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\npanel data from 13 Latin American Countries\n\nrequired (a) to be a presidential system and have had (b) more than one party win the presidency, so that current and former incumbents compete; (c) to have elections deemed free of fraud by international observers, so that their results reflect voters’ reactions to party performance; and (d) to have an economic crisis and/or economic reform during democratic rule.\nin these countries, 64 elections were held, with 39 instances in which current and former incumbents competed for power\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Variable:\neconomic performance as measured by the percentage change in GDP per capita during each parties last 2 years in office.\n\n\nDependent Variable:\n\nChange in support for incumbents - measured as the difference between votes received by an incumbent party in presidential elections while in office and votes received in the previous election when the party won.\nChange in support for non-incumbents out of power - measured as change in support received in elections after leaving office and support when the party originally came into power.\n\n\n\nModel:\n\nUses OLS with #panel-corrected standard errors #PCSEs , which were selected because of the limited number of countries and small (often unbalanced) number of observations in each panel.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nH1: When incumbent parties are blamed for poor economic performance, they will lose support, regardless of the electoral system used to elect them.\nH2: Nonincumbent parties previously in power will derive greater electoral benefits in restrictive, compared with permissive, electoral contexts when incumbent parties are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.\nH3: Former incumbents blamed for economic decline will continue to receive lower levels of support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts, all else being equal.\nH4: Current incumbents will gain support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts when former incumbents are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis\nSupport\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nH1\nYes\nincumbent parties’ support decreases with economic downturns, without regard to institutional change (p.430)\n\n\nH2\nYes\nwhen electoral laws construct institutional barriers to small parties (restrictive), groups once holding the presidency will suffer losses in support when incumbents manage economic growth; as GDP declines, parties previously in power begin to experience a surge of supprot (p.431)\n\n\nH3\nYes\naccounting for the presence of Honduras, there was no relationship between poor economic performance and punishment of former incumbents in restrictive systems; there was a relationship between poor economic performance and the punishment of incumbents in permissive systems (pg.436)\n\n\nH4\nYes\nnonincumbents’ performance has implications for incumbents’ support. As predicted, incumbents gain about 10% of the national votes when nonincumbents are responsible for neoliberal economic reform in all electoral settings\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Findings:\n\nRestrictive institutions reduce the incentive for voters to waste support on parties unlikely to win.\nRather than helping nonincumbents weather the electoral effect of incumbents’ economic growth, runoffs cause nonincumbents to suffer additional electoral losses."

Ch. 27: 518-537.\n\nBumper Sticker:\nThe state of the economy can help predict voter decisions.\n\n\nPurpose:\nThis is a literature review on micro-level, survey research studies of economic voting in the U.S., Britain, France, and Globally.\n\n\nOverview:\nQuestions regarding the precise nature of economic voting led to four general “types”.\n\nRetrospective Voting\n\nOriginating with V.O. Key (1966), this type of voting occurs when voters review the performance of the incumbent government.\n\nProspective Voting\n\nOriginating with Downs (1957), this type of voting occurs when voters look to the future and vote according to the governments potential economic performance.\n\nPocketbook Voting (personal finances)\n\nThis theory of voting suggests that when personal or household financial conditions have deteriorated, voters will punish the incumbent.\n\nSociotropic Voting (national economy rather than personal finances).\n\nThis theory of voting suggests that voters are more likely to be considering the national economic situation when casting their vote.\n\n\nOf these types, the retrospective sociotropic and prospective sociotropic appear to be the most relevant across empirical evaluations. That is, people tend to vote based of their perceptions of national economic performance, both in the past (retrospective sociotropic) and the future (prospective sociotropic). The type of voting that is cued depends on whether or not an incumbent is running, and therefore a reliable place to point blame. Essentially, the reward-punishment hypothesis holds up across settings, with slight variation according to group membership (party id, gender, etc.), institutional context (voting system, prime-minister v. president, number of parties) and economic context (personal, neighborhood, national).\n\n\nFindings:\n\nUnited States:\n\nANES is good source for election studies\nMost theories of economic voting focus on the U.S.\nPocketbook voting is weak in presidential elections -- sociotropic is strong\nStrength of economic voting can cary based on context -- such is the case when considering the attribution of responsibility (e.g. the attribution of blame to particular party/candidate/branch of government)\n\nin the U.S. the presidency is an important institutional context for which to blame punish electorally\n\nWhile other types of factors matter and interact them, sociotropic economic effects (both retrospective and prospective) themselves cannot be understated when assessing the general behavior of the voter population.\n\n\n\nBritain:\n\nBES is a good source for election studies\nBritish voters show the same trends of reward and punishment regarding economic voting\nThere may be important regional contexts\n\nJohnston 1997 finds that when voter’s perceptions of their neighborhoods are that they are worse off, they will punish the incumbent\n\nRetrospective and Prospective are both important\nPerceptual shifts in economic conditions are almost as great as realigning with a different party (Clarke et al. 2004)\n\n\n\nFrance:\n\nEurobarometer and FNES are good sources for election studies\nA general finding—significant retrospective sociotropic effects, but no retrospective pocketbook effects\nIt is largely sociotropic and more or less equally retrospective or prospective, depending in part on the institutional context.\nThe French voter is sophisticated, knowing whom and how much to blame.\n\nWhen government is unified, the president is the lightning rod for economic discontent. However, under cohabitation, the burden shifts to the prime minister.\n\nSmaller parties are blamed less than large parties, legislative candidates are blamed less than presidential candidates, and presidential candidates who are prime minister are blamed more than presidential candidates who are not prime minister.\n\n\n\nCross-National Studies:\n\nSimilar trends have been found in cross-national studies\n\nLewis‐Beck and Mitchell (1990), on the five major western European countries; Chappell and Veiga (2000), on thirteen western European nations; Pacek (1994) and Tucker (2001) on central European samples; Remmer (1991) on twelve Latin American countries; Pacek and Radcli (1995) on eight low‐income nations; Wilkin, Haller, and Norporth (1997) on a worldwide sample of countries.\n\nImportant Takeaways:\n\nResponsibility Hypothesis seems to hold - that when responsibility is hard to pin down, voters are less likely to punish incumbents - this is an important contextual factors\n\nSuch is the case in more countries with more “coalitional complexity” -- when more parties make up the incumbent government, is it difficult to assign blame\nPresidential Systems and systems with more restrictive electoral laws tend to strengthen the economic vote\nIn the context of globalization, there is a significant decrease in economic voting in the face of open trade, as electorates can’t assign blame to the government alone"

But if these slow attitudinal changes are happening across the majority of the population, how do we account for democratic backsliding and the rise of violence against minorities in postindustrial countries following exogenous shocks/social strains? (think terrorist attacks, economic shocks like the 2008 recession, mass migration/immigration from Syria, etc.). Do we think that these represent latent variables that were always present? Are they blips along a long-term progressive path? Or do they represent something more insidious?\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nThis book sets out to understand how modernization has changed cultural attitudes toward gender equality and to analyze the political consequences of this process\nCore arguments: people’s lives have been changed in 2-stage modernization process:\n\nShift from agrarian to industrialized societies\nMove from industrial to postindustrial societies\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction – Explaining the Rising Tide of Gender Equality\n\nWomen’s progress worldwide uneven – lagging in government representation\nUN encouraged states to recognize women’s rights through Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 1979\n\n“...the role of the state is now widely understood to be central in actively consolidating and reinforcing gender equality” (7).\n\nCultural barriers: perceptions of appropriate division of roles in home and family, paid employment, and political spere shaped by predominant culture – the social norms, beliefs, and values in society\n\nThes norms, beliefs and values rest on levels of societal modernization and religious traditions\nGender = the socially constructed roles and learned behavior of women and men associated with the biological characteristics of females and males\nCultural change not sufficient itself for gender equality but is a necessary condition for gender equality\n\nModernization brings systematic, predictable changes in gender roles in 2 phases:\n\n\n\nIndustrialization → women into paid workforce → reduced fertility rates, increased literacy and greater educational opportunities → greater female participation in representative government (but still less power than men)\nPostindustrialization → women rise in management and professions → women gain political influence in elected & appointed bodies (over half of women worldwide haven’t entered this phase yet)\n\n\nChanges probabilistic, not deterministic (11)\n\n\n\nChapter 2: From Traditional Roles toward Gender Equality\n\nFour major predictions – expect to find systematic differences in cultural indicators of gender equality:\n\nbetween societies based on their level of economic development\nwithin societies based on generational cohorts\nbetween women and men, and\nwithin societies based on structural and cultural factors such as education and class\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chapter analyzes indirect attitudinal evidence\nThis study develops a Gender Equality Scale by combining 5 items from the pooled 1995-2001 World Values Surveys/European Values Surveys\n\nMENPOL Q118: “On the whole, men make better political leaders than women do.” (Agree coded low) (1990-2001 WVS/EVS)\nMENJOBS Q78: “When jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women.” (Agree coded low) (1990-2001 WVS/EVS)\nBOYEDUC Q119: “A university education is more important for a boy than a girl.” (Agree coded low) (1990-2001 WVS/EVS)\nNEEDKID Q110: “Do you think that a woman has to have children in order to be fulfilled or is this not necessary?” (Agree coded low) (1981-2001 WVS/EVS)\nSGLMUM Q112: “If a woman wants to have a child as a single parent but she doesn’t want to have a stable relationship with a man, do you approve or disapprove?” (1981-2001 WVS/EVS)\n\nPrincipal component factor analysis revealed that all 5 items tap a single dimension (see Table 2.1) w/Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.54*\n\n\nGender Equality Scale summed across items & standardized to 100 points\n\nMean score for postindustrial societies = 80%; 68% for industrial; 60% for agrarian\n\n\nFigure 2.2: plot of logged GDP per cap vs. Gender Equality Scale; R2 = 0.54"

When such is the case, both men and women have an incentive to cultivate their outside options by entering into paid work, and the distribution of unpaid work is determined by bargaining powers dependent upon the political-economic factors outside the family.\nWhat is important is that divorce is an option that varies across contexts. In places where divorce is a more viable, then outside options become important for long-term welfare. Meaning that both sexes will prefer social and economic policies that maximize these options, even if it reduces household income or other measures of aggregate welfare.\nMen are disincentivized to support their wives working because 1.) it increases her agency/options to exit the marriage and 2.) increases the amount of work he has to do in the home. Additionally, women in specific skills economies typically bear a bigger penalty for career interruptions such as for child rearing, they face more limited work opportunities and may invest less in their market-relevant education as a result. This, in turn, weakens their bargaining power at home, and they get stuck sweeping floors more of the time than their counterparts in economies that specialize in general skills. This occurs unless the government steps in and adopts policies to counter the disadvantages of women in specific skills countries. This is where the gender gap in preferences enters the story."

    "text": "Lyons, J., Utych, S.M. 2023. “You’re Not From Here!: The Consequences of Urban and Rural Identities.” Political Behavior 45: 75–101.\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Rural and Urban identities exist and influence preferences in predictable ways”\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nTo what extent do urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race?\nAre these identities consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world?\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nAs the American political landscape becomes increasingly divided along urban–rural lines, it raises the prospect of deepening social identities that are tied to one’s community-type. As community-type becomes an important social identity, it can lead to favoritism of one’s community in-group, or denigration of one’s community out-group. We explore the extent to which urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race, and whether they are consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world. Using national survey data, we demonstrate that people in both urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors which are correlated with the urban–rural divide. We use two different experiments to assess the consequences of this identity, finding that there are distinct effects in the political arena when allocating government resources, and in the non-political world when judging hypothetical job applications. These effects are generally smaller in magnitude than other factors, such as partisanship, but suggest that community-type identities are important in politics.\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nLyons and Utych set out to assess what appears to be a growing divide between rural and urban party affiliation and voting patterns.They explore the extent to which people use information about rural and urban community types to form impressions about American politics, as well as how people use this information to make decisions about political and non-political matters. If people are using urban and rural identities in similar ways to partisanship, and partisanship uses group identity as a way of perceiving the world, then there is a chance that people may be using geographic information such as urban and rural community type to evaluate the political and interpersonal landscape around them.\nThey focus on discriminatory behaviors. If urban and rural community types are taking on the qualities of social identities, then the in-group and out-group processing of information along lines of community type should be salient. That is, those from urban (rural) locations should confer a preference to urban (rural) locations/people, and a penalty to rural (urban) locations/people when making decisions that allocate resources, benefits, or opportunities.\n\n\nData/Methods:\nUses three different studies\n\n\nFirst Study:\n\nFirst, uses National Survey Data to show that people perceive values differences between people who live in rural and urban places -- appear to be driven by more than just party or race\n\ndo people who live in rural (urban) areas think that people who live in urban (rural) places are different than them, and do they think that they are getting an unfair shake from government relative to those who live in other community types?\nPew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (Wave 32)\nOrdered logit\n\n\n\nIV:\nwhether the respondents live in urban or rural setting\n\n\nDV:\n\nperceptions of others values\n\nused by creating a dichotomous variable from three survey questions (p.80)\n\nperceptions of government distribution of resources across community types\n\nalso created a dichotomous variable from survey questions (p.84-85)\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Study:\n\nSecond, uses a conjoint experiment to explore where urban or rural identities are consequential for how people distribute resources in a hypothetical political scenario\n\nconducted on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in July 2019.7 We recruited 572 respondents to participate in the study, who were paid $1.25 to participate in a study that took less than 10 min, on average.\n\nover representative of young, liberal, white, educated, male\nFirst, participants were provided a sample pairing of two cities, to familiarize themselves with the task. Participants were told they were in charge of allocating $50,000 in highway funding between two cities. These cities were randomly assigned to vary on three dimensions—location (urban, suburban, or rural), mayor partisanship (Republican, Democrat, or non-partisan), year of last investment (2006, 2012, or 2018), percentage African-American (5%, 20%, or 65%) and average household income ($30,000, $60,000, or $90,000). Each individual completed the practice trial, and then 15 test trials.\nkey variation is based on the “location” variation, allowing us to compare how individuals allocate funding between urban, suburban, and rural areas.\nOne observation for each trial includes city characteristics for City A, while the second observation includes city characteristics for City B.\n\n\n\n\nD.V.\n\nthe allocation decision between City A or City B, which takes a value of 1 if the respondent allocates funding to that city, and 0 if they allocate funding for the other city.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nFind that rural identities influence opinions and that partisans react to urban and rural information in expected ways\nFind that Democrats are more likely prefer urban areas to suburban areas, but not difference in the allocation of resources between Urban and Rural Republicans, however, are more likely to allocate to rural areas\nNo location based preferences for rural respondents\n\n\n\n\nThird Study:\n\nThird, uses a resume experience to test discrimination in a non-political setting, finding that people evaluate hypothetical job applicants more favorably when they are from the same community types\n\nrecruited 1467 respondents via MTurk who live in urban or rural areas13 to participate in the study, who were paid $0.50 to participate in a study that took roughly 2.5 min to complete, on average.\nParticipants shown a hypothetical resume and then asked to rate the applicant on a series of evaluative criteria/ traits\nparticipants had preference for co-location\n\n\n\nExpectations:\n\nurban and rural identities are formative for the way in which people view themselves and others, and it is in ways that go above and beyond race, partisanship, and other demographic or socioeconomic factors\nDemocrats should discriminate in a fashion that confers favor to urban locations or people, while Republicans should show a preference for rural locations or people.\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nBoth urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors\nEach identity has a distinct impact on the political arenas when is comes to allocating government resources\nAlso has an impact in the non-political world when judging job applications\nEffects are smaller than other factors, such as partisanship\nLess educated community residents are more likely to perceive values difference\n\nIn rural places, so are younger people, males, whites, liberals, and non-religious service attenders\nresults are particularly related to rural areas\n\nFor government resources\n\nPeople who are older, more educated, Republicans and very conservative are the most likely to believe that urban area get more than their fair share of resources. By far the largest effect is from ideology (0.57 change in predicted probability across the full range), with partisanship (0.47 change in predicted probability) and age (0.22 change in predicted probability) also resulting in meaningful changes in predicted probabilities.\n\nurban residents appear to have a well-defined out group, but it isn’t rural areas, it is the suburbs"

(the scholars didn’t like the social movements so that is why their theories are rather dismissive of the people that make them up.)\n\nPre 1960 Perspective - In social movements, people lose their individuality and become susceptible to irrational behavior, which may include great bravery and sacrifice for the group, but also uncontrolled violence towards outsiders. Mostly negative view of social movements. \n\n“Crowd-psychological ideas” - Max Weber (charismatic leadership), Emile Durkheim (collective conscience), Gustave Le Bon. \n\nAdorno perspective - “In search for new social anchors, the uprooted and isolated individuals of mass society were seen as easy targets for totalitarian mass movements of the left and right. Such movements were moreover seens as attracting particular types of ‘authoritarian’ personalities.”\n\nMotivated by theories of “mass society”\nRapid social change was seen as breaking down traditional social ties and norms.\n\nTheories of Relative Deprivation - gap between what people get and what they expect and aspire to get on the basis of past trends and comparisons with other groups.\n\nDeprivation leads to frustration and striking out at perceived sources of anger.\n\n\n\n\nResource Mobilization Perspective:\n1960s radical movements changed everything. Mancur Olson’s economic theory of collective action changes everything.\n\nMancur Olson perspective - social movements were interpreted as rational, utility maximizing actors, and new vocabulary. \n\nBasically rat choice.\nEmphasized group solidarity and the integration of individuals into social networks rather than breakdown of social norms and social uprootedness. Not just a bunch of isolated weirdos. - KEY DIFFERENCE FROM CLASSICAL PERSPECTIVE.\nProblems with it: downplays context and just typical issues with rat choice.\n\n\n\n\nPolitical Opportunity Structure Perspective:\nWant more focus on external factors in shaping social movements. Mobilization + classical theories focused on internal factors.\n\nPolitical opportunity structures - argue that variations in the amount and types of social movement activity can be explained by variations in the political context that they confront. \n\nSocial movement structure/existence is related to factors such as electoral volatility, composition of party system, inst. Centralization, separation of powers, political elites.\nContrast French protests to Swiss protests. French are bigger because of more centralization.\nStill problematic - diminishes the conception of agency. Opportunities are not decided by external factors but creative individuals that set the plan/agenda. \n\n\n\n\nEvolutionary Model Perspective:\nFocus on interplay of movement-external (environmental selection) and internal (variation/innovation and retention/diffusion) elements.\n\nNew model.\nDoes not require strong assumptions about cognitive or psychological mechanisms that generate strategic decisions of movement activists and their opponents.\nBridge between agency-orientated and structural perspective within social movement research."

Is this the case? Are there examples of VPOs led by women?\nThere also appears to be an assumption that women participate in VPOs for rational reasons such as being victimized, fighting for increased political rights, etc. Outside of Islamic fundamentalism, are there other ways in which women can be radicalized to participate in violence that the study fails to control for?\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nMost studies ignore women’s participation in VPOs\nIf they do examine this phenomenon, it’s through case studies or small-N studies, and focused on “supply-side” dynamics (what characteristics condition women towards violence) rather then “demand-side” dynamics (ways in which different organizational preferences & behaviors work to facilitate or impede women’s presence in VPOs)\n\n“Women’s voluntary participation in violent politics is tied invariably to the availability of opportunities” (489)\n\n3 assumptions:\n\n\nRecruiter and female participants choose purposefully among action alternatives to maximize benefits and minimize costs (everyone thinks like an economist)\nEach organization’s ability to succeed depends on ability to attract and retain members willing to engage in violence\nTo be successful, leaders must be able to persuade potential members to overcome collective action problems while frustrating opponents’ ability to do the same\n\n\nReasons for why women join VPOs mimic reasons why individuals join; that is, they are not particular to women\n\nSupply-side reasons alone not enough to explain variation in participation between men and women in VPOs\n\nCase study: Eritrea (1961-1991) and their war for independence\n\nELF included marginal number of women and mostly in support roles\nEPLF split from ELF & included women in all aspects of org throughout its existence\nAfter victory in war with ELF and major gains in war against Ethiopia, EPLF saw flood of women’s participation\n\nEPLF instrumental in establishment of National Union of Eritrean Women (NUEW) in 1979\nRemained committed to women’s participation"

Instead, the authors explore the content of these events. The goal of the paper is to check the plausibility of tentative thesis - that mass violence can be perceived through a rationalist framework\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nTraditional explanations for why insurgent groups choose to engage is mass violence have focused primarily on ideology as the main explanatory factor. The authors argue that, counter to traditional accounts, mass violence against civilians is strategic with aims of maximizing civilian support. They sketch a theoretical framework for the analysis of civil wars to see how it fares in one particular case: insurgent violence in Algeria. \n\n\nMethod/Finding:\n\nFocus on insurgent violence in Algeria in 1996 during the civil war, which started in 1992 after the Algerian Military (Incumbents) “aborted” the parliamentary election and terminated democracy \n\nThis deprived the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of a sweeping victory and they eventually become outlawed insurgents that formed into two groups - the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) and the GIA (which is believed to have contributed to most of the Massacres. \n\nGeneralized out to other countries at the end of the paper. \nThey find that Massacres tend to happen under conditions of fragmented rule, support for the incumbent state, and escalating violence.\nThey were not random, but attacked specific neighborhoods\n\nFamilies of sympathizers were left alone \nVictims belonged to three groups\n\nLocal opponents who supported incumbents \nPeople supporting competing insurgent groups \nFormer sympathizers who switched allegiance (most targeted this group)\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nMassacre\n\nDefined narrowly as large-scale, face-to-face violence against civilians targeted in groups and in the context of a civil war.\n\nViolence\n\nMeasure in it most basic form: homicide"

Empirical studies following this approach often start with the assumption that certain groups are widely disliked.\nHowever, this method makes it hard to separate tolerance from prejudice in practice.\n\nThe second approach defines tolerance as a positive response to diversity itself, without requiring prior prejudice. \n\nThis view focuses on subjective reactions to diverse values, behaviors, and lifestyles. \nAlthough this conceptualization is analytically distinct from prejudice, previous studies using this definition still rely on measures of prejudice, limiting our understanding of tolerance.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth approaches have methodological issues. They either link tolerance closely to prejudice or fail to measure tolerance in a way consistent with its definition. \n\nAdditionally, previous research has often overlooked the multidimensionality of tolerance and lacks abstraction in its conceptualization and measurement. \nTo address these limitations, the study advances a new conception of tolerance and develops measures consistent with this definition, avoiding the pitfalls of previous approaches.\npropose a new understanding of tolerance as a value orientation towards difference, which focuses on how individuals respond to diversity itself rather than merely putting up with disliked aspects. \nThis definition is abstract and distinct from previous concepts, not requiring the identification of objectionable groups or behaviors. \n\ndraw on Forst’s dimensions of tolerance: \n\nAcceptance\nrespect for difference\nappreciation of difference.\n\nThese dimensions represent different levels of engagement with diversity, ranging from basic acceptance to a deeper appreciation. \nthis approach allows for the measurement of various expressions of tolerance without relying on specific groups or behaviors, making our measures politically and temporally neutral. \nThis framework provides a clearer understanding of tolerance and facilitates its empirical investigation.\n8 positively worded items were selected to capture three dimensions of tolerance: acceptance, respect, and appreciation. \n\n\nDescriptive statistics show moderate to high levels of tolerance among respondents"

Levy, Eds., The Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology, 2nd edition. Oxford University Press.\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Experiences during early childhood are largey  responsible for partisan predispositions and political leanings in adult life” \n\n\nPurpose:\nThis chapter examines the life histories of political orientations as they evolve from early childhood through old age.\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nSears and Brown (2013) employ a life history perspective (framework) to understanding how political orientations evolve across the human lifespan. The use of this framework provides some helpful insights: \n\nIs addresses the constant tension between continuity and change as played out throughout an individuals lifespan\nIt helps us to understand the origins of orientations that are politically consequential among adults, whether concerning politics specifically or intergroup relations. \n\n\n\nFindings:\nThis review has suggested that partisan predispositions are most likely to be acquired in early development, if not quite as uniformly early as originally thought.\n\n\n\nThe authors suggest that this is due the role of “time” which is treated as an independent variable that takes three forms\n\nThe persisting effects of early experiences\nThe major events or “the times” that characterize the environment an individual has experienced \nThe life stages of development - children, adolescents, adults all have different cognitive capabilities \n\nBased on the various ways fo thinking about time, the authors pose four alternative models of the full political life cycel that are often contrasted in the literature and which speak to Campbell’s conception of party identification being shaped by early learning behavior, persistence, and later influence on voting behavior. \n\nfour alternative models of the full political life cycle have often been contrasted: \n(1) persistence: the residues of preadult learning persist through life; \n(2) a variant, impressionable years: orientations are particularly susceptible to influence in late adolescence and early adulthood, but tend to stabilize thereafter\n(3) its major alternative, lifelong openness: individuals remain open to influence throughout later life, including by “the times”\n(4) life cycle: people show distinctive specific propensities at different stages of life (this one is particularly difficult to pin down)\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nThe Life-History Perspective\n\na theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Things:\n\n\n\nThe life history perspective of political development is a theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time. This perspective views political development as akin to the life cycle of an organism, with distinct stages of growth, maturation, decline, and potential renewal.\n\n\n\nKey features of the life history perspective of political development include:\n\n\n\nStages of Development: Similar to biological life cycles, political systems are seen to progress through various stages of development. These stages may include periods of consolidation, expansion, crisis, and transformation. Each stage is characterized by specific challenges, opportunities, and dynamics.\nAdaptation to Environmental Pressures: Just as organisms adapt to their environments to survive and thrive, political systems must adapt to changing societal, economic, and environmental conditions. This may involve institutional reforms, policy adjustments, or shifts in political strategies to address new challenges or opportunities.\nResource Allocation and Trade-offs: The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resource allocation and trade-offs in political development. Political systems must allocate scarce resources, such as financial capital, human capital, and political capital, among competing priorities and objectives. Decisions about resource allocation may have long-term implications for the trajectory of political development.\nReproduction and Inheritance: Political systems often inherit institutional legacies, cultural norms, and social structures from previous generations. These inherited traits shape the opportunities and constraints faced by contemporary political actors and influence the trajectory of political development. Similarly, political systems may reproduce themselves through processes of institutional continuity, elite reproduction, and socialization.\nVariation and Diversity: Just as biological organisms exhibit variation and diversity within and across species, political systems display variation and diversity in their structures, institutions, and practices. The life history perspective recognizes that different political systems may follow distinct trajectories of development due to historical legacies, cultural norms, and contextual factors.\nAdaptive Responses to External Shocks: Political systems may face external shocks and disruptions, such as economic crises, wars, or natural disasters, that necessitate adaptive responses. The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resilience and flexibility in responding to external shocks and maintaining political stability and legitimacy.\n\nPartisanship is apparently a really salient predictor of mate choice lol"

    "text": "Tajfel, Henri. 1982. “Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations.” Annual Review of Psychology 33(1): 1-39.\nAWFUL READ! NEVER WRITE A LIT REVIEW LIKE THIS GUY!!!!\nI did my best to try to take the major themes of each section but he just throws every possible research paper on the subject at you. Literally a whirlwind of information.\n\nIntroduction:\nIntergroup behavior: “Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, collectively or individually, with another group or its members in terms of their group identification, we have an instance of intergroup behavior.”\n\n\nWhat is a group?:\n\nexternal : outside designations. Ex - bank clerks, hospital patients, etc.\nInternal: “group identification” \n\nTo achieve “identification” \n\ncognitive - awareness and membership \nEvaluative one - awareness is related to some value connotation\nEmotional investment in awareness and evaluations. \n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Process in Intergroup Behavior:\n\nFrom Individual to Group Impressions\n\nHow cognitive structures determine certain aspects of intergroup attitudes.\n\nWe are trying to understand cognitive processes and relate it to interpersonal behavior.\n\nDiscussion of stereotypes \n\nCognitive mechanism: since members of minority groups often represent “infrequent” stimuli and therefore a conjunction of their relatively rare appearance with some of their actions lends itself to the construction of “illusionary correlations” and thus to stereotyping.” \n\nSolo status research: When an individual is not part of the group or they are “solo” (think Black man with a group of white men), the Black man will have polarized evaluations compared with evaluations of the same person identified as belonging to the majority group. Aka more variation in view of Black man from white colleagues compared to less variation in view of white guy by white colleagues. \n\nNote: this is not equal across group identities. Some groups still face this issue more than others when the group is mixed. Seems kind of like a primitive concept of intersectionality being developed. \n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Membership and Intergroup Behavior\n\nThe Scope and range of Ethnocentrism\n\nSumner coins term\n\nAlso develops ingroup/outgroup\nArgues ethnocentrism is universal\n\nNot exactly true \n\nGenerates questions that ask about conditions that give rise to ethnocentrism \n\nIn sum, “which differences are emphasized under what circumstances appears to be flexible and context dependent; this flexibility permits individuals to mobilize different group identities for different purposes.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Development of Ethnocentrism\n\nLots of debate \nChildren adopt status + image of their group from outgroup (sometimes) \n\nTension between status development from perception of both ingroup and outgroup\n\nThe growth of group self respect in underprivileged minorities, closely related to socioeconomic, political, and psychological changes both inside the group and outside of it, would result in a corresponding decrease of ingroup devaluations and of low comparative expectancies. \n\nLong process. \nSociopsych transformation is the effect of socioeconomic and political change. \n\n\nIntergroup Conflict and Competition\n\nInterpersonal and intergroup behavior\n\nTwo different approaches \n\nThe “interpersonal extreme” defined as interaction between two or more individuals which is very largely determined by their individual characteristics and the nature of the personal relations between them - Deutsch\nThe “intergroup extreme” defined as interactions which are largely determined by group memberships of the participants and very little-if at all-by their personal relations or individual characteristics. - sherif \n\n\nIntergroup conflict and group cohesion\n\nDoes conflict promote greater cohesion inside the groups engaged in it? At the limit, can conflict create a cohesive group where only a loose structure existed before? \n\nYes, but conditions. \n\nWhat happens if all members of a group are not equally affected by the conflict?\nOr when the consensus about threat, when it is dubious, cannot be transformed by the leadership into an “authoritatively enforced cohesion”?\nOr if a group is unable to deal with threat or to provide emotional support? \n\n\nThere is a connection between in group cohesion and intergroup conflict\n\nPower and status in intergroup behavior \n\nInitially a peripheral focus in the field. But gaining steam. Four research trends \n\nFunctioning of minorities\nThe experimentally induced effects of intergroup power relations \nThe effects of status on intergroup attitudes \nRole played in intergroup behavior by the perceived illegitimacy and/or instability of social differentials. \n\n\n\nSocial categorization and intergroup behavior \n\nSocial categorization: cognitions, values, and groups \n\nStereotypes are categorization.\n\nCognitive function: resulting in the accentuation of similarities and differences, was the utilization of the category membership of individual items for ordering, systematizing, and simplifying the complex network of social groups confront individuals in their social environment\nValue functionL resulted in a still more emphatic accentuation of these same, similarities and differences when they were associated with subjective value differentials applying to social categories. \n“As a result of the categorization process, within-group differences become minimized and between-group differences become exaggerated”\n\nSalience of identity? \n\nThe value and cognitive functions of social accentuation provide a basis for the understanding of the structure and direction of biases in intergroup attitudes and stereotypes, but they cannot tell us very much about the contents of the groups’ reciprocal conceptions. \n\n\nSocial categorization and intergroup discrimination\n\nBoys and holiday camp experiment. Once boys found out about other groups existence they started to form ingroup-outgroup identities before anything started. \n\nWhat are the minimal conditions that would create intergroup discrimination? \n\nCommon fate\n\nSocial identity and social comparison \n\nSocial identity is defined as “the part of the individuals’ self-concept which derives from their knowledge of their membership of a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional significance of that membership.” \n“The social group is seen to function as a provider of positive social identity for its members through comparing itself, and distinguishing itself, from other comparison groups along salient dimensions which have a clear value differential”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reduction of Intergroup Discrimination:\n\n\nIntergroup Cooperation and superordinate Goals \n\nIntergroup cooperation leads to less discrimination than intergroup competition. \n\n\n\nIntergroup Contact\n\nIt is just like one paragraph? IDK not much discussion. \n\nIf you want to know more about this stuff check out more modern literature from Ryan Enos (in my opinion -Stone) \n\n\nMultigroup Membership and “Individualization” of the Outgroup  \n\nTribes provide evidence of this\n\nCrossing of memberships\n\nSome research shows a reduction of discrimination\nThis breaks up the homogeneity of the outgroup."

Ch. 1-3.\n\nBumper Sticker:\nPolitical Participation is important for democracy\n\n\nPreface:\n“The characterization of The Civic Culture as celebrating popular apathy came out of a popular mood that extended into academic circles, which accorded little importance to the policy-making and performances side of democratic government. It overlooked the fact that democracy not only required popular participation but that elected leaders had also to govern, and that governing required obligation, patience, and trust. It was this necessary mix of activism and participation with other important ingredients that The Civic Culture celebrated.” (preface) \n\n\nChapter 1: An Approach to Political Culture:\n\nPolitical culture of democracy and the social structures and processes that sustain it. \n\nA new political world culture is developing. \n\n“Participation explosion”\n\n“What must be learned about democracy is a matter of attitude and feeling, and this is harder to learn”. (p.4) \n\nThe Civic Culture:\n\nCombines modernity with tradition\nA culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permeated change but moderated it\n“The working class could enter into politics and, in a process of trial and error, find the language in which to couch their demands and the means to make them effective” (p.6) - kinda reminds me of historical institutionalism. \nIndividuals are not only oriented to political input, they are also orientated positively to the input structures and the input process. \n\nThe civic culture is a participant political culture in which the political culture and political structure are congruent. P.30 \n\n\nWhat is democratic culture? How does it spread? What attitudes and behaviors must be present to create democracy?\nDemocracy is maintained by an active citizenry. More info, more involvement, and a sense of civic responsibility are essential. \nLooks at 5 countries: United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, and Mexico\n\nA bit concerned about these choices. \nThese countries help escape an American focus - I disagree. \n\nPolitical Culture:\n\nRefers specifically to political orientations - attitudes toward the political system and its various parts, and attitudes towards the role of the self in the system. \nPsychological orientation to social objects. \nWhen we speak of the political culture of a society, we refer to the political system as internalized in the cognitions, feelings, and evaluations of its population. People are inducted into it just as they are socialized into nonpolitical roles and social systems. P.13 \n\nThe political culture of a nation is a particular distribution of patterns of orientation toward political objects among the members of a nation. What are those orientations? (see below) \nPolitical Orientation:\n\nOrientation refers to the internalized aspects of objects and relationships.\nIncludes three types: \n\n1) cognitive orientation - knowledge and belief about political system\n2) affective orientation - feelings about political system \n3) evaluational orientation - judgments and opinions about political objects \n\n\nWe have classified orientation but we now must classify objects of political orientation. \n\nSystem as general object \nInput objects  \nOutput objects \nSelf as object \n\nCharacterizing political culture is done by understanding the various orientations toward the various objects. The types of political culture according to the authors are: \n\nParochial Political Culture\nSubject Political Culture \nParticipant Political Culture \n\n“In the civic culture participant political orientations combine with and do not replace subject and parochial political orientations. Individuals become participants in the political process, but they do not give up their orientations as subjects or parochials.” p.30 \n“Thus attitudes favorable to participation within the political system play a major role in the civic culture, but so do such nonpolitical attitudes as trust in other people and social participation in general. The maintenance of these more traditional attitudes and their fusion with the participant orientations lead to a balanced political culture in which political activity, involvement, and rationality exist but are balanced by passivity, traditionality, and commitment to parochial values.” p.30\nThe connecting link between micro and macro politics is political culture.\nSurvey of 5 nations - 1000 interviews in each country. Interviews take place in 1959. US takes place in 1960\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Patterns of Political Cognition\n\nRecall the classification types of political culture: Parochial, Subject, Participant. \n\nOf the 5 countries - parochial and subject are rare. \n\n\n\nMeasures of cognitive content and processes:\n\nHow much importance is attributed to national and local government\nAwareness and exposure of and exposure to politics and public affairs \nPolitical information adult population possesses \nMeasure of the readiness of these populations to make choices or entertain opinions about political issues and problems.\n\n\n\nThe impact of government: To what extent do the people in these countries perceive government as having an effect on them as individuals? To what extent do they see their lives as related to the activities of governments? \n\nAmericans and British respondents in the great majority perceive an impact of their national and local governments and ascribe high favorability \nGermans are similar but a larger percentage are more skeptical in saying the governments sometime improved conditions \nItalians attribute high favorability to gov \nMinority of Mexicans attribute significance to the government and is skeptical in the benefits of the government. \nFrom the results the authors say: \n\nUS, Britain, German are bulk “allegiants” \nItaly, and mexico (mainly mexico) are majority subject and parochial. \n\nEducation correlated with awareness of the significance of the government\n\nAwareness of politics: Do people pay attention to political and governmental affairs (even campaigns)?\n\nThe civic culture, as we use the term, includes a sense of obligation to participate in political input activities, as well as a sense of competence to participate. \nEducation correlated with higher interest.\n\nHaving information and Opinions: Can people identify national leaders and can people identify cabinet offices or departments at the national level of government? \n\nGermans, English, and Americans have higher well-informed respondents. \nMexico the worst\nExcept italy, low information high opinions are common\nbritish , American, and germans are more cognitively oriented to the input and output of government\n\nMexicans and Italians are alienated and parochial.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Feeling Toward Government and Politics\n\nGeneralized attitudes toward the whole: toward the nation, its virtues, accomplishments,\n\nSystem affect: see above \n\nNational pride \n\n“Speaking generally, what are the aspects of this country that you are most proud of?”\nItalians have more pride in items not related to politics \nAmericans and British had higher rates of indicating government/political/public policy items. \nGermans are less prideful in politics. More prideful in science contributions, economy, and personal virtues. \nMexicans are interested in politics and have high political pride\n\nIs the Mexican revolution responsible?\n\nBetter occupation correlates with more political pride \n\nExcept in germany and Italy \n\nSuggests alienation from system\n\nBoth have fascist past? \n\n\n\n\n\nOutput affect: expectations of treatment by government and police\n\nAttitudes toward the executive/gov affecting respondents. \nIf expected to treat fairly then we expect favorability to government authority from respondent \nRespondents were asked two hypotheticals \n\nMexicans continually are more alienated\nPolice had high favorability…more than government officials - except in mexico. \n\n\nInput affect \n\nFeelings people have about the agencies and processes involved in the election of public officials and enactment of general public policies. \nConcerned with face-to-face communication.\nMeasures:\n\nHow much do respondents report discussing politics \n\nTalking politics is an active form of politics\n\nMass media is passive \n\nAre people becoming more passive in politics? \n\n\nTalking politics also indicates some sense of safety in political communication."

Does interethnic engagement differ from intraethnic engagement from the perspective of ethnic conflict? What role do civic organizations play in times of ethnic tensions and why?\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nCivil society organizations (both formal & informal) between ethnic communities reduce probability for ethnic violence.\n\n\n\nData:\nAll reported Hindu-Muslim riots in India 1950-1995 in 6 different cities\n\n\nMethods:\n\nQualitative analysis with process tracing\n\nPaired cases where similar stimuli applied to each and different outcomes observed to argue for causality (controlled comparison)\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nAssociational engagement deters ethnic conflict from devolving into ethnic violence between paired cities in study.\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nThere is an integral link between the structure of civil life in a multiethnic society, on the one hand, and the presence or absence of ethnic violence, on the other.\nInterethnic and intraethnic networks of civic engagement play very different roles in ethnic conflict.\n\nInterethnic networks  are agents of peace b/c they build bridges and manage tensions\nIf communities are organized along only intraethnic lines and interconnections with other communities are very weak/nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely\n\nBoth intraethnic and interethnic civic networks can be further broken down into organized and quotidian types based on whether civic interaction is formal or informal\n\nAssociational forms of engagement = formal civic interaction; business associations, professional organizations, reading clubs, film clubs, sports clubs, NGOs, trade unions, and cadre-based political parties\nEveryday forms of engagement = informal civic interaction; family visits, eating together regularly, joint participation in festivals, allowing children to play together\n\nBoth forms of engagement promote peace; their absence or weakness opens up space for ethnic violence\nAssociational forms more influential\n\n\nIndia as case study: much of India’s associational civic structure put into place in the 1920s as movement against the British with 2 goals:\n\nPolitical independence from the British\nSocial transformation of India\n\n\n\n\nEthnicity, ethnic conflict, and civil society \n\nEthnicity = the set to which religion, race, language, and sect belong as subsets in a broad definition of ascriptive group identities\nEthnic conflict = disagreement between different ethnic groups over resources, identity, patronage, and policies; not necessarily violent\n\nEthnic peace = an absence of violence, not an absence of conflict\n\nCivil society = formal and informal societal groups that engage citizens??\n\nThe puzzle\n\nDespite ethnic diversity, some places remain peaceful while others experience enduring patterns of violence. Why?\n\nThe importance of studying levels of variance in independent variables\nFor this project, all reported Hindu-Muslim riots in India 1950-1995 used\n\nUnit of analysis = towns/cities (disproportionate share of communal violence)\n6 cities selected: 3-riot prone and 3 peaceful, then paired\n\nAligarh & Calicut – population percentage pairing\nHyderabad & Lucknow – 2 controls added; previous Muslim rule and “reasonable cultural similarities”\nAhmedabad & Surat – from same state of Gujarat sharing history, language, and culture but not violence (hard test)\n\n\n\n\nThe arguments linking ethnic conflict and civil society (theory)\n\n“The preexisting local networks of civic engagement between the two communities stand out as the single most important proximate explanation for the difference between peace and violence” (374).\n2 mechanisms connecting civil society and ethnic conflict:\n\nCivic networks often make neighborhood-level peace possible by promoting communication between members of different religious communities\n\nSustained prior interaction or cordiality facilitated this\n\nIf vibrant formal organizations serving the economic, cultural, and social needs of the 2 communities exist, the support for communal peace tends to be strong and more solidly expressed\n\nParadox: rural India has far fewer formal associations and the least amount of violence\nSee Figure 1: relationship between size and civic links\n\nN represents # of persons in a village/city\nK represents # of links that must be made to connect everyone\nFor a given level of civic density (in this case, each person connected to everyone else), K rises faster than N\nK = N(N-1)/2\nAssociations link individuals and communities\n\n\n\nOrganized civic networks that are intercommunal:\n\nBetter withstand exogenous shocks\nConstrain local politicians acting strategically that might try to polarize communities for political gain\nAre less violent\n\nThis argument is probabilistic\n\n\n\nEmpirical evidence\n\nSimilar provocations, different responses:\n\nAligarh – riot-prone, Calicut – peaceful; both 36-38% Muslim\n\n1989-1992, Hindu nationalist agitation to destroy Baburi mosque led to violence across India but outcomes above were different\nIn Calicut, politicians of all parties promoted peace; city-level peace committees provided info and constructed forums for individuals to express anger\nHindu-Muslim civic integration runs deep in Calicut\nAssociational engagement ubiquitous in Calicut\nCalicut has vibrant social & educational activities\n\n\n\nCausation and endogeneity\n\nDid communal violence destroy civic networks?\n\nCity of Surat (in Gujarat) had a bad riot after destruction of Ayodhya mosque in 1992\n\nMajority of violence confined to slums\nIn old city, peace committees quickly formed\n\n\nA transformative ideological shift in national politics caused systematic organizational efforts\nIn short-to medium-run, organizational civic order became a constraint on behavior of politicians"

the state has provided housing and welfare historically, but dissolution of these protections has allowed for renewed neighborhood autonomy through grassroots organizations like HOAs and commodity housing estates (CHEs)\n\nUnderstanding neighborhood governance and participation in China\n\nSince late 1980s, Chinese state has provided less and managed less in neighborhoods, leading to altered resident behavior\n\nHousing privatization\nDiversified neighborhoods (by home type) and intensified residential segregation (between rich & poor) in the urban space\nCHEs built by private developers now the primary form of urban neighborhood; typically, gated communities w/communal spaces and facilities and mixed land use\n\nNew concept of “collectivity” based on shared properties and home ownership\n\n\nNationwide Community Building campaign launched in 1990s by central gov’t\n\nCHEs have some autonomy over neighborhood affairs and are managed by HOAs and property management companies (PMCs)\n\nNeighborhood watch\nAmenity maintenance\nEnvironment upkeep\n\nRise of HOAs not a project of democratization or a move toward an autonomous civil society in China, since they don’t have much power in community governance; however, “it is important to recognize that the nascent grassroots activities in these neighborhoods do seek to achieve the common good for the community, and sometimes even challenge local institutions” (1138-39).\n\n\n\n\nDriving forces of neighborhood participation: social capital vs. place attachment\n\nNeighborhood participation = a form of civic engagement that stresses voluntary work and activities aiming to influence neighborhood affairs that are of relevance to a collectivity outside the circles of family and close friends\n\nInclude individual vs. collective, informal vs. formal, political vs. nonpolitical, and cooperative vs. confrontational\n\nThis study looks at 2 forms of civic engagement:\n\nLatent involvement = less active involvement like informal information exchange or subjective involvement like taking an interest in or staying informed about political or societal issues (involved but not engaged)\nManifest engagement = actions intended to influence actual political outcomes by targeting relevant political or societal elites or organizations\n\nModern literature focuses either on the social capital framework or the place attachment framework\n\nThis study combines them!\nBoth are necessary to understand neighborhood participation in the Chinese context, but mechanisms vary across neighborhood contexts and demographics\n\nUrban villages/traditional neighborhoods – less active in social participation and weaker sense of place attachment\nUrban-rural divide in the literature but findings inconclusive\nOther socio-demographics include age, gender, marital status, education, income, years of residence, and home ownership\n\n\n\nData and methods\n\nMixed-method approach combining qualitative study and city-wide survey in Guangzhou\n\nQualitative study:\n\n3 months of ethnographic fieldwork in 2012 including observations in open spaces and in-depth interviews\nInterviewees selected from communal spaces and snowball sampling used\n25 interviews: 14 men, most homeowners, most have lived in neighborhood 5 years or more, age ranges from 30-60\n\nSurvey:\n\n2012 household survey in Guangzhou used multistage stratified random sampling\n1,809 households in 39 neighborhoods (see Table 1)\nBlha\n\n\n\nCase study results:\n\nRelationships among social capital, neighborhood attachment, and neibhorhood participation not straightforward\n\nParticipatory behaviors are contingent on the degree of community social capital (perceived mutual trust and reciprocity among residents) and neighborhood attachment (a sense of home to this neighborhood)\n4 scenarios derived from typology in Table 2:\n\nEmbeddedness = strong community social capital & strong neighborhood attachment\nAnomie = low level of mutual trust among residents but strong attachment to the neighborhood\nIndividualism = both weak mutual trust and weak neighborhood attachment\nVolunteerism = high level of community social capital but low neighborhood attachment\n\n\n\nSurvey results:\n\nLatent involvement significantly associated with strong neighborhood attachment but not social capital (Model 3, Tables 3 and 4)\nManifest engagement significantly associated with community social capital, net of effects of neighborhood attachment and private social capital (Model 6)"

    "text": "Bailard, Catie Snow. 2012. “A Field Experiment on the Internet’s Effect in an African Election: Savvier Citizens, Disaffected Voters, or Both?” Journal of Communication 62(2): 330-344.\nI like this one a lot.\n\nResearch Question:\nDoes the internet influence evaluations of the government and motivate people to organize politically?\n\n\nContributions to Literature:\n\nThis paper tests the internet’s effect at a more antecedent and foundational stage of political behavior. Past literature looks at the internet’s influence after people have already moved to act and organize. \nThe second contribution is methodological. A field experiment can provide direct causal tests. This is a first for this body of research.\n\n\n\nTheory:\nWhy would the internet have an effect on political organization?\n“Mirror-Holding” - The internet enables more people to mirror hold. What does this mean? \n\nThe Internet holds up a mirror for users to better discern and reflect on how their government is actually performing. \nThe global nature of the Internet also opens more panoramic windows that better enable individuals to view how governments function in other countries, particularly the high-functioning democracies that tend to be most visible on the Internet. This provides users with a more realistic and globally consistent scale by which to make comparative evaluations about their own government’s performance. \n\nThe internet provides more information to citizens, from a broader range of perspectives, than would otherwise be the case-thus improving the capacity of citizens to make more informed evaluations of their governments. \n\nReminds me a bit of Kevin Munger supply and demand perspective of youtube. \n\nBy providing a venue to publicly document government’s failure or abuses, often coupled with pictures and videos, individuals more readily link their personal experiences to a much larger, pervasive, and entrenched national trend.\n\n\nHypothesis:\nThis the internet will provide a more robust and different set of information regarding the integrity of the Tanzania election compared to that provided by the traditional media.\n\n\nMethod:\nField Experiment:\n\nFocus: 2010 Tanzania elections \n\nWhy?: 2010 elections were not deemed fully free and fair? \n\nUchaguzi (an internet platform) allowed people to create a visual map of where election abuses were reported - allowing citizens to view and reflect on it. \n\nUnit of analysis: Tanzanian individuals \n\nSubjects were recruited in person at several congregation points in the community of Morogoro. Morgogoro is 120 miles away from the economic capital. 200k population. 200 names were collected. Using random assignment, 70 respondents were given the internet treatment and 70 respondents were given the no-internet control condition. \nSubjects were asked to meet at internet cafes. Pre Surveys were given. Individuals then had access to the internet at the cafe for 2 months. Control group was not given internet time but would gain it after the experiment was over. No restrictions were put on how respondents used the internet. After 2 months, respondents were contacted again for a post survey.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nTreatment group had less faith in a fair election and believed the recount was less fair. \nUsers with facebook accounts were more likely to think the election was unfair.\nTreatment was also more likely to trust the police force.\n***Internet users who became more aware of electoral abuses also may have become less likely to believe that their vote mattered as a consequence. While some protested, others simply stayed home. \n\nThe internet may be a double edged sword. \n\nThe internet can alter the cost-benefit calculus of political behavior by expanding the range of information individuals have regarding their government’s actual performance.\nMembers of the disaffected Internet group were less likely to vote. \n\nShowing internet is not the amazing positive force we thought it was \n\nThis is obvious now but in 2010 not so much! \n\n\n\n\n\nStone’s Thoughts:\nI love this article! The theory section regarding how the internet influences political behavior is really intuitive. I think I have a good understanding for how the internet influenced all of us and how it culminated into Trump and the polarization across the world. Let me (attempt) to explain my perspective. \n\nFor the masses: The internet increased communication and information (duh). As Bailard points out, this changes the cost-benefit analysis for individuals to FORM political opinions. In essence, it becomes easier to engage in politics because it reduces the cost to do so. Information can be obtained so readily and easy that people can engage and it seems Bailard shows this to be the case. As a result, the SUPPLY of voters/individuals interested in politics, increases. \nFor elites: The internet provides a new platform for people to engage in politics. Prior to the internet, the barrier to become an elite was much more difficult. The internet democratized who can be an elite. Youtube, facebook, etc. provided a space for anyone to become an elite. This increased the SUPPLY of elites (look at Kevin Munger’s work). The greater supply of elites introduced greater VARIATION in ideology of the elite class (this is how you get polarization to increase as more and more people are expressing different viewpoints). The increased variation of ideology in the elite class spills over into the information and cues they provide to the masses. Because it is easier to be an elite and share information, the masses now have greater access to the variation in perspectives. In short, there used to be a strong barrier towards becoming an elite, perhaps gated by education, money, network, etc; however, the internet basically allows anyone to become an elite and provide cues to people. \nThere is a greater SUPPLY of informed voters, SUPPLY of elites, SUPPLY of information and that is what might be driving our polarized epoch. \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk."

    "text": "Mishler, William, and Richard Rose. 2001. “What are the origins of Political Trust? Testing Institutional and Cultural Theories in Post-communist Societies.” Comparative Political Studies 34(1): 30-62.\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Micro-level institutional arrangements are the source of political trust.”\n\n\nResearch Question:\nWhat is the source of political trust?\n\n\nPurpose:\nUnderstanding how trust begins is important for the consolidation of new democracies. There are competing explanations for the sources of political trust. Some hypotheses stress exogenous determinants  (these are considered cultural theories) while others stress endogenous determinants (these are considered institutional theories). Both can take micro- and macro-level forms. The authors set out to assess which determinants are stronger.\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\n\n(National Culture): Trust in political institutions varies between countries rather than among individuals according to historically rooted, national experiences embedded in interpersonal structure.\n(Individual socialization): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries according to individuals’ trust in others as shaped by their places in the social structure.\n(Government performance): Trust in institutions varies across rather than within countries in proportion to the success of government policies and the character of political institutions.\n(Individual evaluations): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries in accordance with both individuals attitudes and values and the social and economic positions individuals occupy.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nStrongly support the superiority of institutional explanations (endogenous) of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. \nThe effects of macro-political and economic performance on trust are indirect and mediated at the micro level by an individual’s value-laden perceptions\nContrary to cultural theories, interpersonal trust varies widely within societies and has little appreciable effect on institutional trust at either the aggregate or individual levels\nmicro-institutional hypothesis (Hypothesis 4) is confirmed, and the other hypotheses (Hypothesis 1 through Hypothesis 3) are rejected.\n\nBuilding trust: (p. 56) Trust can be nurtured by improving the conduct and performance of political institutions. Governments can generate public trust the old-fashioned way: They can earn it by responding promptly and effectively to public priorities, rooting out corrupt practices, and protecting new freedoms (Hetherington, 1998, reaches similar conclusions). Political institutions also can earn trust through economic policies that promise and ultimately provide a better material future for the country as a whole.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nData - data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. \n\nAggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with survey data on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. \n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey data (p. 40) analyzed here come from the fifth New Democracies Barometer (NDB V), organized by the Paul Lazarsfeld Society, Vienna, and the seventh New Russia Barometer (NRB VII), organized by the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde.\n\nNDB interviews were conducted between January 1998 and May 1998 in seven Central and East European countries—Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia—and in two successor states of the former Soviet Union, Belarus and Ukraine. \nProfessional survey firms conducted face-to-face interviews using national probability samples of approximately 1,000 in each country. \nIn addition, NRB interviews were conducted in Russia by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion in March 1998 and April 1998 using a multistage national probability sample that yielded 1,904 face-to-face interviews \n\nTo test the effects of both national context and individual differences\n\nPooled the survey data from the 10 countries in a single multinational file of 11,499 respondents.\nEach country was weighted equally as having 1,000 cases, and a variety of macro-contextual and aggregate performance variables were added to the merged data set so that respondents could be analyzed in terms of both their individual attributes and their national contexts.\n\nInstitutional trust was measured using the question “There are many different institutions in the country, for example, the government, courts, police, civil servants. Please show me on this 7-point scale, where 1 represents great distrust and 7 represents trust, how much is your personal trust in each of the following institutions?”\nThen were asked “how much do you trust most people you meet?”\n\n\n\nWhen testing micro theories\n\nFive proxies for political socialization are included in the model: age, education, gender, town size, and church attendance.\nFive political performance measures also are used, including the aggregate index of political corruption and micro-level perceptions of personal freedom, government fairness, political corruption, and government responsiveness to citizen influence.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nCultural Theories - view trust as exogenous to political institutions and are a basic character trait learned early in life.\n\nMicro-Theories - focus on differences in individual socialization experiences as sources of significant variation in political trust within as well as between societies.\nMacro-Theories - emphasize the homogenizing tendencies of national traditions and make little allowance for variation in trust among individuals within societies\n\nInstitutional Theories - view trust as endogenous and as a consequence of institutional performance.\n\nMicro-Theories - emphasize the aggregate performance of institutions in such matters as promoting growth, governing effectively, and avoiding corruption.\n\nThe outputs of institutional trust are assumed to determine individual responses.\n\nMacro-Theories - emphasize that individual evaluations of institutional performance are conditioned by individual tastes and experiences\n\nSuch as whether a person thinks that political integrity or economic growth is more important and whether that individual personally has experienced the effects of corruption or the benefits of economic growth. \n\n\nMacro-Theories - emphasize that trust is a collective or group property broadly shared by all members of a society\nMicro-Theories - hold that trust varies among individuals within a society based on differences in socialization and social background, political and economic experiences, or individual perceptions and evaluations.\nLifetime-Learning Model - A model that integrates early-life socialization and adult learning, thereby allowing direct empirical comparisons.\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nPopular trust in political institutions is vital to democracy, but in post-Communist countries, popular distrust for institutions is widespread, and prospects for generating increased political trust are uncertain given disagreements over its origins. Cultural theories emphasizing exogenous determinants of trust compete with institutional theories emphasizing endogenous influences, and both can be further differentiated into micro and macro variants. Competing hypotheses drawn from these theories are tested using data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Aggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with survey data on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. Results strongly support the superiority of institutional explanations of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. This encourages cautious optimism about the potential for nurturing popular trust in new democratic institutions."

Individuals are negatively impacted by uncivil exchanges on televised political discourse as evidenced by lower trust in government on surveys following exposure.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nMutz and Reeves write that “when political actors engage in TV interactions that violate the norms for everyday, face-to-face discourse, they reaffirm viewers’ sense that politicians cannot be counted on to obey the same norms for social behavior by which ordinary citizens abide” (2). Does this work in the opposite direction? If politicians began treating each other respectfully on televised debates, would we expect to see an increase in political trust and that would translate into greater political participation?\nRelated to the question above – if we assume that academic literature is the dominant civil medium for research-backed discourse, and that this discourse is important for policy change, institutional stability, and informed public participation in politics, how do we amplify its reach?\nIf this study were repeated today, would the results hold? Do we agree that people expect political actors to act civilly toward each other? And if not, is this partly due to the dwindling approval ratings overall of our politicians and our political institutions?\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nTelevision and political trust\n\nRobinson popularized term “videomalaise” in 1975 to refer to attitudes that resulted from watching television news\nEvidence supporting the causal claim that television is responsible for low levels of political trust has been limited\n\nClaims have broadened into general critique of political journalism\n\nMain emphasis of research has been on the extent to which televised politics heightens the importance of personality characteristics in general evaluations of candidates\n\nCandidates’ personal qualities more important to voters who obtained political news from TV (Keeter 1987)\nTV primes people to rely more on personality perceptions when evaluating candidates (Druckman 2003)\n\nSocial psychology theories of human-media interaction suggest that TV political disagreements would exacerbate the “intensification of feeling” Lippmann described in 1925\n\n“When political actors engage in TV interactions that violate the norms for everyday, face-to-face discourse, they reaffirm viewers’ sense that politicians cannot be counted on to obey the same norms for social behavior by which ordinary citizens abide” (2)\nFocus of this study is TV b/c it’s the dominant medium\n\n\nTheoretical basis for videomalaise\n\nTo trust = to assume that a person or institution will “observe the rules of the game” (Citrin and Muste 1999)\n\nPeople expect political actors who appear on television to abide by the same social norms acknowledged by ordinary Americans\nPeople react negatively to incivility (even if it’s on TV)\n\nExperience of political conflict on TV substantially different from real life\n\nNeed for politeness is particularly great when expressing controversial views (Kingwell 1995)\nPoliteness and respect toward individuals involved in a legal conflict enhances their perceptions of fair treatment (Tyler 1990)\n\nTelevision world provides uniquely intimate perspective on conflicts\n\nWhen social norms for civility are violated on TV, viewers’ intimate perspective intensifies an already negative reaction to incivility\nReeves & Nass (1996) show that when motion appears on TV, physiological responses are the same as when motion occurs in the immediate environment – the human brain hasn’t evolved quickly enough to respond in rational ways to technologies such as TV\n\nWhen encountering differences of opinion in person, people tend to downplay differences and maintain a polite, cordial atmosphere\n\nIn contrast, TV emphasizes conflict and strong differences of opinion to enhance dramatic value and attract viewers\nTV is also a highly intimate medium\n\nCentral hypothesis: This violation of social norms should cause negative reactions toward politicians and government\n\nPeople expect others to obey social norms and evaluate them less favorably when they don’t\nGiven that the normative expectation is one of civility, this influence should be primarily a function of negative reactions to incivility rather than positive reaction s to civility\nFurther hypothesize that TV viewers will respond negatively to incivility on TV due to largely gut-level, emotional reactions to violations of social norms rather than a cognitive awareness of excessive conflict\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\n\nProblems with validity and reliability of self-reported media exposure (Price & Zaller 1993), so experimental design used\nCentral manipulation: the extent to which politicians exchanged political viewpoints in a manner that violates the typical norms governing face-to-face political conflict\n\nUsed adults and undergraduates\nExposed viewers to systematically different versions of 4 different political disagreements drawn from a larger pool\n\nManipulated extent of civility and politeness w/o altering political content\nExpectation that when dissonant views were presented in an uncivil fashion, they would encourage more negative, distrustful attitudes toward politics and politicians\n\nProfessional actors hired to play roles of 2 congressional candidates with TV studio/political talk show mock program\nTeleprompters used to hep actors adhere closely to a script\nCandidates assigned opposing views on each issue and interaction was to be civl or uncivil\n\nExperiment 1: free trade, mental health insurance, Internet privacy regulation, and NASA funding\nExperiment 2: tobacco regulation, taxation of retail sales on the Internet, public service experience, and free trade\nExperiment 3: tobacco regulation, Internet taxes, repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, and public service experience\n\nEach edited to 5 min in length\n\n\n2 versions of each exchange taped\n\nCandidates expressed exactly same position in same words in both versions, offered same arguments, but civil exchanges were VERY civil and uncivil exchanges took personal jabs, raised voices, and never apologized (as well as rude nonverbal reactions)\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows results: candidates in uncivil versions of issue exchanges consistently perceived as less polite, more quarrelsome, more emotional, agitated, and hostile\n\n2 null findings: no perceived ideological differences in a candidate’s stand in civil vs. uncivil condition\n\n\n\nProcedures\n\nParticipants sat alone in a room w/a comfy couch and overstuffed chair, coffee table, and 32-inch TV\n\nAfter consent, they filled out a pretest questionnaire\nThen viewed 20 min of TV program featuring same scripted disagreements on 4 different issues\nThen filled out posttest questionnaire\n\nSubjects in experiment #2 not told hypothesis in order to facilitate follow-up interviews by phone\n\n\nExperiment 1 subjects randomly assigned to civil or uncivil conditions (n = 67)\nExperiment 2 included a 3rd control condition where subjects didn’t watch any political TV (n = 155)\n\nControl group included to determine whether differences between civil and uncivil condition swerve due to an elevation of political trust in the civil condition, a decrease in trust in the uncivil condition, or some combo\nThis control group filled out same pre- and posttest questionnaires but watched a non-political program\n\nExperiment 3 used within-subjects design where all were assigned to both civil and uncivil conditions in random order to understand process of influence\nPolitical trust measured from National Election Studies under rubric of support for the political system\n\nResults\n\nData analyzed by testing difference of mean levels of trust in 2 conditions in experiment 1; all 3 trust measures significantly influenced negatively by uncivil exchange (see Figure 2)\n\nPeople differentiated between the importance of public conflict and the civility of that conflict\nUncivil versions perceived to be more entertaining than civil versions"

If so, how?\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\n\nDevelops  a theory that accounts for the variety of ways in which pro- and anti- gay-rights actors engage with the media, which generates clear expectations about how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs.\nThe author argues that increased overall media consumption enhances support for LGBTQs, but that this effect is driven by consumption of newspaper, internet and social media. This is because government censorship of queer content is often directed at television programs that contain positive representations of LGBTQs.\nThe media impacts public opinion of the LGBTQ+ community through (1) exposing individuals to positive representation and (2) exposing individuals to new information in general\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nDifferent types of media produce distinct effects on public opinions of LGBTQ+ people\n\nRadio and television have no significant effect on pro-gay attitudes\nNewspapers, internet, or social media have a positive effect on support\n\nThese effects are conditional on censorship of queer representation from certain mediums \nShow that governments proudly publicize their crackdowns on queer content in TV \n78 %  of respondents report negative attitudes towards homosexuality.\n\nHowever, individuals who consume more media overall are 4–8 %t more likely to express pro-gay beliefs.\n\nThrough content analysis of radio, newspaper and the internet, provide preliminary evidence that the mechanisms driving these effects is increased access and exposure to positive LGBTQ representation.\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nLooks at media consumption across thirty-three African countries. \nmulti-methods approach, which combines cross-sectional survey data with content analysis and descriptive data from across Africa\n\nCross-national survey data from Afrobarometer Round 6 conducted in 2014 and 2015.\n\nEstimates 6 binomial logits \nCountry fixed effects and district-clustered standard errors help to account for country and sub-national differences \n\nOne to look at the impact of an individuals aggregate score across, and then one for each of the 5 mediums \n\nResults hold when replicated using OLS and ordered-probit models \n\n\n\nIV:\n\nquestions in the survey that ask how often the respondent gets their news from five different sources: radio, television, newspaper, internet and social media.\n\n\n\nDV:\n\nprimary dependent variable is a question in the survey that asks how the respondent would feel about having a ‘homosexual’ as a neighbor\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nPolitical leaders across Africa frequently accuse the media of promoting homosexuality, while activists often use the media to promote pro-LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) narratives. Despite extensive research on how the media affects public opinion, including studies that show how exposure to certain information can increase support of LGBTQs, there is virtually no research on how the media influences attitudes towards LGBTQs across Africa. This study develops a theory that accounts for actors’ mixed approach to the media and shows how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs. Specifically, the study finds that radio and television have no, or a negative, significant effect on pro-gay attitudes, whereas individuals who consume more newspapers, internet or social media are significantly more likely to support LGBTQs (by approximately 2 to 4 per cent). The author argues that these differential effects are conditional on censorship of queer representation from certain mediums. The analysis confirms that the results are not driven by selection effects, and that the relationship is unique to LGBTQ support but not other social attitudes. The results have important implications, especially given the growing politicization of same-sex relations and changing media consumption habits across Africa."

    "text": "Aldrich, John H. 1993. “Rational Choice and Turnout.” American Journal of Political Science 37(1): 246-278.\n\nContext:\nRational choice is very popular within the voter turnout field. At the time, people were moving away from RCT, Aldrich argues that it is still useful and can’t help us get closer to explaining why some people vote and others do not. \n\n\nGoal:\nUse rational choice to help us understand why some people vote and others do not. \n\nWe can find variables that increase or decrease the likelihood of turning out. But they never in an absolute sense tell us above. \n\n\n\nThe Basic Model:\n\nPreferences determine behavior \n\nRat choice is about HOW those preferences determine behavior\n\nA citizen’s preferences are realized in the outcome. We infer a voters preference through the action of who they vote for. \n\nCitizens’ preferences are transformed into utilities for outcomes when it matters how much the citizen prefers one outcome over another. \n\nConclusions of basic model: \n\nNever vote for the less preferred candidate\nIf costs of voting are high, always abstain\nIf costs of voting are zero, then vote for A because voting for A dominates abstaining \nIf cost is between 0 and 5, the basic model is silent. Rational choice models of turnout differ over ways to handle these cases. See figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nRat Choice:\nRational choice theories are theories about the (expected) utility associated with outcomes generates or induces preferences for the particular actions at hand. \n\nFundamental is that rat choice argues that whichever outcome has a higher utility (1,0), the individual will choose actions to receive the higher utility outcome. \nActions are instruments to achieve outcomes\nThe action of voting is an instrument to achieve the desired outcome. \n\n\n\nCost of Voting:\n\nVoting is not a costless action. \n\nYou have to obtain information, process it, decide what to do. \nYou have to go to the polls. \n\nSome people say that not voting is costless\n\nAldrich disagrees, rational abstainers must pay cost of deciding to vote or not. \n\nCost of voting is represented as, C\nC &gt; 0 \nWhen costs are high -&gt; voter turnout decreases\n\n“When registration laws were passed, poll taxes were raised, or residency requirements were enacted, turnout fell.\n\n\nVoters must still give some thought to what others might do. That factors into the voters choice to act. \n\nIf the voter thinks that their candidate will lose considerably, they probably will be less likely to vote. \n\nTHE PROBLEM: voters do not know the situation they face.\n\n\n\n\nThe Calculus of Voting Model:\n\nInitially developed by Downs and extended by Riker. \n\nControversial addition to the model. The term D\nD represents the value of seeing democracy continue. If noe voted, Downs argued the political system would fail and thus some vote to ensure the continued vitality of democracy.\n\nRiker continues this - change it to “citizens duty” \n\n\nAdding a D term is the same as subtracting a C term. \n\nMore of a sense of citizen duty can counter the cost of voting. \nD does not change anything unless D &gt; C. \n\nCRITICAL INNOVATION TO CALCULUS OF VOTING MODEL: \n\nEach person assigns a probability of the state of the world being true. \n\nThe probability that one vote will make a difference.\n\n\nCan be summed up through the equation: \n\nR = PB + D - C\n\nIf R is positive, vote for candidate A (voters preferred candidate) if not, abstain.\nR = Rewards \nP = Probability of one vote breaking a tie \nB = difference in utility for candidate A instead of B winning (diff in benefits) \nD = citizen duty\nC = cost of voting \n\nHigher P = higher voter turnout \nC, D, and B are strong predictors of turnout.\n\nProblems with the Calculus of Voting model\n\nD term is hotly debated \n\nIf you vote because “you wanted to” then voting is not instrumental towards an outcome.\n\nRat choices are models of how one acts, given tastes. They are not models of where “taste” comes from. \n\n\nThe P term is not realistic. It is not reasonable to assume your vote will break a tie. \n\n\n\n\nThe Minimax Regret Model\n\nDeveloped by Ferejohn and Fiorina \nReject completing the basic model. \n\nThey argue people’s ability to form probability assessments of the state of the world is basically too difficult and near impossible. \n\nIf these probability assessments cannot be formed, they argue that the calculus of the voting model can not be used. \n\n\nInstead of expected utility maximization, they propose a decision rule called minimax regret\n\nSuppose a voter decided to abstain. Their preferred candidate loses by one vote. That voter would be regretful of their decision. \n\nThus they measure the level of regret \n\n\nMinimax regret refers to taking the action that yields the minimum of these maximum regrets. \n\nThis model differs in what to do on the middle columns as seen in figure 1. \n\nThey argue their model is better than the calculus model and better predicts turnout more often.\nProblems with the Minimax Regret Model: \n\nP term is still an issue \n\nP at least exist but is small \n\nHonestly this was a bit over my head. See page 259 - was confused. \n\n\nSecond issue is the wasted voting undermines the plausibility of minimax regret \n\n\n\n\nA Third Approach - Game Theoretic Accounts:\n\nAldrich the other models have problems \nTho other models are based on decision theory\n\nNo one decision is assumed to affect the decisions of others. \n\nThe decisions of others are highly aggregated \n\n\nGame theory models do not make this mistake and assume that decisions are based on taking others’ decisions into explicit account. \n\nWait but aldrich says that problems in the calculus model are still at least somewhat present in game theory models \n\n????????????????????\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rationality of Turnout:\n\nTurnout is cheap \nInformation gain is asymmetric \nElections differ in salience and impact.\nTurnout is still a collective action problem BUT not a good example. Collective action problems typically assume importance because they are high-cost, high benefit decisions, where small P terms mean that the high B terms are substantially discounted. Turnout is a low cost, low benefit decision and she’s little light on most important collective action problems. \n\n\n\nStrategic Politicians and Rational Choice Turnout:\n\n\nA strategic politician explains why turnout is higher in close elections. \n\nMore investment into close contests and this will be reflected in increasing levels of turnout. \n\n\n\nStrategic politicians inform voters of the wasted-vote argument and convince at least some voters that it is sensible to act ast strategic voters \n\nI forget the name but there is a new book out that discusses how and where candidates go to campaign (physically). He basically finds that campaign events don’t really do anything other than increase turnout."

It moves from research at the aggregate level, including why there is country level variation in voter turnout and finishes on individual level research review and why people vote.\n\n\nIV:\nsocio-econ environment, party system, level of development, electoral rules such as compulsory, institutional structure, importance of election/ Resource model, psychological model, mobilization model, rational choice theory/Generational replacement and lowering of age, fractionalization of party system, declining group mobilization \n\n\nDV:\nWhat accounts for voter turnout variation in the aggregate/individually/why is there a decline starting in the 1990s \n\n\nOutcome:\n\nPatterns and Trends: A total of 533 elections and 106 countries are included. All democratic legislative elections (1972-2004), mean turnout 75% and stable with variation in the 3 points range. Variation in country is around 5 points. No central tendency. Turnout decline over time of 8 to 9 points. Higher in established democracies (29 countries) and slightly higher in presidential elections. \nExplaining Turnout Variations across Countries: Three sets of factors have been identified: the socioeconomic environment, the institutional set-up, and the party system (Powell 1982; Blais and Dobrzynska 1998). Difference between poor and other countries (undistinguishable amongst the wealthy). Compulsory system affect turnout with a 10-15 points higher turnout (not sure if it is about the sanctions). PR and high magnitude, higher turnout /= in Latin America. Important elections and relative power of the seat at stake=higher turnout/ with a caveat (Blais 2000). Higher leverage of lower house predicts best higher turnout. Facility of voting does not produce measurable findings. Turnout appears to be higher when there are less parties in contention. “Closeness” of the results might have an effect. No real consensus on this.\nExplaining the Recent Turnout Decline: three reasons for the 9 points decline since 1990 1) Generational replacement, Degree of competition of the election (Franklin). + voting age lowering is not a culprit , 2) Fractionalization in party system, 3)declining group mobilization (especially where union density has subsided). Not completely set\nThe Decision to Vote or not to Vote: age and education are the two most significant factors, followed by religiosity, income, and marital status (Blais 2000)."

The idea is that if separated powers are bad for turnout, then anything that accentuates this separation should reduce turnout still further. \n\nDivided government as a variable \n\nTurnout in midterm elections is correlated with turnout in the following presidential election more than the association between the previous presidential election. \nIf an elections is felt to be a foregone conclusion, it makes sense less people will vote.\n\nAn inventory of variables affecting electoral competition \n\nExecutive responsiveness \nMargin of victory \nSize of electorate \nTime since previous election \n\nShort term vs. long term effects\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Explaining Turnout Change in Twenty-Two Countries (more substantive chapter)\nThis chapter gets at the main question of: What causes turnout change? Further we can better understand the decline in turnout that has occurred in recent years.\n\nFocus:\n22 countries 1945 - 1999. ONLY look at lower house election data. Authors do not look at presidential elections or midterms.\nFeatures that relate to the utility and costs of voting are the primary motivating forces that drive voter turnout. \n\nOther variables include \nElectoral type \nProportionality of electoral system \nExtent of the franchise \nWhether absentee ballots are permitted \nWhether voting is compulsory \nDistrict magnitude \nElection over weekend \nCloseness of race \nIntervals of election \nSize of electorate \nSize of largest party \nPolarization \nSee page 121 for more.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nWe expect Signficnat effects from the following variables operationalized as short-term factors: time since the previous election, weekend voting majority status of the largest party, margin of victory of the largest party, mean margin of victory across the districts in majoritarian systems, polarization and cohesion of the party system, decisiveness of the election, and disproportionality of the electoral system \nWe expect significant effects from the following variables operationalized as cumulative factors: compulsory voting, absentee voting, female empowerment, extension of the franchise to eighteen year olds, size of electorate, average district magnitude, and the responsiveness of the executive to the political complexion of the legislature \nWe expect a significant effect of past turnout \nWe do not expect any features of the character of elections that can vary over time to prove significant except when operationalized as a short-term or cumulative factor. \n\nH1 mainly involves electoral competitiveness, h2 mainly involves process of generational replacement, and h3 involves inertia. \n\n\nFindings:\n\nAbsentee voting appears to be associated with falling turnout.\n“Character of election” causes significant results on turnout to vary.\nFemale empowerment is signficant \nAverage district magnitude, disproportionality, weekend voting, decisiveness of the political system, polarization of party, proportion of the electorate made up of new voters, whether the government of the day was a coalition were not significant. Their role however maybe subsumed by other variables which may explain why they are not significant. \nFour variables associated with electoral competition have short term effects \n\nSize of the largest party \nMargin of victory \nMean margin of victory (for majoritatarian countries) \nParty cohesiveness\n\nFour variables having to do with instiutiional arrangements have cumulative effects: compulsory voting, female empowerment, young invitations, and executive responsiveness.

The purpose of this article is to more appropriately assess the relationship between collective nostalgia and populism by situating collective nostalgia as a psychological factor that contributes to populism. \n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nFollowing the ideational approach, this study claims that populists aim to facilitate the moralistic separation between the pure people (us) and the corrupt elite (them). While constituting the boundaries of us vs. them, populists create an in-group vs. out-group identity. To this end, one of the primary tools that populists utilize is collective nostalgia. Populists offer their constituencies a golden age – a heartland where corruption, disruptions and enemies do not exist. \nElçi situates populism and collective nostalgia in the context of Turkey, where contemporary secularist and Islamic cleavages exist as a product of structures established under the Ottoman Empire. The cleavage exemplifies the ruling center (secularist elites) and the ruled periphery (the Islamic people).  The ruling center adopted Kemalist beliefs - pushing the country to modernize, become secular, and overall promote nationalism. This push was the result of the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990’s, leaving a power vacuum in the region that was filled by the Kurds . In response to this, political Islam is aggrandizing the Ottoman past as a tool for the reconstruction of “the Great Turkey” today. In this way, they are experiencing Ottoman nostalgia - a desire to return to “the golden days” and become a leader of the Islamic world.  Ottoman nostalgia is much older than Kemalist nostalgia - which began to emerge in the 1990’s following increased pressure by the EU to privatize, as well as increased exposure to the IMF and World bank, which challenged the existing values of the Kemalists. This nostalgia is characterized by ‘the memory of a strong, independent, self-sufficient state and its secularist modernization politics which dominated the public sphere through the past century’.\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe more nostalgic respondents are, the more populist attitudes they will express, because nostalgia creates a ‘pure people vs. corrupt elites’ duality.\nRespondents in the nostalgia treatment groups should be more populist than those in the control group in the experimental setting.\nThe effect of the Ottoman nostalgia treatment on populist attitudes should be greater than the Kemalist nostalgia stimulus in the experimental setting.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nCollective nostalgia has a significantly positive relationship with populist attitudes even after control for various independent variables - such as religiosity, partisanship, satisfaction with life and Euroscepticism\nOttoman nostalgia increases populist attitudes\nKemalist nostalgia has a weak direct effect on attitude that disappears when party preference is controlled for\n\n\n\nMethod:\nUses a representative survey (n=1,954) and experimental datasets\n\nthe  survey tests the link between individuals’ predisposition to nostalgia and populist attitudes (H1)\nDV:Populist beliefs\n\n constructed from four survey items from previous research that Elçi aggregated into an index ranging from 0 (least agreement) to 100 (most agreement)\n\nIV: Nostalgia\n\nConstructed from four different survey items that seek to measure the importance of past values, past experiences, old tastes, and the country’s glorious past\n\nControls: \n\nThree sets of IVs to control for the relationship between populism and nostalgia\n\nsupport for EU membership, satisfaction with democracy, economic conditions, and life, and interpersonal trust questions\nAlevi, Kurdish and religiosity, where the cross-cutting cleavages in Turkish society occur.\nPartisanship, sex, age, education, income, urban residency. \n\n\nCreated 10 different models to control for the effect of nostalgia with party preference and satisfaction with life, democracy, and economic conditions.\n\nAlso performed an experimental analysis\n\ncreated a between-group experimental design in which two groups received different types of nostalgic messages\n\nThese were Ottoman and Kemalist\nAlso used a control group that DID NOT receive any stimulus\n\nData was collected using convenience sampling - respondents were recruited through Facebook and Instagram ads using Qualtrics survey tool\nN = 911 \n\nWere asked a series of warmup questions - such as satisfaction with democracy, lives, and economic conditions \nRandomly assigned them to groups\nIntroduced experimental vignettes \n\nOttoman and Kemalist groups were presented with a message priming them to respond to texts about history of Turkey\nControl group did not receive any message\n\n\ntested the effect of nostalgia treatments on populist attitudes by building a populism index with five items taken from Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove (2014).\nsummed all items and built a scale between 0 and 100, where 100 indicates higher populist attitudes\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nPopulism\n\n(Mudde, 2007) a thin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into to homogenous and antagonistic groups:\n\nthe pure people versus the corrupt elite\n\n\nCollective Nostalgia\n\n(Wildschut et al. 2014) the nostalgic reverie that is contingent upon thinking of oneself in terms of a particular social identity or as a member of a particular group and concerns events or objects related to it\n\nCleavages \n\n(Somer & McCoy, 2019) formative rifts that ’either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nTurkey’s populist Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) exploits nostalgic rhetoric to dominate the country’s politics.\n\nemphasize the glorious days of the Ottoman and Seljukian empires\n\nPopulists frequently emphasize that the elites hijacked the people’s will long ago, and they promise to return power to the people. \n\nAccording to this logic, back in the good old days corrupt elites were not powerful enough to abuse the authentic people.\n\nAccording to populists, the people’s will is the cornerstone of politics \nMany scholars agree that populism appears as a backlash to a sense of severe crisis (Rooduijn 2014; Taggart 2004) or discontent (Spruyt, Keppens and Van Droogenbroeck 2016). \n\nThis sense of extreme crisis paves the way for raising concerns about the present conditions, which is a breeding ground for populism (Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove 2014). \nPopulists blame the establishment for the decline in the people’s economic, political and living standards (Rooduijn, van der Brug and de Lange 2017).\n\nPopulism can also be generated by unsolved, long-lasting and cross-cutting political cleavages within a society. Somer and McCoy (2019, 8) define these cleavages as formative rifts that ’either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime\nNostalgia is a yearning for the past \n\nAccording to Strauth and Turner (1988) it has four component parts\n\nFirst, ‘there is the view of history as decline and loss, being a departure from some golden age of “homefulness”’. \nSecond,  is the problem that there exists ‘a sense of the loss of wholeness and moral certainty’. \n\nAt this point, ‘history is seen to be a collapse of values which had once provided the unity of social relations and personal experience’. \n\nThe third is related to ‘the loss of individual autonomy and the collapse of genuine social relationships’. \nLast but not least, nostalgia is ‘the sense of a loss of simplicity, spontaneity, and authenticity’\n\nNostalgia, or the way we remember our past, exacerbates in-group vs. out-group distinctions (Martinovic et al. 2018). \nNostalgia also strengthens shared social identity and distinguishes the in-group from other groups (Brown and Humphreys 2002; Wildschut et al. 2014).\n\nThe rise of populism is closely related to ‘acute despair at the present moment and a memory of a previous golden age’.\nThe golden age corresponds to the heartland in populist literature. \n\nCoined by Taggart (2004, 278), ‘the heartland is a construction of the good life derived retrospectively from a romanticized conception of life as it has been lived’. \nIt involves returning to the pre-lapsarian world, a Golden age before a catastrophic lapse or fall: in the post-lapsarian era, individuals feel lacking, deficient or oppressed (Tannock 1995).\n\nIn Turkey, secularists and Islamist cleavages exist\n\nThe secularists can be thought of as the elites and appear to be supported by the left\n\nthey have dominated Turkish politics and society as guardians of the Kemalist values\n\n The Islamist’s are the people, representing the ruled and appear to be supported by the right (Çarkoğlu 2012; Çarkoğlu and Hinich 2006).\n\nExpectations that impacted Control variable selection: \n\nThe author expects that the more dissatisfied respondents are with their lives in general, subjective economic conditions and democracy, the more populist attitudes they will have.\nReligiosity plays a pivotal role in explaining the party preferences of the Turkish constituency and is a key independent variable for explaining the center–periphery cleavage.\n\nTherefore expects more religious respondents to display more populist attitudes.\n\nExpect Alevi respondents to have less populist attitudes because they are more supportive of secularism.\nExpects that Kurdish respondents will have more populist attitudes because they are more critical of the Kemalist establishment.\nThe Peoples’ Democratic Party (Halkların Demokratik Partisi, HDP), as a radical democratic pro-Kurdish party, should also display more populist attitudes\nexpect CHP and Nationalist Action Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, MHP) voters to have less populist attitudes since they represent the status quo."

Chapters TBD.\nChapter 1:\n\nResearch Question:\nWhy do people vote for radical right parties? Why do certain people at certain times in certain places decide that a radical right party or candidate merits their electoral support? \n\n\nFocus:\nEurope, North American, Oceania \n\nMainly Switzerland and France\n\n\n\nLiterature insights: \n\nOriginally, social group based voting was powerful and pervasive. The left had unions and the right had churches; these were stabilizing forces. \n\nHowever, as membership in unions and churches and their attendant social groups wanes, support for mainstream left and right parties becomes less socially rooted in a traditional sense and less habitual. \n\nInstead of approaching elections from particular social positions, people now make choices at the polls that are motivated by attitudes on specific policy issues and attraction to particular political leaders. \n\n\n\nLocalist Theory of Radical Right Voting: an account of unconventional electoral behavior that is motivated by people’s feelings of attachment to their local communities \n\n\nMain Argument:\n“I argue that those individuals with the strongest sense of belonging to their localities find the programs of radical right parties particularly appealing.” \n\nAll politics is local - Tip O’Neill\nLocal attachments underpin and motivate radical right support\n\n\n\nLocalism: \n\nSmall scale communities can offer a sense of belonging and a sense of place; research in psychology bears this out. \nGlobalization has changed things. \n\nAs globalism has increased, the importance of the local has grown in response. \n“Modern life has not erased the importance of place…It may have, instead, increased the need for people to draw boundaries, to more crisply define their geographic community…and to behave in ways that signal their place-related identities…People are often proud of where they are from, and they continue to want you to know it. (Cramer 2016: 240, fn. 12) \nGlobalization pushes people to invest reflexively in their local areas, it also threatens to undermine what makes each locality special. Pg 6 \n\nEric Hobsbawm: The impersonalizing forces of globalization push people to invent mental connections to social groups, thereby reinforcing the rise of identity politics. \n\n\n\nWhat is the typical right winger?\n\nMAN \nLow socio-economic status \nTypically holds negative view of modern developments \n\nImmigration, outsiders ruining “the way it was” \n\nTrad dudes. \n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting insights: \n\nHigh Social Capital negates the typical right winger. \n“Straddling the individual-aggregate divide are accounts informed by theorist of social capital; the argument is that individuals who invest in social capital (through the participation in civil society) and those communities rich in social capital will not find the radical right particularly appealing” (Coffe et al. 2007) \n\n\n\n***Social Capital v. Localism***\n\nSo like if you have good thoughts about your communities you will vote far right but if you’re very involved with community you won’t\nHaving very positive sentiment toward the locality and the people in it can make the radical right appealing. \nIn contrast, route engagement in community life wards off the appeals of these parties; when people invest their time and energy into participating in civil society and neighborhood life, the radical right is not so enticing an option. \n\nMoreover it is feelings of attachment not the actual routine social interaction that benefits radical right parties. \n\nWhen people avoid routine social and organizational activity, but still feel very positively tied to their local communities, they are powerfully primed to consider radical right programs alluring. \n\n\n\nFindings: \n\nI find that today’s passion for all things local and localities’ enhanced political salience have contributed to the growth of radical right parties. \nRadical right does best when locality is politically salient. \nLocal tues are most politically relevant when and where the locality has significant authority and autonomy, when and where the locality has recently lost substantial power, and when and where local elections are temporally proximal to national elections."

true?)\n\nFeatures nativism, populism, and authoritarianism\n“Marriage of convenience” with the radical right in Europe\n\nLatin America has a rich tradition of populist leaders, movements, and parties\n\n3 ‘waves of populism’ in Latin America: \n\nClassic populism of 1940s and 1960s\nNeoliberal populism during 1990s\nRadical leftist populism since 2000s\n\n\nFocus is on both leaders and parties\n\nInclusion vs. Exclusion?\n\nFramework comes from recent (2010) study of the political right in Israel \n\nThe Material Dimension – distribution of state resources, both monetary and non-monetary, to specific groups in society\n\nExclusion – groups specifically excluded from access to state resources (jobs or welfare)\nInclusion – groups specifically targeted to receive (more) state resources, sometimes to overcome long-established discrimination\n\nLatin America: Chávez and Morales have pushed policies to promote quality of life improvements for weak socioeconomic groups\n\nSocial missions (misiones sociales) \nHealth care programs, expansion of primary education, distribution of subsidized food and housing provision services\nMorales – cash transfer programs to school-aged children and improvement of old age pension\nFinanced by gas an oil and new political economy of development\nExclusion of economic establishment\n\nEurope: richer than LA, therefore instead of establishing welfare state they are focused on protecting it from outside forces (notably immigrants); focus in on exclusion of outgroups\n\nWelfare chauvinism – fairly generous welfare state generally supported for the ‘own people’ but not for ‘aliens’ (immigrants, refugees, or Roma)\nFrançais d’abord (French first)\n\n\n\nThe Political Dimension – refers to political participation and public contestation\n\nExclusion – specific groups prevented from participating (fully) in the democratic system\nInclusion – specifically targets certain groups to increase their participation and representation\n\nLA: radical democracy (or revolutionary or real); criticize elitist character of LA democracies and plead for broader political participation\n\nStrengthening the ‘voice of the voiceless’\nVenezuelan PSUV promotes formation of a protagonist and participatory democracy based on plebiscitary mechanisms and communal councils\nBolivarian Circles (’círculos bolivarianos) = groups of 8-10 people seeking to engage in consciousness raising and community projects at the grassroots level\nBolivian MAS supports new constitution aimed at political participation through direct democratic channels\nIdeology of Americanismo is an important element in defense of the model of radical democracy and in the attack on ‘foreign’ forms of political rule\nPolitical participation has increased but rules of public contestation have been undermined\n\nEurope: want democracy to be more responsive to natives and promote exclusion of non-natives\n\nPopulist parties attract higher levels of blue-collar workers\nMore young and new reps\nVehemently oppose extending political rights to ‘aliens’\n\n\n\nThe Symbolic Dimension – least tangible; alludes to setting the boundaries of ‘the people’ and, ex negativo, ‘the elite’\n\n“When populists define ‘the people,’ in their rhetoric and symbols without referring to (characteristics and values of) certain groups, the latter are symbolically excluded (for example, Roma in Eastern Europe)” (164).\nWhen groups are linked to the elite they are explicitly excluded from ‘the people’"

Issue salience = when does the backlash occurs (Adams, 1997; Dahlstrom and Esaiasson, 2013; Wojcieszak, 2018; Bishin, 2016; Belanger and Meguid, 2008; Dennison, 2020),\n\n\nResearch Design:\nA first difference correlational (not causal) analysis of the 2014 and 2018 Sweden elections. Conditional argument placing issue salience, such as liberal gender values, and resulting backlash as a right-wing extremism vote predictor. Difference in exit poles concerning the issue, gender-related Google searches (with Google trends analysis). Using the SNES for survey questions on gender issues and voting preference.\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nGender value gap increases between PRR voters and other voters when gender issues are salient = gender attitudes indicators (y) ~ voting for SD (X1) * year dummy (X2)\nConservative gender values are positively related to PRR voting when gender issues are salient = voting for SD (y) ~ on gender attitudes indicators (Xs)/Logistic regression\n\n\n\nMechanism:\nIssue salience triggers a cultural backlash: provide more information for the individual on the issue and will provoke a certain type of vote.\n\n\nFindings:\nHaving conservative attitudes towards gender issues predicted a 20% probability to vote for SD (more than doubling the prediction between 2014-2018)\n\nSD voters hold consistently less progressive views on gender issues\nThis trend increase d between 2014 and 2018 (relating to salience)/ Other voters went the other direction and increased support for progressive measures\nGap increased more for power distribution than LGBTQ questions"

Brady. 2019. “The Challenge of Big Data and Data Science.” Annual Review of Political Science.\n\nAbstract:\nBig data and data science are transforming the world in ways that spawn new concerns for social scientists, such as the impacts of the internet on citizens and the media, the repercussions of smart cities, the possibilities of cyber-warfare and cyber-terrorism, the implications of precision medicine, and the consequences of artificial intelligence and automation. Along with these changes in society, powerful new data science methods support research using administrative, internet, textual, and sensor-audio-video data. Burgeoning data and innovative methods facilitate answering previously hard-to-tackle questions about society by offering new ways to form concepts from data, to do descriptive inference, to make causal inferences, and to generate predictions. They also pose challenges as social scientists must grasp the meaning of concepts and predictions generated by convoluted algorithms, weigh the relative value of prediction versus causal inference, and cope with ethical challenges as their methods, such as algorithms for mobilizing voters or determining bail, are adopted by policy makers.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nBig data changed poli sci a lot - and there is more work to be done!\n\n\nBackground:\n\nSo much information causing overload -&gt; fragmentation of information flows.\n\ngood material explanation of maybe why people can chose their preferred media source.\n\nBig data \\(\\neq\\) better inference.\n\nthis is true if our data collection process is bad/false/problematic."

    "text": "Grimmer, Justin and Brandon Stewart. 2013. “Text as Data: The Promise and Pitfalls of Automatic Content Analysis Methods for Political Documents” Political Analysis. 21, 3 267-297.\n\nAbstract:\nPolitics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word. Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.\n\n\nOverview:\n\n\n\nProcess of Text as Data\n\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nJust because one text method works well on one data set does not mean it will work will on a different dataset.\nClassification - organizes texts into a set of categories\n\nDictionary method - use the frequency of key words to determine a document’s class\nsupervised methods: hand coding documents then giving it to the machine to train and classify.\n\neasier to validate\n\nFully automated clustering (FAC) - estimate categories then classify those documents into categories.\n\nmixed membership models - problem-specific structure to assist in the estimation of categories\nComputer assisted clustering (CAC) - looks at 1000s of potential clusterings.\n\nUnsupervised is not perfect and you need validation.\n\nText/document - unit of anaylsis - tweet, facebook post, article, sentence, paragraph\nCorpus - population of texts\nCorpora - collection of corpus.\nOrder of words does not matter. We treat our documents as a bag of words.\nstemming - reduces ends of words. This reduces dimensionality and keeps everything simpler.\n\nfamily, families, families’, familial\n\nall become famili\n\n\nTypically also discard capitalization, punctuation, very common words, and very uncommon words.\nWe can used supervised methods to validate our use of unsupervised methods.\n\n\n\nFour Principles of Automated Text Analysis:\n\nAll quantitative models of language are wrong - but some are useful\nQuantitative methods for text amplify resources and augment humans\nThere is no globally best method for automated text analysis\nValidate, Validate, Validate.\n\n\n\nSupervised Method:\n\nConstruct a training set\n\niteratively develop coding scheme\nrandomly sample to obtain a representative sample of documents\n\nuse this to train data set.\nn = 500 is ideal\n\nn = 100 is just enough\n\n\n\napply the supervised learning method-learning the relationship between features and categories in the training set, then using this to infer the labels in the test set\nvalidate the model output and classify the remaining documents\n\n\n\nFully Automated Clustering (FAC):\na supervised method we can use to validate unsupervised method\n\nSingle Membership Model:\n\nSingle membership clustering models estimate a clustering: a partition of documents into\nmutually exclusive and exhaustive groups.\n\nEach group of documents in a clustering is a cluster, which represents an estimate of a category.\n\n\n\n\nMixed Membership Model\n\n\n\nComputer Assisted Clustering"

    "text": "Michel et al. 2011, “Quantitative analysis of culture using millions of digitized books” Science, 331:6014.\n\nAbstract:\nWe constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing about 4% of all books ever printed. Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of ‘culturomics,’ focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nText as Data can help us figure out language/culture changes over time.\n\n\nResearch Question:\nHow has culture changed?\n\n\nData/methods:\n\n15 million books used for corpus\nspans hundreds of years and languages.\nrestricted to 1-gram up to 5-gram - looked at how often a 1-gram or n-gram appeared\n\n1-gram is a sequence of characters uninterrupted by space.\n\nUsage frequency is computed by dividing the number of instances of the n-gram in a given year by the total number of words in the corpus in that year.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nMore words found than in dictionary.\nEnglish lexicon has early doubled from 1950 to 2000.\ngrammar has changed"

But then I also remember, that a lot of people don’t like Obama. But, I think more people like Obama than not. I imagine that I ask everyone in the United States how I feel about Obama on a 0-100 scale. I can’t do this because I don’t know everyone and I don’t have enough money 😔. To figure this out, I take a sample, make a hypothesis, and test it!\n\\(H_o\\) : The public’s average feeling towards Obama is \\(\\leq\\) to 50\n\\(H_a\\) : The public’s average feeling towards Obama is \\(&gt;\\) than 50\nLucky for us, someone already took a sample. Wow, thank you RCPA3! Let’s call up that sample.\n\nlibrary(RCPA3) \n\nnes &lt;- nes #load nes dataset into environment \n\nWith our data loaded into R, let’s look at our sample feeling thermometer of Obama:\n\n# calculate the mean of the 'ft.obama' variable in the nes dataset. \nmean(nes$ft.obama, na.rm = TRUE) # the 'na.rm' is telling R to remove the NA values. \n\n[1] 60.87802\n\n\nWe now have a sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) of 60.87802. Of our respondents, the average feeling towards Obama was 60.87802.\nNow you might be thinking, 60.87802 &gt; 50. Thus our alternative hypothesis is right. Case closed. Whoooooa, slow down buckaroo.\nThis is a SAMPLE. Maybe this sample is not that much different from the true population feeling thermometer toward Obama of 50. We need to know how likely it is we observed this sample given the population mean (the null hypothesis) was actually 50. But again, we don’t ever know the true population parameter. We assume the null hypothesis to be true. We are trying to see how likely it is for us to observe the value we got from our sample IF WE ASSUME THE POPULATION MEAN TO EQUAL 50.\nWe can use a test statistic to figure this out. Forgot what a t-test is? Scroll up.\n\nt.test(nes$ft.obama, mu=50, alternative=\"greater\")  # do t-test of ft.obama, with hypothesis that the mean age is &gt;50\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  nes$ft.obama\nt = 26.727, df = 8164, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 50\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 60.20847      Inf\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 60.87802 \n\n\nLet’s go through what this means:\n\nt = 26.727\n\nthis is our t-test score. Basically our sample that we observed is 26.727 standard errors away from our hypothesized mean of 50.\n\nRemember this photo from earlier:\n\n\n\nWhile this relates to standard deviations and is conceptually a bit different, it still should help.\nThose numbers on the x-axis are standard errors. We can see the majority (99.7%) of all values lie within 3 standard errors of the mean.\n\nNOW IMAGINE 27.727 STANDARD ERRORS!!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱😱\n\n\n\n\n\ndf = 8164\n\ndegrees of freedom\n\nafter getting rid of the NA values we have 8165 observations\n\nremember for df: \\(n-1\\) so \\(8165-1= 8164\\)\n\n\n\np-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\np-value definition: A p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic value equal to or more extreme than the value you computed if the null were true.\n\nour p-value is in scientific notation\n\nso it’s actually: \\(0.00000000000000022\\)\nwe know that we want p-values smaller than .10 (.05 and lower is better but I digress)\nis this smaller than .10?\n\nSo what does that mean we can do?\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nwe reject the null hypothesis\n\nthe public feeling thermometer towards Obama is \\(\\neq\\) 50\nOur sample mean is statistically greater than 50.\n\nRemember!

    "text": "Prior, Markus. 2005. “News vs. Entertainment: How Increasing Media Choice Widens Gaps in Political Knowledge and Turnout,” American Journal of Political Science.\n\nBumper Sticker:\nMore channels = less political knowledge\n\n\nAbstract:\nDespite dramatic increases in available political information through cable television and the Internet, political knowledge and turnout have not changed noticeably. To explain this seeming paradox, I argue that greater media choice makes it easier for people to find their preferred content. People who like news take advantage of abundant political information to become more knowledgeable and more likely to turn out. In contrast, people who prefer entertainment abandon the news and become less likely to learn about politics and go to the polls. To test this proposition, I develop a measure of people’s media content preference and include it in a representative opinion survey of 2,358 U.S. residents. Results show that content preference indeed becomes a better predictor of political knowledge and turnout as media choice increases. Cable TV and the Internet increase gaps in knowledge and turnout between people who prefer news and people who prefer entertainment.\n\n\nResearch Questions:\n\nWhile this debate is far from settled, the issue which precedes it is equally important and often side stepped: as choice between different media content increases, who continues to access any type of political information?\n\n\n\nPuzzle:\n\nDespite increase in media supply, political knowledge among the population has remained the same.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nI propose that such accidental exposure should become less likely in a high-choice environment because greater horizontal diversity (the number of genres available at any particular point in time) increases the chance that viewers will find content that matches their preferences.\nMy second hypothesis thus predicts a widening turnout gap in the current environment, as people who prefer news vote at higher rates and those with other preferences increasingly stay home from the polls.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nThere are more media choices (supply)\n\nthis decreases the “chance encounters” with political content\n\nPolitical knowledge broadly has remained the same\n\nsome demographics have increased and decreased in political knowledge.\n\nincrease in media choice has created more voluntary segmentation among the population.\nLess supply back in the day. You watched the nightly news after dinner.\npeople exposed to news still gain political knowledge - despite lack of interest.\n\n***It is here that the author contributes\n\nthere is less accidental exposure to NEWS in a high-choice environment\n\n\nSelective exposure - you chose what you want.\nnews v. not news.\nPolitical knowledge is measured by current knowledge.\n\nwho is speaker of house?\n\n\n\n\nStudy 1:\n\nData: the News & Entertainment (N&E) Survey, a panel survey of 2,358 randomly selected U.S. residents. It was conducted by Knowledge Networks in two waves in 2002 and 2003.\nRespondents were asked from 10 categories to mark their favorite genre.\nRelative Entertainment Preference (REP)\nGreater dislike of news content coincides with a decrease in political knowledge.\nAuthor checks to see if this shapes voter turnout\n\ntheorize that more informed citizens = likely to vote and vice versa.\n\nmore news consumption = more vote\n\nfinds evidence that support this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 2:\n\nSame thing with different data\nno direct measures but closely approximated.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe analyses presented here show that both are true. New media do indeed increase political knowledge and involvement in the electoral process among some people, just as the optimists predict. Yet, the evidence supports the pessimists’ scenario as well. Other people take advantage of greater choice and tune out of politics completely. Those with a preference for entertainment, once they gain accessto new media, become less knowledgeable about politics and less likely to vote. People’s media content preferences become the key to understanding the political implications of new media"

This bad.\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe level of journalistic resources dedicated to coverage of local politics is in a long-term decline in the US news media, with readership shifting to national outlets. We investigate whether this trend is demand - or supply-driven, exploiting a recent wave of local television station acquisitions by a conglomerate owner. Using extensive data on local news programming and viewership, we find that the ownership change led to (1) substantial increases in coverage of national politics at the expense of local politics, (2) a significant rightward shift in the ideological slant of coverage, and (3) a small decrease in viewership, all relative to the changes at other news programs airing in the same media markets. These results suggest a substantial supply side role in the trends toward nationalization and polarization of politics news, with negative implications for accountability of local elected officials and mass polarization.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group is right leaning and has been buying up a bunch of stations.\nA Sinclair owned station will be viewable to 72% of american households.\n\n\n\nData:\n\nCompare local stations in the same area to Sinclair Broadcast Group stations.\nTranscript and viewership data across 743 stations - in every DMA.\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nDifference-in-Difference & Cross sectional regression\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Bonten Media Group by Sinclair, the former Bonten stations’ content shifted toward coverage of national politics at the expense of local politics, relative to other stations in the same media market.\nwe find evidence that Sinclair devotes more coverage to all national politics topics—including some that are harmful to its partisan objective and does not devote more coverage to some topics that might be ideologically beneficial but would also require more investment in local reporting resources.\n\n\n\nPolicy implications:\n\nOne factor enabling Sinclair’s rapid recent expansion is FCC’s elimination of the “main studio rule,” which required local news stations to maintain a physical studio in the broadcast area. For Sinclair and other conglomerates, the potential for economies of scale resulting from the elimination of the rule is straightforward."

Forthcoming. “Consuming Cross-Cutting Media Causes Learning and Moderates Attitudes: A Field Experiment with Fox News Viewers,” Journal of Politics.\n\nBumper Sticker:\nCross-cutting media can influence people!\n\n\nAbstract:\nMany Americans consume aligned partisan media, which scholars worry contributes to polarization. Many propose encouraging these Americans to consume cross-cutting media to moderate their attitudes. However, motivated reasoning theory posits that exposure to cross-cutting media could backfire, exacerbating polarization. Building on theories that sustained exposure to novel information can overcome motivated reasoning and that partisan sources on opposite sides cover distinct information, we argue that sustained consumption of cross-cutting media leads voters to learn uncongenial information and moderate their attitudes incovered domains. To test this argument, we used data on actual TV viewership to recruit a sample of regular Fox News viewers and incentivized a randomized treatment group to watch CNN instead for a month. Contrary to predictions from motivated reasoning, watching CNN caused substantial learning and moderated participants’ attitudes in covered domains. We close by discussing challenges partisan media may pose for democracy.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nDoes exposure to cross-cutting media reduce polarization?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nDoes exposure to cross-cutting media reduce polarization?\nDo people have a backlash effect when seeing other opinions?\ntheories of motivated reasoning argue that exposure to cross-cutting content can back fire and actually make beliefs and attitudes more extreme\n\npeople may generate ‘counter-arguments’.\n\n“A key prediction of motivated reasoning theoryis backlash: exposure to counter-attitudinal evidence will cause people to hold more strongly totheir preexisting positions.”\n\n\nWe argue that sustained consumption of cross-cutting media can lead voters to learn uncongenial information and moderate their attitudes.\n\nuncongenial means unpleasent.\n\nStations fundamentally focused on different issues.\nbalance test makes sure control and treatment samples are not different.\n\n\nMotivated Reasoning:\n\nMotivated reasoning theories argue that motivated reasoning happens in two phases (e.g., Lodge and Taber 2013, p. 152): at the stage of information search, when people seek out confirmatory information\nsecond, when people process information to which they are exposed\nThese are analogous to the Receive (selective exposure) and Accept (information processing) steps of Zaller’s (1992) RAS model (Nyhan 2014)\nAuthors argue viewers who engage in sustainted exposure to cross-cutting can overcome motivated reasoning in information processing.\n\npartisan sides cover topics differently.

    "text": "Gelman, Andrew and Gary King. 1993. “Why are American Presidential Election Campaign Polls so Variable When Votes are so Predictable?” British Journal of Political Science.\n\nAbstract\nAs most political scientists know, the outcome of the American presidential election can be predicted within a few percentage points (in the popular vote), based on information available months before the election. Thus, the general campaign for president seems irrelevant to the outcome (except in very close elections), despite all the media coverage of campaign strategy. However, it is also well known that the pre-election opinion polls can vary wildly over the campaign, and this variation is generally attributed to events in the campaign. How can campaign events affect people’s opinions on whom they plan to vote for, and yet not affect the outcome of the election? For that matter, why do voters consistently increase their rupport for a candidate during his nominating convention, even though the conventions are almost entirely predictable events whose effects can be rationally forecast? In this exploratory study, we consider several intuitively appealing, but ultimately wrong. resolutions to this puzzle and discuss our current understanding of what causes opinion polls to fluctuate while reaching a predictable outcome. Our evidence is based on graphical presentation and analysis of over 67,000 individual-level responses from forty-nine commercial polls during the 1988 campaign and many other aggregate poll results from the 1952-92 campaigns. We show that responses to pollsters during the campaign are not generally informed or even, in a sense we describe, ‘rational’. In contrast, voters decide, based on their enlightened preferences, as formed by the information they have learned during the campaign, as wel! as basic political cues such as ideology and party identification, which candidate to support eventually. We cannot prove this conclusion, but we do show that it is consistent with the aggregate forecasts and individual-level opinion poll responses. Based on the enlightened prefer- ences hypothesis, we conclude that the news media have an important effect on the outcome of presidential elections - not through misleading advertisements. sound bites, or spin doctors, but rather by conveying candidates’ positions on important issues.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nWhy do polls vary?\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nIf political scientists can forecast the election outcome reasonably well on the basis of fundamental variables measured before the campaign, why do the polls vary so much?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\nOur working hypothesis is that voters cast their ballots in general election contests for president on the basis of their ‘enlightened preferences’.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nonly focused on presidential elections\n\n\nSection 1: Forecasting Evidence and Data Summaries\n\nRosenstone’s forecasting model appears to be the gold standard for presidential races.\nUse Campbell’s forecast because they couldn’t find a Rosenstone forecast for the 1992 race.\n\nThey are going to alter it a little. However, below is Campbell’s model:\n\nVarious variables:\n\nnationwide:\n\nDemocratic candidate’s share of the trial heat polls two months before the election\nincumbency (0, 1, or - 1, depending on the party)\nand the change in Gross National Product (GNP) in the preceding year (counted positively or negatively, depending on whether the Democrats or the Republicans are the incumbent party)\n\nStatewide:\n\nthe state’s vote in the last two presidential elections (relative to the nationwide vote in each case)\na presidential and vice-presidential home-state advantage (0, 1, or - l)\nthe change in the state’s economic growth in the past year (counted positively or negatively depending on the incumbent party)\nthe partisanship of the state (measured by the proportion of Democrats in the state legislature) and the state’s ideology (as measured by the average of its congressional representatives’ ADA-ACA interest-group rating scores in 1988)\n\nRegional:\n\nmeant to capture various regional effects, mostly from past elections - are dummy variables for the South in elections in which one of the candidates was a Southerner, for the South in 1964, for the deep South in 1964, for New England in 1964, the West in 1976, and for the North Central region in 1980\n\nseems like a sort of fixed effects?\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems with Campbell model:\n\nit is based on a single regression specification that has been chosen because of its close fit to previous electoral data\n\nCampbell’s standard errors are probably too low\nit may be possible to generate better forecasts by choosing a fit by more substantive criteria\nStandard deviation of Campbell’s estimates is 1.5% - specification uncertainty\n\nthey square 1.5 to account for more realistic\n\n\nGelman & King will estimate a model that includes the following variables:\n\n1) the president’s approval rating, included as an interaction with the national presidential incumbency variable;\n2) the absolute difference between state and candidate ideologies, as used by Rosenstone\n3) an additional regional variable for 1960 indicating the percentage of the state’s population that was Catholic in that year.\n\nCampbell’s model ignores the year-by-year structure of the data, treating them as 531 independent observations, rather than eleven sets of roughly fifty related observations each\n\nThere is a data grouping that Campbell is missing among states.\n\nthis just seems like fixed effects for the past 11 elections.\n\nfit a two-error model - helps account for uncertainty…\n\nneed to ask josh a bit more about this.\n\n\nCambell calculates the expected number of electoral college delegates for each candidate by allocating all the delegates in a state to the candidate forecast to get more than half the vote, and then adds over all the states.\n\nFor each state, Gelman & King model yields an estimate of the proportion of the two-party vote that the Democrat will win.\n\nClinton’s expected electoral vote count is just the sum of the electoral vote in each state, multiplied by the probability that he wins the state.\n\nthis is a bit confusing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: MODELS OF VOTER DECISION MAKING AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS\n\nPrevious forecasting models use aggregate data and thus cannot say anything about individual level behavior.\nVoters do take their vote choice seriously.\n\nthey may not be able to explain their reasons.\n\nThere are fundamental variables in which voters base their vote decision on:\n\ninclude economic conditions\nparty identification\nproximity of the voter’s ideology and issue preferences to those of the candidates\n\nWhy are some elections harder to predict than others?\n\nsalience of election\nlots of stuff going on\nlow visibility elections\nin presidential elections, a lot of the ‘silly’ stuff is mostly ephemeral\n\nBy election day, voters are able to vote based largely on accurate measures of their fundamental variables. The argument here is that although presidential campaigns have an important effect, what is relevant is their existence; we expect the details of a completely-run campaign to have a small effect on the election outcome.\n\ncritically, the campaigns are assumed to be relatively evenly matched.\n\n\n\nJournalists model\n\nvoters do not take their role in the process very seriously, have very little information or knowledge of the campaign and the issues, and frequently do not vote on the basis of their own self-interest.\nBasically horse-race model.\nfocus more on character issues\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Flawed Expectations\n\nIf political scientists can forecast the election outcome reasonably well on the basis of fundamental variables measured before the campaign, why do the polls vary so much? To put it another way, if the journalists’ model is correct, then how can political scientists, or anyone else, forecast the outcome accurately? Alternatively, if the political science model is correct, why do polls vary at all, and why do they respond to specific campaign events such as conventions and advertising campaigns?\nAuthors raise several hypothesis that might explain the hypothesis listed above.\n4 flawed explanations:\n\nMeasurement theories\n\nThe polls are meaningless\n\nThe simplest hypothesis holds that public opinion polls have nothing to do with real observable political behaviour, and are as meaningless as candidates behind in the polls make them out to be. Evidence for this hypothesis is the high rate of non-response, and the perception that respondents do not take the survey seriously, giving insincere or poorly thought-out answers to most questions.\nBUT polls are connected in some way to observable political behavior\npolls before the election are good.\nthey are meaningful\nthis hypothesis doesn’t really help us\n\nQuestion wording effects and survey organization methods\n\nZaller esque\nbut doesn’t explain why support for candidates vary so much.\n\nNon-response bias\n\nanother hypothesis: survey respondents selectively refuse to answer\n\nshow a time series plot that refutes this.\n\nsurveys reflect engagement\nbad event for dem candidate?\n\nmaybe dems don’t answer.\n\n\n\nJournalist theories:\n\nThe forecasters were lucky because Bush ran a good campaign and Dukakis a poor one\n\nThis hypothesis is about the actual campaigning of candidates.\n\nIn this example, Bush was better and that is the reason for winning.\nnot sufficient evidence to support hypothesis outside of 1988.\n\n\nUnbalanced campaigns or predictable convergence\n\nThis hypothesis mixes journalists’ and political science theories, in that it accepts the forecast, but still follows the story of the polls to understand why Bush won.\n\ndoesn’t explain nor forecast that Bush would run a better campaign.\n\n\nUninformed voters\n\nassumes many voters vote based on non-fundamental characteristics.\nThis model explains the swings in the pre-election polls, but does not explain how pre-campaign forecasting methods predict so well, given that the political science forecasts do not even try to account for personalities and campaign events.\n\n\nPolitical Science Theories:\n\nthe political science theories take as a starting point that the ability of economists and political scientists to forecast election results accurately months ahead of time is evidence that the election came out just as predicted.\nBalanced Campaigns\n\nForecast models work because they were balanced campaigns (in 1988)\n“equal funding”\nStill doesn’t provide enough explanatory power.\nThe fact that modern presidential campaigns seem to be balanced, which is consistent with the political science model of voter decision making, does not solve the puzzle about why the polls varied so much\n\nthey say nothing about why polls vary so much.\n\n\nPartisans returning to the fold\n\nAn elaboration of this hypothesis is that strong partisans come home to their party first, then weaker partisans, and so on\nDifferent events bring in different groups of voters, but under the hypothesis being discussed here, the strong ones come home first, then subsequent events bring in others later.\nThe key evidence against this thesis is that the proportion of undecided voters does not drop over the course of the campaign\n\nreally? is that right? Seems hard to believe.\n\n\nRational Actor Theories\n\nAssumes voters are rational\n\neither have full or incomplete info\nstill reject incomplete model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4: Towards an explanation for poll variation\n\nOur working hypothesis is that voters cast their ballots in general election contests for president on the basis of their ‘enlightened preferences’.\n\nwe do not require that people be able to discuss these preferences intelligently or even to know what they are; we only require that they know enough that their decisions are based on the true values of the fundamental variables.\n\nwonder what this means in an affectively polarized world. Is enlightened preferences now just the party/ideology identity?\n\nThe function of the campaign, then, is to inform voters about the fundamental variables and their appropriate weights; notably, the candidates’ ideologies and their positions on major issues\n\npeople DO gather more info through the campaign.\nAt the start of the campaign, voters do not have the information necessary to make enlightened voting decisions. Gathering this information is costly and most citizens have no particularly good reason to gather it in time for the pollster’s visit, so long as it can be gathered when needed on election day.\nUnfortunately, those who consider themselves ‘voters’ are willing to report to pollsters their ‘likely’ voting decisions, even if they have not gathered sufficient information to make this report accurate\n\nthis is giving me shades of Zaller.\nimplies the power of media and elites in framing early candidacy.\n\n\nSO campaigns activate the salience of fundamental variables for voters. There is a lag and it takes time for this to penetrate into voters heads. This solidifies as the campaign goes on as voters get more info. - this is how im thinking about this.\n\nthis fits actually kinda well with Trump’s rise in 2016\nis there a panel study of voters polled and then how they voted day of actual election?\n\nOur hypothesis is that the early position of the polls is a result of the information that is readily available at the start of the general election campaign\nPerhaps people are not learning about the policies but they are overtime being activated against the other candidate/party.\n\naffective polarization.\n\n\nThus, without sufficient knowledge of their fundamental variables, and when asked to give an opinion anyway, most respondents act as they will in the voting booth on election day: they use information at their disposal about their fundamental variables, and report a ‘likely’ vote to the pollster. We believe that this report to the pollster is sincere, but the survey response is still based on a different information set from that which will be available by the time of the election.\n\nPUNCHLINE!\n\n\n\n\nSection 5: EVIDENCE FOR ENLIGHTENED PREFERENCES\n\nStart of campaign: preferences = unenlightened\n\nbased on a lot of previous lit, they seem to always be unenlightened (to some degree).\nconventions boost support\nGraph sucks in this section\nIndependents move most extremely in response to conventions.\nSome fundamental variables:\n\nparty\nideology\nrace\nsex\nincome\neducation\n\nsays edu should have almost no effect? what? no way.\n\nregion\n\nThey find Race and ideology matter less at the start of the campaign than at the end, whereas the effect of region among non-whites and the effect of gender are much higher early on.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nKing is dismissive of the journalist explanation\n\nI am too. BUT\n\n“Finally, journalists should realize that they can report the polls all they want, and continue to make incorrect causal inferences about them, but they are not helping to predict or even influence the election”\n\nI DISAGREE WITH THIS! I think they do have some impact on the outcome.\n\njosh thinks the same."

    "text": "Huber, Gregory and Kevin Arceneaux. 2007. “Identifying the Persuasive Effects of Presidential Advertising,” American Journal of Political Science.\n\nAbstract:\nDo presidential campaign advertisements mobilize, inform, or persuade citizens? To answer this question we exploit a natural experiment, the accidental treatment of some individuals living in nonbattleground states during the 2000 presidential election to either high levels or one-sided barrages of campaign advertisements simply because they resided in a media market adjoining a competitive state. We isolate the effects of advertising by matching records of locally broadcast presidential advertising with the opinions of National Annenberg Election Survey respondents living in these uncontested states. This approach remedies the observed correlation between advertising and both other campaign activities and previous election outcomes. In contrast to previous research, we find little evidence that citizens are mobilized by or learn from presidential advertisements, but strong evidence that they are persuaded by them. We also consider the causal mechanisms that facilitate persuasion and investigate whether some individuals are more susceptible to persuasion than others.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Advertising does a little to inform, next to nothing to mobilize, and a great deal to persuade potential voters.”\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nWhat effect do campaign advertisements have on those viewing them?\nDoes advertising engage citizens in the campaign?\ndoes it inform them (or enable them to adopt appropriate partisan positions on the issues?\nDoes it directly alter their evaluation of the candidates (persuade them)?\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nScant evidence that campaigns (and their advertisements) sway voters\ncampaign commercials increase reported turnout propensities, enhance viewers’knowledge of the candidates, and reinforce citizens’ underlying partisan predispositions\nPolitical advertisements are meant to persuade NOT to turn out to vote.\nBecause interest in politics is positively correlatedwith receiving political messages, individuals who do payattention to political advertising are also more likely tobe targeted by campaigns for GOTV efforts and directmail.\nJHJ find evidence that campaign advertisements are persuasive: In media markets where more pro-Bush (pro-Gore) commercials werebroadcast, the proportion of survey respondents indicating they would vote for Bush increased (decreased).\n\nhowever, variation is non-random.\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n2000 presidential election\nDV: NAES individual-level survey measures of expressed preferencesand beliefs.\nIV: unsystematic variation in broadcast advertisements in non-battleground states\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nNatural Experiment\n\nevent in real world that assigns people into groups in a random fashion.\n\nuses areas adjacent to battleground states BUT in the same media market\nintention to vote. NOT ACTUAL VOTE!\n\n\n\nDoes Advertising Engage?\n\nThe core empirical hypothesis is that the frequent airing of commercials will cause citizens to be more likely to express interest in the campaign and to turn out to vote.\nWe test this prediction by determining whether campaign interest and intention to vote are higher among NAES respondents from areas saturated with presidential campaign advertisements.\nIV: Advertising exposure\n\nmeasured as the ratings-adjusted number of presidential advertisements(in GRPs/1000) broadcast in the local media market inwhich each NAES respondent lives\n\nDV: vote turnout\nFinding: Advertising does not increase interest in campaign or intent to vote\nPrevious findings emphasized an increase but it may because of the high correlation between advertising and grassroots campaign.\n\n\n\nDoes Advertising Inform?\n\nboth perspectives predict that knowledge of candidate positions and the alignment between a respondent’s opinions and those of her party’s candidate will be greater inareas with more frequent advertisements.\nRespondents were coded as knowledgeable (1 = “Yes” or 0 = “No”) if they could accurately place both candidates on the issue orcould place Bush to the right of Gore on the ideology scale.The only evidence of citizen learning emerges in the case of Social Security reform, for which presidential advertising is associated with a greater ability to place Bush (in favor of personal accounts) and Gore (opposed to personal accounts) in both the panel and cross-sectional analyses.\nPer the column (1) estimate using panel data, and assuming an individual did not previously hold her party’s position on Social Security, a one standard deviation increase in advertising is associated with a predicted increase in adopting her party’s candidate’s position by about 2.5% (from a baseline of 32.5%,simulated 95% confidence intervals of .2 to 5.0%).\nIn summary, there is weak and inconsistent evidence for the claim that advertising enhances citizen learning or the adoption of partisan positions.\n\n\n\nDoes Advertising Persuade\n\nhigher levels of Gore advertising are associated with a decline in Bush’s favorability and these effects are statistically significant.\nDV: likability\nWhat is the content of these advertisements though?\n\nare they affective/negative?\n\nPer the column (4) estimates,a 1.57 GRPs/1000 increase in Bush’s advertising decreases the probability of obtaining an above-average likeability rating by 3.2% (from a baseline of 56.8%) while an in-crease of that magnitude in Gore’s advertising increasesthe probability by 4.9%\nLastly, we examine whether advertising affects reported vote intention and find strong evidence that it does. In the panel, a respondent who was initially undecided is predicted to subsequently support Gore 36.1% of the time and Bush 45.9% of the time. Per the column (5)results with the panel data, increasing Bush’s advertising above the average by 1.57 GRPs/1000 is associated with a 9.1% increase in the predicted probability of supporting Bush (95% confidence interval .5 to 18.2%) and a 7.8%decrease in the probability of supporting Gore (95% confidence interval −17.3 to −.3%).\n\n\n\nAssessing the Mechanism of Persuasion\n\nBased on the previous findings, the authors ask why do advertisements persuade vote choice?\ndon’t really know\ncandidate affect is one promising mechanism\n\n\n\nWho is most persuadable?\n\nA related and important theoretical concern is whetherthe effects of advertising are moderated by individualcharacteristics that determine whether individuals are exposed to campaign advertising and, conditional on beingexposed, whether they are receptive to those messages.Most prominent in this regard is Zaller’s (1992) Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) model, which predicts that political awareness increases exposure to potentially persuasivemessages, but that at high levels this awareness also allows individual to reject messages that are incongruentwith their (often well-formed) opinions.\nthis suggests that both the least and most aware are relatively unaffected by communication, the former because they do not receive it, the latter because they resist it, while individuals lying between these extremes are more susceptible to political communication.\nThe greatest evidence of persuasion appears among moderately aware respondents.\nSo if I am a campaign consultant, I am going after the moderately aware respondents."

    "text": "Healy, Andrew and Gabriel Lenz. 2014. “Substituting the End for the Whole: Why Voters Respond Primarily to the Election-Year Economy,” American Journal of Political Science.\n\nAbstract\nAccording to numerous studies, the election-year economy influences presidential election results far more than cumulative growth throughout the term. Here we describe a series of surveys and experiments that point to an intriguing explanation for this pattern that runs contrary to standard political science explanations, but one that accords with a large psychological literature. Voters, we find, actually intend to judge presidents on cumulative growth. However, since that characteristic is not readily available to them, voters inadvertently substitute election-year performance because it is more easily accessible. This “end-heuristic” explanation for voters’ election-year emphasis reflects a general tendency for people to simplify retrospective assessments by substituting conditions at the end for the whole. The end-heuristic explanation also suggests a remedy, a way to align voters’ actions with their intentions. Providing people with the attribute they are seeking—cumulative growth—eliminates the election-year emphasis.\n\n\nBumper Sticker\nPsych explains why voters weigh election year economies more.\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nWhat are voters’ intentions?\nwhy do recency effects emerge not just with the economy but also in domains such as legislative appropriations,crime, and terrorist attacks?\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nVoters tend to reward incumbents when the economy is good 6 months prior to election\nAchen and Bartels argue long term trend don’t move the needle much for the incumbents prospects.\nShort term views of the electorate can influence how officials govern.\n\n\nWhy do voters put weight on election year economies?\n\nfirst explanation: voter memories.\n\nvoters don’t remember that far back\n\nsecond explanation: election year economies may be informative of what the president has done.\n\nit takes years for a president to enact their policies and fix the economy.\nPerhaps the election year is the best year to evaluate presidents.\n\nthird explanation: psychological\n\nsubstitute the end for the whole.\nVoters are asked “How well did the economy perform during the president’s term?” but answer “How has the economy been recently?”\n“peak-end rule”\n\npeople evaluate stuff at the peak and at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\nlots of surveys\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nsurvey questions\n\n\n\nFindings\n\nCognitively easier to evaluate recent year.\nHeuristic!\nPeople evaluate years differently.

    "text": "Hall, Andrew. 2015. “What Happens When Extremists Win Primaries?” American Political Science Review.\n\ncandidate centered elections.\nfenno style\ncongressional races are idiosyncratic\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis article studies the interplay of U.S. primary and general elections.I examine how the nomination of an extremist changes general-election outcomes and legislative behavior in the U.S. House, 1980–2010, using a regression discontinuity design in primary elections. When an extremist— as measured by primary-election campaign receipt patterns—wins a “coin-flip” election over a more moderate candidate, the party’s general-election vote share decreases on average by approximately 9-13 percentage points, and the probability that the party wins the seat decreases by 35–54 percentage points. This electoral penalty is so large that nominating the more extreme primary candidate causes the district’s subsequent roll-call representation to reverse, on average, becoming more liberal when an extreme Republican is nominated and more conservative when an extreme Democrat is nominated. Overall, the findings show how general-election voters act as a moderating filter in response to primary nominations.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nHow much does the party’s electoral outlook suffer in a district where its primary voters nominate a more extreme candidate, relative to the counterfactual in which the same district nominates a more moderate candidate?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nFor these reasons it is important to study not just the immediate electoral consequences of nominating more or less extreme candidates, but also the effects of nominating relatively extreme or moderate candidates on downstream roll-call voting\nSee findings\n\nAuthor move to explain the mechanisms behind these findings.\n\nextremist may have a valence disadvantage\n\nthis is unlikely. Extremist candidates were more likely to be previous office holders than moderate candidates.\n\npossible demographic difference\n\ngender\n\nnot clearly tested.\n\n\nInterest groups prefer moderates\n\non average interest groups are more moderate.\n\nThe penalty to extremist grows with voter information\n\ndistricts where more newspaper information about local politics is available— are more able to identify, describe, and rate their representatives.\n\nthere is a info lag for voter. It may take another election cycle to realize the extremeness of a candidate.\n\n\n\n\nExtremist could also juice turnout and enthusiasm in the general.\n\n\n\nData\n\nEstimated ideological positions of primary candidates from 1980 - 2010. - Hall & Snyder (2013).\nestimate donors ideological positions?\nI think he is scaling the ideological position at the time of the primary.\nThe analysis uses a special subset of all primary elections—namely, contested primaries with two “viable” candidates who raise enough money to allow for reliable ideological scaling.\nDistricts are defined as “safe” if the party’s share of the presidential two-party normal vote, calculated as the average presidential vote share for the redistricting period, is above 60%.\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nRegression discontinuity.\n\n\\[\nY_{ipt}=\\beta_0+\\beta_1Extremist \\ Primary \\ Win_{ipt} + f(V_{ipt}) + \\epsilon_{ipt}\n\\]\n\n\\(Extremist \\ Primary \\  Win_{it}\\) is an indicator variable for the extremist winning party p’s primary in district \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\).\nThus \\(\\beta_1\\) is the quantity of interest, the RDD estimator for causal effects from the “as-if” random assignment of an extremist in the general election.\n\\(Y_{ipt}\\) stands in for three main outcome variables\n\nparty vote share\nparty victory\nDW-Nominate score of the winning general election candidate in the ensuing Congress\n\n\\(f(V_{ipt})\\) a flexible function of the running variable, the extremist candidate’s vote-share winning margin, i.e., the extremist candidate’s share of the top two candidates’ vote less 0.5, which determines treatment status.\nLater on he connects extremist election to roll call voting.\nBasically we are going to look at coin-flip elections. We are treating these as “as-if” random. IF the election are this close we can basically say this is random.\n\nsome issues here but we are assuming random\n\nthe drop in figure 2 is the actual treatment effect - the regression discontinuity.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nAmong”coin-flip”primary elections between a relative moderate and an extremist,the nomination of the extremist appears to cause a large decrease in the party’s general-election vote share.\nFinally, the third estimate uses only primaries that occur in districts that are safe for the party holding the primary, i.e., districts where the presidential normal vote is at or above 60% for the party. Here we find almost no penalty to nominating the extremist, perhaps because the partisan voters in the district support whomever the party nominates.\nbasically extreme candidates don’t perform well in general election DEPENDENT on their margin of victory in the primary.\n\nrobust at different cutoff points.\n\nAs we move to the left, i.e., as the winning Democratic primary candidate becomes more extreme, average roll-call voting first becomes more liberal, because the primary winner delivers more liberal roll-call voting. However,as the donor score becomes more extreme, Republicans begin to gain a more significant electoral advantage, and roll-call voting starts to become increasingly conservative.\n\nbasically there is a backlash effect\nwonder if this still holds?\nthinking about affective polarization in this context.\n\nperhaps people are more affectively polarized that regardless of the extremeness of the candidate, people now hate the other side so much they still work to keep that extreme candidate in office.\n\nnot clear.\n\n\n\nOverall, I find that the nomination of the extremist causes a reversal in roll-call voting, producing more conservative roll-call voting when Democrats nominate a more extreme candidate and more liberal roll-call voting when Republicans nominate a more extreme candidate.\n\nshort term effect\n\nthis effect does not hold in safe districts.\n\n\nNominating the extremist today continues to cause an ideological reversal in the district’s roll-call voting even eight years (four terms) later. The effect is present in both Republican primaries (where observed roll-call voting becomes more liberal) and in Democratic primaries (where observed roll-call voting becomes more conservative)."

    "text": "Thomsen, Danielle. 2023. “Competition in Congressional Elections: Money versus Votes,” American Political Science Review.\n\nAbstract\nCompetition among candidates or parties is a necessary condition for democracy. But who counts as a candidate and what counts as competition? The influence of money in American elections makes fundraising an appropriate alternative to vote totals, and it provides a new vantage point to assess the quality of electoral competition. I draw on a dataset of preelection campaign receipts to measure competition in U.S. House primaries from 1980 to 2020. When competition is measured with receipts, it looks markedly worse than vote share measures suggest. Moreover, the difference between vote share and fundraising measures is largest in open-seat primaries, or the best-case scenarios of competition. The disparity between measures is driven largely by candidates who have little chance of winning. The findings shed new light on resource disparities in elections and demonstrate that our conclusions about the quality of competition are tied to our measures.\n\n\nBumper Sticker\nMoney is important in competitiveness in primaries.\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nHow much does money influence primary elections\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nCompetition among candidates or parties is necessary condition for democracy (Dahl 1956; 1971; Key 1949; Schlesinger 1966; Schumpeter 1942)\nThis article departs from the use of vote shares and examines the quality of competition through the lens of fundraising.\nMoney is a heuristic for who is winning and losing (in a horse race frame).\nDonations have direct implications for whether candidates can hire staffers and consultants, buy advertisements, and access the goods and services that fuel their campaigns.\nA strong fundraising haul also attracts attention from the media and partisan elites.\nThey find that, across primaries from 1900 to 2016, the level of competition is highest in open-seat races and in constituencies with a partisan advantage.\nfundraising is a good predictor of who wins.\n\n\n\nData\n\npre-election receipts in more than 16,000 U.S. House primaries from 1980 to 2020\ntake money and look at affective number of candidates and observe across.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nAnd although financial long shots do outperform their receipt shares at the ballot box, they overwhelmingly lose and usually by large margins.\nThe main finding is that when competition is viewed through the lens of fundraising, it looks significantly worse than vote share measures suggest. The likelihood that primaries are competitive decreases across race types, with the largest difference emerging in open seats. The notion that several viable candidates are vigorously competing for voter support is not borne out when competition is measured with fundraising patterns."

    "text": "Krehbiel, Keith. 1991. Information and Legislative Organization, Chs. 1, 4.\n\nKrehbiel is trying to explain which perspective is the reason for these institutions to exist.\n\n\nChapter 1:\n\nArticle 1 section 5: “each House may determine the rules of its proceedings.”\nDebates about legislative organization are debates about public policy and who determines it.\nLegislative organization: refers to the allocation of resources and assignment of parliamentary rights to individual legislators or groups of legislators.\n\nrights to propose legislation\nrights to amend legislation proposed by others\nrights to employ staff to help study and draft legislation and amendments.\n\n\n\nTwo Perspectives on Legislative Organization:\n\nDistributive Perspective\n\nThe distributive perspective on legislative organization depicts a legislature as a collective choice body whose principle task is to allocate policy benefits.\npork barrel model\nGoal: maximize gains from trade reliably and predictably.\n\nI think this basically means efficient compromise\nlegislatures mess this up all the time.\n\nthe solution is institutional:\n\na set of rules and precedents that facilitates gains from trade by assigning parliamentary rights in accordance with intensity-and, in practice, the extremity-of legislators’ preferences.\n\n\n\nLegislators compromise based on a proportional gain\n\ngive up something less important to gain something more important\n\nmaximize this.\n\n\nThere is a trust issue here. What if people reneg on bills.\n\nprisoner’s dilemna problem\ncommittees help prevent this - certain people are endowed with power to ensure trust.\n\n\n\n\nThe Informational Perspective:\n\nThe distributive perspective is formulaic and overly emphasizes local incentives from reelection incentives of the member\nmaximizing gains from specialization\nThere is also specialization among legislators. Legislators have to organize themselves into what they are best do deal with.\nInformation issues in congress. By legislators sorting into committees they specialize, it helps overcome information issues and improves the chamber as a whole.\nThe challenge of legislative organization within the informational framework is thus distinctly different from capturing gains from trade for the distributive benefit of high-demand minorities\n\nRather, it is to capture gains from specialization while minimizing the degree to which enacted policies deviate from majority-preferred outcomes.\n\nThe solution in this perspective is to develop policy expertise and to share policy-relevant information with fellow legislators, including legislators with competing distributive interests.\nBasically: assign resources to make legislators specialized\nlegislators close to the median of chamber get special parliamentary rights to minimize partisan weaponization.\nexpertise of a legislator, improves collective benefit of the chamber.\nuncertainty is the key issue.\n\nspecifically with policy instruments and policy outcomes.\n\nwe give power (committee membership) to people well suited to help with these issues.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nAre the major principles of legislative organization exclusively or predominantly distributive, or are they first and foremost informational?\nHow and why did these legislative institutions arise?\nHow and why are these legislative institutions employed?\n\n\n\nPrimary empirical focus:\n\nstanding committees and their formation\nrules governing the amendment of legislation in the parent chamber\nrules an precedents governing the resolution of interchamber differences in legislation\n\n\n\nAn Institutional Focus:\n\nlegislative institutions: rules and precedents that act as binding constraints on legislators’ behavior.\n\n\n\nMajoritarianism Postulate:\n\nObjects of legislative choice in both the procedural and policy domains must be chosen by a majority of the legislature\n\nprocedures and action must be acceptable to the majority.\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty Postulate:\n\nlegislators are often uncertain about the relationship between policies and their outcomes\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4:\n\nCommittees existence gives credence to informational perspective.\nAre the major principles of legislative organization predominately distributive or informational?\nWHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF COMMITTEES?\n\nits not Jeffersonian thinking.\n\n\n\nInformational Origins of Committees\n\nSpecialization (not distributive politics) was at the heart of conceptualization of the committee system.\nCommittees were conceived as agents of the house.\nbasically strong theoretical explanations for division of labor from an informational perspective\nbut doesn’t capture the full picture\n\ncongress is very different from its origins.\nwe also need to discuss the fact that legislators have differing preferences.\n\n\n\n\nThe distributive perspective\n\nself-selection of committees from high demanders\nbut still doesnt explain why a collective entity would embrace self-selection\nlegislator gives up stuff so they can be an expert on the thing that matters the most for them.\n\n\n\nTest:\n\nuse interest groups\nhigh demanders do get what they want in some policy arenas."

What does that tell us when they do change?\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis study applies the theory of “conditional party government” to the interaction between the Republican party and the Appropriations Committee in the 104th House, seen in the context of developments since the 96th Congress. As expected by the theory, we find that the relatively homogenous preferences of the Republican contingent in the House led them to adopt new institutional arrangements to enhance the powers of their leaders, which in turn were used to advance the party’s policy goals. Given that the leadership decided to use Appropriations as one of the vehicles of major policy change, they and the Conference sought to monitor the committee’s actions, and to influence it to behave as they wanted. The leaders used their enhanced powers over incentives and with regard to the agenda to advance the party cause. Both leaders and the Conference sought to block policy shifts away from what they wanted, but facilitated changes in the desired direction. Finally, we expected to see evidence of the increasing applicability of the theory over time, culminating in the developments of the 104th Congress, and this expectation was borne out.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\n\nBackground:\n\nConditional Party Government: it contends that partisan organizational structures in the House—especially those of the majority party—will (under certain conditions) seek to use their powers to shift the policy outcomes produced by the body closer to the median position of the party than would otherwise be the case\n\nThe “condition” in conditional party government involves the degree of preference agreement within parties and of preference conflict between them. The general contention is that as intraparty homogeneity and interparty conflict increase, so too will the propensity of party members to grant stronger powers to their leaders and to collective party organizations, and to support their exercise of those powers in specific instances\nBASICALLY: Party = homogenous = stack cards against opponent\n\nAs intraparty homogeneity and interparty conflict increase, we would expect to find stronger party action designed to try to pull the policy chosen away from the floor median position and toward the median position of the party on issues that make up the party’s agenda.\n104th congress is polarizing\nNewt gets a bunch of power\ncentralization of power into Leader\nrules committee sets the term of debate\neven non-committee republicans were expressing disagreement with Gingrich"

    "text": "Schickler, Eric. 2000. “Institutional Change in the House of Representatives, 1867–1998: a Test of Partisan and Ideological Power Balance Models,” American Political Science Review\n\nAbstract:\nI examine competing explanations for House rules changes with significant partisan overtones. I sought to identify all rules changes adopted from 1867 to 1998 that were intended either to advantage or to undermine the majority party and its leaders in their efforts to shape the House agenda. I test a majority party cartel model of institutional change against a model that focuses on the ideological balance of power on the floor, that is, on the closeness of the median voter to the median member of the majority and minority parties. I also evaluate the conditional party government approach. The data analysis suggests the preeminent importance of shifts in the ideological balance. Two variables identified by the conditional party government theory, party polarization and party capacity, obtain limited support, but their effect is neither as robust nor as large in magnitude as that of change in the median voter’s position.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nCommittees used to have a lot more power and considerable deference to seniority.\nThis changed in the 90s with Newt.\n\n\n\nMajority Party Cartel Model\n\nlegislative institutions are designed controlled by majority party\nusurp power and use that power to create institutions to best serve the party members’ interest.\nThe Cox and McCubbins theory leads to the substantively important prediction that the majority party will design rules and procedures that generally allow it to pull policy outcomes away from the floor median and toward the majority party’s median position.\n\nsomething of consensus among scholars:\n\nas the majority party becomes more homogenous, rules changes that enhance its leaders’ agenda control become more likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional Party Governmental Perspective\n\nalso emphasizes the majority party’s ability to shape legislative institutions, but advocates of this theory highlight variation in the degree of partisan control\ncontend that the majority party’s influence varies as a function of the party’s internal homogeneity and the degree of polarization in the majority and minority parties’ positions.\n\n\nBasic insight:\nWhen majority party members agree on basic policy stands-that is, when they have homogeneous preferences they will have stronger incentives to give the party and its leaders increased control over the legislative agenda and decision making. By contrast, when there is disagreement on major policy issues, they will have incentives to give fewer tools to the party and its leaders.\n\n\n\nAuthor’s Argument:\n\nI argue that shifts in the ideological balance of power on the floor, rather than change in the internal characteristics of the majority party, is the key determinant of changes in House rules\nIn this model, the median legislator on the floor is the pivotal decision maker.\nI argue that changes in rules that determine the allocation depend on the ideological balance of power on the floor, that is, on the closeness of the median voter on the floor to the two parties.\nAs the floor median (measured along a single, ideological dimension) moves toward the majority party, rules changes in favor of that party are more likely; when the median moves away from the majority party, rules changes that favor the minority party are more likely\n\nthis seems kinda obvious?\n\n\n\n\nDV:\n\nI sought to identify all rules changes with significant partisan overtones adopted by the House from 1867 to 1998.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nCHANGE IN HOMOGENEITY. Rules changes that enhance the agenda control of the majority party and its leaders are more likely as the majority party becomes increasingly homogeneous. Rules changes that reduce such majority party advantages are more likely as the party becomes more heterogeneous.\nCHANGE IN PARTY CONTROL. A switch in majority party control of the House is likely to lead to rules changes in the new majority party’s favor.\nPARTY CAPACITY. The stronger the major ity party relative to the minority party, the more likely are rules changes that advantage the majority party. The weaker the majority party relative to the minority, the more likely are changes that disadvantage the majority party\nMAJORITY SIZE. As the majority party’s share of seats becomes smaller, rules changes that advantage the majority party are likely\nCHANGE IN PARTY POLARIZATION. As the majority party median moves farther from the minority party median, rules changes that advantage the majority party are like\nCHANGE IN IDEOLOGICAL POWER BALANCE. Rules changes that advantage the majority party and its leaders are more likely when the floor median moves in the direction favoring the majority party. Rules changes that reduce majority party advantages are more likely when the floor median moves in the direction favoring the minority party\n\n\n\nResults\n\nThe data analysis shows that the ideological power balance model fares quite well in explaining partisan rules changes. By contrast, the key explanatory variable derived from partisan theories, change in the homogeneity of majority party members’ policy views, does not have a statistically significant effect on rules changes."

This is where power is flexed.\nprevent votes that embarrass members of the party.\n\n\n\n\nHow do majority parties control the agenda?\n\nParties as allocating proposal rights\nParties as allocating veto rights\n\n\n\nProcedural Cartel Theory:\n\nAssumption 1: Members of Congress seek reelection to the House, internal advancement within the House, good public policy, and majority status.\nAssumption 2: The reputation (or brand name) of a member’s party affects both the member’s personal probability of reelection and, more substantially, the party’s probability of securing a majority.\nAssumption 3: A party’s reputation depends on significantly on its record of legislative accomplishment\nAssumption 4: Legislating - hence compiling favorable records of legislative accomplishments - is akin to team production and entails overcoming an array of cooperation and coordination problems.\nAssumption 5: The primary by which a (majority) party regulates its members’ actions, in order to overcome problems of team production in the legislative process, is by delegating to a central authority.\nAssumption 6: The key resource that majority parties delegate to their senior partners is the power to set the legislative agenda; the majority party forms is a procedural cartel that collectively monopolizes agenda-setting power.\n\nthis is the important one\nProcedural Cartel - is a coalition of legislators who constitute a majority in the assembly, share a common label, and cartelize the agenda via the following basic strategy.\nCartels seek to establish a collective monopoly on a particular resource (agenda setting power).\n\nFirst, the cartel creates (mostly inherits) a set of offices with special agenda setting powers\n\ncommittee chairs, slots on the Rules committee, and speakership\n\ncartel ensures all members get (or nearly all) agenda setting offices.\nCartel members expect those appointed to agenda-setting offices to always obey.\n\nthou shall not aid bills that will split the party\n\nCartel members expect rank-and-file members to support the agenda-setting decisions rendered by officeholds when those decisions are made in conformity to the expectations just noted\nCartel leadership takes action to maintain cooperation and coordination within the cartel.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther:\n\nFocus on party brand name.\ngetting rolled is basically a violation of the hastert rule.\n\nthese should be rare according to Cox and McCubbins\n\nbecause the party sets agenda\n\nnegative power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4: The Primacy of Reed’s Rule in House Organization\n“Our government is founded on the doctrine that if 100 citizens think one way and 101 think another, the 101 are right. It is the old doctrine that the majority must govern. Indeed, you have no choice. If the majority does not govern, the minority will; and if the tyranny of the majority is hard, the tyranny of the minority is simply unendurable. The rules, then, ought to be so arranged as to facilitate the action of the majority.” - Thomas Brackett Reed 1887\n\nQuick Summary\n\nAfter Reed’s Rule became a permanent part of House organization, over 80% of the bills allowed to reach the final passage stage in the typical Congress proposed to move policy towards the median voter in the majority party.\n\nhow does this compare to Schickler?\n\nthey get better data than Binder & Schickler\n\n\n\nMain Thesis:\n\nOur view is that the rules of the legislative game have been heavily stacked in the majority party’s favor since the readoption of Reed’s rules in 1894.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nReed’s rules comes out after reconstruction. Basically, the House was a mess and majority and minority parties had veto power.\nReed’s rules break the power of the minority’s power to delay\n\n\n\nReed’s Rule\nThese come about because there is a logjam of bills in the reconstruction congress. Minority power could gum up the system. Prevent delay!\n\na rule giving the speaker the power to refuse to recognize members seeking to make dilatory motions\na rule allowing the speaker to count all members physically present in the chamber during quorum calls, even if those members chose not to answer when their names were called\n\nthis is most famous one\n\na rule lowering the quorum in Committee of the Whole and permitting cloture of debate by majority vote on any part of a bill being considered.\na rule allowing the speaker to refer House bills, Senate bills, and messages from the president to appropriate committees (including conference committees) without debate.\n\n\n\nPunchline:\n\nReed’s rules give more power to the majority."

Institutions influence thought process. Shape social norms. Joe manchin believeing in the filibuster is an example. He totally believes that stuff.\n\nTheory:\nThe institutionalization of the presidency involves the process by which the office as an organization attains stability and value as an end in itself. Stability denotes that the entity cannot be easily altered or eliminated, while value involves the entity acquiring a distinctive identity. More specifically, the presidency becomes institutionalized when it attains high levels of four features: autonomy (the independence of the presidency from other units), adaptability (the longevity of units in the presidency), complexity (the dif ferentiation of subunits and staff in the office), and coherence (the manageable volume of work). Institutionalization results from an interplay between individual interests within the organization and aspects of the environment.\n\n\nHypothesis:\nGovernment activity, congressional action, and individual presidents’ efforts affect the degree of institutionalization across the dimensions of autonomy, adaptability, complexity, and coherence.\n\n\nMethods:\nFrom 1924 to 1992, several descriptive indicators of the four dimensions of in stitutionalization are analyzed, including expenditures, duration of organizational units, employees, and workload. A multivariate model is then estimated for the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, and White House Office using ordinary least squares.\n\n\nResults:\nThe presidency emerged as an institution in the 1970s. In estimating the impact of government activity, congressional action, and individual presidents on various indica tors of institutionalization, national government activity-measured by social welfare expenditures and defense expenditures-has the greatest impact. The effect of congres sional activity is more limited. The indicators for differences among individual presi dents have little effect\n\n\nBackground:\n\nPrevious presidential literature typically focuses on the personality, leadership, and decision making style of the presidency.\n\nthe key feature of the office IS the president.\n\nnot the institutional nature of the the presidency.\n\nAuthors are going to shift away from this.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Framework for Institutionalization:\n\nWe define institutionalization as the process by which an organization “acquires values and stability” as an end in itself.\n\nto “institutionalize” is to infuse with value beyond the technical requirements of the task at hand.\n\nas an organization achieves stability and value, it becomes an institution.\n\nStability denotes that the organization is no longer a mechanistic entity, easily altered or eliminated. Instead, as an organization institutionalizes, it survives various internal and environmental challenges and achieves self-maintenance-it exists in the future because it has existed in the past\n\nvalue denotes “the prizing of [organization] for its own sake.”\n\n\n\nInstitutionalization results from an interplay between individuals’ interests within the organization and the environment. Individuals, who may already work as a staff or loosely-configured association, use resources to establish the organization, bolster its persistence, and make their activities more routine. The environment creates conditions for the organization to be taken for granted as it conducts specialized activities upon which other units grow to depend (Zucker 1991, 105).\n\ngreater the institutionalization, the more it acts upon the individuals.\nAs the organization becomes institutionalized, it exhibits continuity and importance in spite of changes in individual or environmental exogenous constraints.\n\n\nWhen does an organization become institutionalized?\n\neasier to say when an organization is not an institution then the other way around.\n\n\n\n\nInstitutionalizing the Presidency\n\nFor much of its history, the president was literally just the president\n\nhad no organizational or institutional qualities\n\nSome disagreement about when the institutionalization of the presidency began\n\nsome think it started in 1939 with the creation of the Executive Office of the Presidency\n\nothers think it started before.\n\nauthors think it started before in 1924 with the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921\n\npresidents now had to draft budgets and the bureau of the budget was established to help assemble the document.\n\n\n\n\nFollow 1924 through 1992 to see how the presidency acquired external (autonomy and adaptability) and internal (complexity and coherence) institutional elements.\nHuntington defines the following as critical for institution:\n\n\nAutonomy:\n\nthe growth of an organizations budget - which shapes its stability and value.\n\nlarger the budget the more stable the organization\n\nAs the presidency becomes more institutionalized, administrations are able to offer policy directions free from other parts of the government, notably Congress.\n\n\n\nAdaptability:\n\nthe “safety valve” of the institution.\n\nthe organization is subject to shifts as presidents add and subtract units, but it continues to develop over time, adjusting to these changes, as some new units become part of the enduring composition of the organization\n\n\n\n\nComplexity:\n\ncomplexity marks an organization’s increased division of labor and specialization.\nmeasure of complexity: organization’s total units.\n\nstaff size is another one.\n\n\n\n\nCoherence:\n\nCoherence involves the ability of the organization to manage its work load.\nmeasured with clearance criteria\n\nWhile not ideal, this measure of clear ance volume captures much of what underlies coherence-the deadlines, guidelines, and preferences involved in managing the workload. More uniform volume denotes increased coherence.\n\nRegularized decision making. NOT AD HOC!\n\n\n\nGeneral Conclusion\n\nPresidency was NOT institutionalized in 1939 with the creation of the EOP.\nit was an organization that started the process of institutionalization\nPRESIDENTS STILL MATTER IN THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS!\n\n\n\n\nDeterminants of Presidential Institutionalization\n\nWe offer a model of institutionalization specifying that the political environment and the behavior of individuals within the presidency, notably decisions of presidents themselves, shape the process\nEnvironmental factors:\n\nFirst, the growing activity of the federal government enlarges the independent responsibilities of its several branches.\nSecond, the seeming intractability of major policy problems places demands on the presidency for novel policy solution\n\nhis reasons here are AWFUL. LOL\n\nhis evidence supports the theory but his theoretical argument seems bad to me.\n\n\nFinally, congressional activity is apt to affect presidential institutionalization\n\n-   \"The more active Congress is, the more autonomous the presidency is likely to become in order to ensure executive success\"\nResults:\n\nFirst, the strongest determinants of changing levels of institutionalization are measures of national government activity.\n\ni am confused here because isn’t this endogenous? How are we measuring national government activity? Isn’t government activity a function of the increase in these presidential organizations?\n\nMuch of the development of autonomy reflects an ongoing government commitment to such issues as social security, medical care, unemployment, and education, as evidenced by the burgeoning social welfare budget. As this national domestic policy commitment en larges and presidents’ policy roles in domestic affairs also expand, the presidential institution grows to match the environmental changes."

    "text": "Canes-Wrone, Brandice, William Howell, and David Lewis. 2008. “Toward a Broader Understanding of Presidential Power: A Reevaluation of the Two Presidencies Thesis,” Journal of Politics.\n\nAbstract:\nAn enduring and controversial debate centers on whether there exist ‘’two presidencies,’’ that is, whether presidents exercise fundamentally greater inﬂuence over foreign than domestic affairs. This paper makes two contributions tounderstanding this issue and, by extension, presidential power more generally. First, we distill an institutional logic that both supports the two presidencies thesis and implies that Congress has incentives to delegate foreign policypowers to the president. Accordingly, the logic suggests that empirical analysis should incorporate these incentives.Our second contribution, then, is to test for the existence of two presidencies in a domain that Congress cannotdelegate, budgetary appropriations, and a domain that explicitly incorporates delegation, agency creation. Consistent with expectations, we ﬁnd presidents exercise considerably greater inﬂuence over foreign policy.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nDo presidents exercise greater influence over foreign or domestic affairs?\nDo presidents get more control over agencies when they are focused on or foreign affairs?\n\nOur institutional logic suggests that even if one controls for other factors that may affect these executive-legislative negotiations—such as the partisan composition of Congress and the individual president—chief executives will tend to get more of what they want for the foreign policy agencies than the domestic one\n\nthis question is much more interesting than their first.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nPresidents have more influence over foreign policy.\nprevious studies have looked at roll call voting\nconstitution gives a lot of power to presidency over foreign policy\nPresidents vis-a-vis foreign policy: These provide incentives to delegate power to president on foreign policy from congress.\n\nfirst movers advantage in the international environment\nthe collection and dispersal of information about foreign policy\nthe different electoral incentives of congressional members and presidents\n\nThe two presidencies thesis, however, does not require that Congress be wholly uninformed about foreign policy—only that it be less informed than in domestic policy.\n\n\n\nMethods/Data:\n\nWe examine ﬁscal year 1969–2000 appropriations data in addition to 1946–2000 agency creation and design data.\n\nThe budget data enable the examination of a policy that, according to the Constitution, cannot easily be delegated to the executive.\n\nIn each case, the dependent variable captures a component of presidential inﬂuence, and the independent variables either assess the degree to which this inﬂuence differs for foreign affairs or controls for other factors that could affect policy-making.\nDon’t want an issue of selection effect. So we look at budget.\nordered probit\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nthe magnitude of the effect is notable: the president’s requested change in budgetary appropriations is approximately 8 percentage points closer in foreign and defense agencies than it is in domestic ones.\n\nThis means that for a foreign or defense agency with previous spending of one billion dollars, a president’s requests will be eighty million dollars closer to enacted appropriations than for acomparable domestic agency.\n\nThe results again indicate that foreign and defense agencies are created to allow signiﬁcantly more presidential inﬂuence than domestic ones\nSetting all other variables at their means, the ﬁrst model predicts that foreign affairs agencies are 27 percentage points more likely to have all four characteristics that enhance presidential control.\nIn sum, we ﬁnd substantial evidence that presidents secure more administrative inﬂuence over foreign policy agencies than domestic ones. Given that bureaucracies are relatively durable, our results point to an evolving bureaucracy where presidents have more and more control in foreign than domestic policy"

    "text": "McCubbins, Mathew and Thomas Schwartz. 1984. “Congressional Oversight Overlooked: Police Patrols versus Fire Alarms,”American Journal of Political Science.\n\nIs Congress actually abdicating their power?\nKey point - absence of oversight is not the absence of intent to oversee.\nThis is really important for principle-agent.\n\n\nAbstract:\nScholars have often remarked that Congress neglects its oversight responsibility. We argue that Congress does not do such thing: what appears to be a neglect of oversight really is the rational preference for one form of oversight - which we call fire-alarm oversight- over another form- policy-patrol oversight. Our analysis supports a somewhat neglected way of looking at the strategies by which legislators seek to achieve their goals.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nBunch of scholars basically think congress doesn’t care about its oversight responsibility.\n\nAuthors disagree and say that this neglect is actually a form of oversight.\n\nCongressional oversight policy concerns whether, to what extent, and in what way Congress attempts to detect and remedy executive-branch violations of legislative goals.\n\n\nPolice-Patrol Oversight\n\nCongress examines a sample of executive-agency activities, with the aim of detecting and remedying any violations of legislative goals and, by its surveillance, discouraging such violations.\nliterally analogous to a police-patrol.\nsurveillance includes reading documents, commissioning scientific studies, conducting field observations, and holding hearings to question officials and affected citizens.\n\n\n\nFire-Alarm Oversight\n\nAnalogous to fire alarms\ncongress establishes a system of rules, procedures, and informal practices that enable individual citizens and organized interest groups to examine administrative decisions (sometimes in prospect), to charge executive agencies with violating congressional goals, and to seek remedies from agencies, courts, and Congress itself.\ndecentralized!\ninvolves less active and direct intervention than police-patrol oversight.\nGreater role for citizens and interest groups to help Congress.\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions of Model:\n\nTechnological Assumption:\n\nTwo forms of oversight are available, Police-Patrol and Fire-Alarm\n\nCongress can chose between these two forms.\n\nWhen writing legislation Congress can include police patrol measures such as sunset reviews, or fire-alarm features such as requirements for public hearing\nWhen it evaluates an agencies performance, Congress can either call oversight hearings to patrol for violations of legislative goals or else wait for alarms to signal potential violations.\n\n\n\nMotivational Assumption:\n\ncongressman want to take credit from supporters - citizens and interest group.\ncongressman seeks to avoid as much blame as possible for the net costs borne by his potential supporters.\n\nInstitutional Assumption:\n\nexecutive agencies act as agents of Congress and especially of those subcommittees on which they depend for authorizations and appropriations.\n\n\n\n\nConsequences:\n\nConsequence 1:\n\nCongressmen tend to prefer fire-alarm oversight.\n\nmore efficient to take credit through this oversight\nthey already do police-oversight but no one really notices\n\nopportunity-cost is negative here.\n\nthis seems like a division of labor story.\n\nfire-alarm provides more time to congressman to do other stuff.\n\n\nCongressmen might miss stuff. They don’t know everything\n\ncitizens/interest groups alarm the congressmen to what is important and what they might miss.\n\n\nConsequence 2:\n\nCongress will not neglect its oversight responsibility. It will adopt an extensive and somewhat effective (even if imperfect) oversight policy.\n\nWhen his potential supporters complain of a violation of legislative goals, a congressman gains credit if he eliminates the cause of the complaint.\n\n\nConsequence 3:\n\nCongress will adopt an extensive and somewhat effective policy of fire-alarm oversight while largely neglecting police-patrol oversight.\n\n\n\n\nIs Fire-Alarm Oversight More Effective?\n\nFirst, we do not contend that the most effective oversight policy is likely to contain no police-patrol features, only that fire-alarm techniques are likely to predominate. Second, we do not contend that a predominantly fire-alarm policy is more likely than a predominantly police-patrol policy to serve the public interest, only that it is likely to secure greater compliance with legislative goals; whether such compliance serves the public interest depends on what those goals are.\nA predominantly fire-alarm oversight policy is likely to be more effective-to secure greater compliance with legislative goals-than a predominantly police-patrol policy for two main reasons:\n\nFirst, legislative goals often are stated in such a vague way that it is hard to decide whether any violation has occurred unless some citizen or group registers a complaint.\nSecond, whereas a fire-alarm policy would almost certainly pick up any violation of legislative goals that seriously harmed an organized group, a police-patrol policy would doubtless miss many such violations, since only a sample of executive-branch actions would be examined.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nThe concept of fire-alarm oversight surely requires citizens/interest groups to be aware and communicate their feelings.\n\nHow would they do that prior to television? How is this actually functioning. This makes sense to me in a modern context with the internet and instantaneous knowledge diffusion/communication."

    "text": "Clinton, Josh, David Lewis and Jennifer Selin. 2014. “Influencing the Bureaucracy: The Irony of Congressional Oversight,” American Journal of Political Science.\n\nAbstract:\nDoes the president or Congress have more influence over policymaking by the bureaucracy? Despite a wealth of theoretical guidance, progress on this important question has proven elusive due to competing theoretical predictions and severedifficulties in measuring agency influence and oversight. We use a survey of federal executives to assess political influence,congressional oversight, and the policy preferences of agencies, committees, and the president on a comparable scale. Analyzing variation in political influence across and within agencies reveals that Congress is less influential relative to the White House when more committees are involved. While increasing the number of involved committees may maximizethe electoral benefits for members, it may also undercut the ability of Congress as an institution to collectively respond to the actions of the presidency or the bureaucracy.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhom are bureaucracies more responsive to? President or Congress?\nhow does the internal organization of Congress shape congressional influence over the bureaucracy?\nWe explore whether the institutional structure of Congress and a system of bureaucratic oversight that relies on multiple committees with overlapping jurisdic-tion tends to increase or decrease the ability of Congress to control the bureaucracy when faced with a presidentfrom the opposing party.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nMembers of Congress seek to organize Congress so that they are able to provide input on issues of potential re-election importance\nScholars take different perspectives on whether an in-crease in the number of committees increases or decreasesthe influence of Congress on agency policies\nAs Congress tries to reconcile differences between chambers and among committees, the president may have an opportunity to exert influence\nThe incentive to free ride typically increases as the number of committees increases (Gailmard 2009; Laffont and Tirole 1993), and this may affect Congress’s ability to influence agency policy.\none might question whether the existence of multiple committee overseers is a cause of congressional weakness or a response to previous presidential influence.\n\n\n\nData:\n\nSurvey of federal agency administrators and program managers designed to measure congressional and presidential influence over agency policymaking during 2007 and 2008\n\nOf the 6,690 potential respondents, 2,225 executives from 128 different agencies and bureaus provided at least a partial response, and the average agency contains 14 respondents\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nWe find that when more committees are involved in monitoring and potentially directing agency policy making, Congress is less influential than the president for determining agency policy.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nOne possibility is that as the number of committees involved in overseeing an agency increases, policy disagreements among the involved committees become more likely. Alternatively, more committee involvementmay result in less influence even if committees agree because of collective action problems and increased transaction costs.\nBased on the perceptions and opinions of those individuals most responsible for implementing agency policy, the more congressional committees involved in the oversight of an agency, the weaker Congress is relative to the president. This suggests that the more Congress cares about an issue—at least as reflected in the structure of its committee system—the less influence Congress may have over the direction of agency policy making."

But presidents frequently fill vacancies in agency leadership with unconfirmed, temporary officials or leave them empty entirely. I develop a novel dataset of vacancies across 15 executive departments from 1977 to 2016 and reevaluate the conventional perspective that appointment power operates only through formal channels. I argue that presidents’ nomination strategies include leaving positions empty and making interim appointments, and this choice reflects presidents’ priorities and the character of vacant positions. The evidence indicates that interim appointees are more likely when positions have a substantial capacity to act on presidential expansion priorities and suggest that presidents can capitalize on their first-mover advantage to evade Senate confirmation. The results further suggest that separation of powers models may need to consider how deliberate inaction and sidestepping of formal powers influence political control and policy-making strategies.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nEmpty Position Hypothesis: A president is more likely to leave high-value positions empty when prioritizing policy contraction.\nInterim Appointee Hypothesis: A president will always immediately fill low-value positions with interim appointees and is more likely to immediately fill high-value positions with interims when prioritizing policy expansion.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\n“PAS” positions require senate approval\nPAS positions without confirmed appointees could be empty or filled with interim appointees, temporary officials exercising the authority of the position without Senate confirmation.\nThe Senate enters the appointment calculus only after a president, again unilaterally, chooses to submit a nominee.\nThat is, the crucial question for a president is not as much whether a potential appointee might be confirmed but how much the president’s specific policy priorities can be advanced without a formal appointment.\nan interim appointee can typically fill the position for 210 days after the vacancy began and upwards of 720 days if the respective nominations are withdrawn, rejected, or returned, and these limits are suspended if the Senate does not return the nomination.\ninterim appointments offer presidents the flexibility to select individuals who the Senate might not otherwise confirm\nI develop a new measure of the capacity of positions themselves to advance policy priorities to expand or contract the reach of an agency—which I call their Position Value. This position value, which is independent of a particular nominee or appointee, determines whether and when rational presidents strategically forgo appointments and nominations.\n\nexpansion or contractionary\n\n\n\n\nData/Method:\n\nI develop a new dataset that identifies when a president leaves a position empty by design or unilaterally fills it with an interim appointee. These originally collected data capture the status of PAS positions (e.g., empty, interim appointee, permanent appointee), the positions’ capacity to control policy outcomes, and the Senate’s and president’s policy priorities, across all fifteen Executive departments from 1977 to 2016.\ncovers a total of 11,043 position-year observations\nDoes a theoretical game (I don’t really understand it).\nEstimates a multinomial probit\n\n0 = empty\n1 = Interim Appointee\n2 = Permanent Appointee\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nOverall, the results indicate that Position Value significantly contributes to the likelihood of both an empty position and interim appointee.\nTaken together, the Interim Appointee and Empty Position Hypotheses produce the expectation that vacant positions are more likely to be filled by interim appointees than left empty when president Position Value is “High Value (expansion)”or “Low Value.”\nContradiction value was not found to be statistically significant."

First, I show that even discretionary certiorari(the Court can choose which cases to hear) only goes so far in inducingcompliance. Second, the literature often treats the Court as a unitary actor,ignoring the Rule of Four (only four votes are needed to grant certiorari).This rule is generally assumed to limit majoritarian dominance ± this is a puzzle given that the rule itself is subject to majority control. I show that itactually increases majority power by increasing lower court compliance.Finally, while sincere behavior is often taken for granted at the SupremeCourt level, I show that potential non-compliance creates heretofore unrecog-nized incentives for the justices to conceal their true preferences, so as to inducegreater compliance. They can exploit even minimal uncertainty to manipulateasymmetric information in a signaling game of strategic reputation building,further increasing compliance under the Rule of Four.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\n\nBackground:\n\nrule of four: only requires 4 justices for certs\n\nshow, however, that the Rule of Four actually increases majority power by increasing lower court compliance.\n\nWhat do we mean by “compliance”?"

We develop a model of judicial decision making that suggests that opinions are likely to reflect the views of the median justice in the majority coalition. This result derives from two features of judicial decision making that have received little attention in previous models. The first is that in deciding a case, justices must resolve a concrete dispute, and that they may have preferences over which party wins the specific case confronting them. The second is that justices who are dissatisfied with an opinion are free to write concurrences (and dissents). We demonstrate that both features undermine the bargaining power of the Court’s median and shift influence towards the coalition median. An empirical analysis of concurrence behavior provides significant support for the model.\n\n\nResearch Question:"

Public opinion is the global policy preference of the American electorate. Policy is a diverse set of acts of 1 elected and unelected officials. Two mechanisms of policy responsiveness are (1) elections change the government’s political composition, which is then reflected in new policy and (2) policymakers calculate future (mainly electoral) implications of current public views and act accordingly (rational anticipation). We develop multiple indicators of policy activity for the House, Senate, presidency, and Supreme Court, then model policy liberalism as a joint function of the two mechanisms. For each institution separately, and also in a global analysis of “government as a whole,” we find that policy responds dynamically to public opinion change. This responsiveness varies by institution, both in level and in mechanism, as would be expected from constitutional design\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nIf public opinion governs, how does it find its way into the aggregation of acts that come to be policy?\ndoes opinion move policy?\ndoes opinion influence election outcomes?\nthrough what mechanisms does opinion work on policy?\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nDynamic representation: public opinions change, gov officials sensing the change, change their behavior in response.\n\nthis is pretty endogenous since elites supply information.\nthis def is macro level - aggregate! Don’t make an ecological fallacy! they are not applying it to individuals\n\nRepresentation exists when changing preferences lead to changing policy acts. It is dynamic representation because the idea, in its essence, is structured in time.\n“The public makes judgements about current public policy-most easily that government’s actions need to be enhanced or trimmed back.”\n\nin an abstract sense, yes. BUT the public’s political knowledge and general sense of what is going on is suspect. They are driven in large part by the cues from the elites they follow.\n\nas real-world conditions change, or as “politically colored” perceptions of policy and conditions change. And as the simple model indicates, politicians and government officials sense these changes in public judgment and act accordingly. Thus, when public policy drifts away from the pub- lic’s demands for policy, the representation system acts as a control mechanism to keep policy on course.3 The question now is how.\nPostulate 1: Rationality - Rational actors make decisions in the present, but the utility they maximize lies wholly in the future.\n\npoliticians have an information issue\n\ndon’t know who they are facing OR\nwhat issues will be salient\n\n\nPostulate 2: Information - Authors recognize the little public policy knowledge of the public. They argue politicians are tuned into an abstract/national “feeling”\nPostulate 3: Consensus - What elites talk about\n\nwhere do opinions converge?\n\nthis will likely cause a big shift\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanism:\n\nelections\n\nchanging the politicans in power\n\nchange from a liberal to a conservative congressman\n\n\npoliticians’ rational anticipation of elections\n\npoliticians have an ideal point and an expediance point (points most likely to optimize future election chances)\nwhen politicians perceive public opinion change, they adapt their behavior to please their constituency, and, accordingly, enhance their chances of reelection.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nStrategic adjustment will dampen turnover\ndrive policy through rational anticipation\n\n\n\nData\n\nPublic opinion: Domestic policy mood\n\nleft v. right. more fed or less\ntemperature check\nbunch of polls on policy and just estimates a model of aggregate vibes.\n\nsummary measure\n\n\nPolicy change: congressional votes\n\ncongressional rating scales\ncongressional roll call outcomes\nkey votes\npresidential policy liberalism\nsupreme court liberalism\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\ntime series of policy and public opinion.\nWe wish to estimate coefficients that will represent the policy making effects of turnover and of rational anticipation\nIV: public opinion and election outcomes.\npublic opinion is t-1\n\npolicymaking is at t\n\nso there is a lag on public opinion\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nFind strong evidence of dynamic representation across the board."

    "text": "Lax, Jeff and Justin Phillips. 2012. “The Democratic Deficit in the States,” American Journal of Political Science.\n\nAbstract\nWe study how well states translate public opinion into policy. Using national surveys and advances in subnational opinion estimation, we estimate state-level support for 39 policies across eight issue areas, including abortion, law enforcement, health care, and education. We show that policy is highly responsive to policy-specific opinion, even controlling for other influences. But we also uncover a striking “democratic deficit”: policy is congruent with majority will only half the time. The analysis considers the influence of institutions, salience, partisan control of government, and interest groups on the magnitude and ideological direction of this democratic deficit. We find the largest influences to be legislative professionalization, term limits, and issue salience. Partisanship and interest groups affect the ideological balance of incongruence more than the aggregate degree thereof. Finally, policy is overresponsive to ideology and party—leading policy to be polarized relative to state electorates.\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nIs policy over or under responsiveness to preferences?\nHow well do states translate public opinion into policy?\nBackground:\n\n\nHow much does opinion influence policy\n\nif a state is 30% liberal and another state is 35% liberal, it is likely the state with 35% liberalness will have more liberal policy but how much more liberal?\n\nDifference between this one Stimson et al. is the measure of specific support.\nideology is hard to map to latent variables.\nAuthors recognize the debate about how much policy voters actually know.\n\nthis is a theoretical issue and a practical issue.

There are two stages:\n\nFirst, individual survey response is modeled as a function of a nuanced demographic and geographic typology, using multilevel regression.\nSecond is poststratification, the estimates for each demographic-geographic type are weighed by the percentages of each type in actual state populations using Census data, so that we can estimate the percentage of respondents within each state who take a particular position.\n\nUse MRP to estimate opinion for 39 policies set by state governments\nuse multiple surveys\n\nsourced from iPoll - Roper Center for Public Opinion research\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nOur findings are consistent with a world in which states implement either a largely liberal or largely conservative slate of policies, rather than a policy-by-policy median voter world, in which it is possible to mix and match policies as preferred by opinion majority\nThey find that while state policy is highly responsive to policy-specific opinion, it is congruent with majority will only about half the time, revealing a significant “democratic deficit.”\nResponsiveness: Policy is generally responsive to public opinion, especially when the issue is highly salient. Legislative professionalization and term limits enhance this responsiveness.\nCongruence: Policy matches majority opinion only 48% of the time, even with large majorities. This incongruence persists across various issue areas and states.\nInfluences on Democratic Performance: Legislative professionalization, term limits, and issue salience are the largest influences on reducing the democratic deficit. Partisanship and interest groups affect the ideological direction of incongruence more than the aggregate degree.\nPolarization: State policies are more polarized than public preferences, often overshooting in the liberal or conservative direction relative to the median voter’s specific policy preferences.\nInstitutional Effects: Professionalized legislatures and term limits improve congruence, while the citizen initiative and elected judiciary do not significantly enhance majoritarianism."

    "text": "Gilens, Martin and Benjamin Page. 2014. “Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens,” Perspectives on Politics.\n\nAbstract:\nEach of four theoretical traditions in the study of American politics—which can be characterized as theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy, Economic-Elite Domination, and two types of interest-group pluralism, Majoritarian Pluralism and Biased Pluralism—offers different predictions about which sets of actors have how much influence over public policy: average citizens; economic elites; and organized interest groups, mass-based or business-oriented. A great deal of empirical research speaks to the policy influence of one or another set of actors, but until recently it has not been possible to test these contrasting theoretical predictions against each other within a single statistical model. We report on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues. Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhat type of constituent is the government most responsive to?\nDo interest groups actually affect policy?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\n4 types of theories:\n\nElectoral Democracy\nEconomic-Elite Domination\nMajoritarian Pluralism - in which the interests of all citizens are more or less equally represented\nBiased Pluralism - in which corporations, business associations, and professional groups predominate.\n\n\n\nMajoritarian Electoral Democracy:\n\nattribute U.S. government policies chiefly to the collective will of average citizens, who are seen as empowered by democratic elections.\nmedian voter theorem\nThe “electoral reward and punishment” version of democratic control through elections—in which voters retrospectively judge how well the results of government policy have satisfied their basic interests and values, and politicians enact policies in anticipation of judgments that they expect will later be made by what V.O. Key, Jr., called “latent” public opinion—might be thought to offer a different prediction: that policy will tend to satisfy citizens’ underlying needs and values, rather than corresponding with their current policy preferences.\nthis is the classic Downs model.\n\n\n\nEconomic-Elite Domination\n\npolicy making is dominated by individuals who have substantial economic resources, i.e., high levels of income or wealth—including, but not limited to, ownership of business firms.\n\nnot just economic resources but also social/institutional power\n\nthe power elite\n\n\n\nMajoritarian Pluralism\n\nGoes back to Federalist paper 10 by Madison.\n\nwhich analyzed politics in terms of “factions”—a somewhat fuzzy concept that apparently encompassed political parties and even popular majorities, as well as what we would today consider organized interest groups, business firms, and industrial sectors.\n\nDahl also part of this camp\n\nDahl’s analyses of American politics in terms of “polyarchy” or “pluralist democracy” also come close to our ideal type of majoritarian pluralist theory, since they imply that the wants or needs of the average citizen tend to be reasonably well served by the outcomes of interest-group struggle.\n\nMancur Olson complicates this perspective\n\nfree-rider problem in group/interest formation\nthe free-rider problem thus causes an issue in what and who can form groups/special interest.\n\n\n\n\nBiased Pluralism\n\nTheories of biased pluralism generally argue that both the thrust of interest-group conflict and the public policies that result tend to tilt toward the wishes of corporations and business and professional associations.\nbusiness groups prevail when scope is narrow and visibility low\nMore recently, Fred McChesney has made the ingenious argument that campaign contributions from interest groups maynotrepresent quid proquo briberyattemptsbygroups, butinsteadresult fromextortion by politicians who threaten to harm the groups’ interests.\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\n1,779 instances between 1981 and 2002 in which a national survey of the general public asked a favor/ oppose question about a proposed policy change.\nThey included policies are not restricted to the narrow Washington “policy agenda.” At the same time—since they were seen as worth asking poll questions about—they tend to concern matters of relatively high salience, about which it is plausible that average citizens may have real opinions and may exert some political influence.\nUse measures of income\n\ndivide it into percentiles.\nwill use these income divisions to test the different theories outlined above.\n\nMeasuring interest group\n\nBaumgartner et al. found that a simple proxy for their index—the number of reputedly “powerful” interest groups (from among groups appearing over the years in Fortune magazine’s “Power 25” lists) that favored a given policy change, minus the number that opposed it— correlated quite substantially in their cases with the full interest-group index (r=50.73)\n\nGilens use this but slightly modified. Same idea though.\n\ncoded whether the group was favorable or unfavorable to policy\n\n\n\nDV: a measure of whether or not the policy change proposed in each survey question was actually adopted within four years after the question was asked.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nThe central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence. Our results provide substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.\nAgain, the implication of these limitations in our data is that interest groups and economic elites actually wield more policy influence than our estimates indicate.\nWhen the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.\nFurthermore, the preferences of economic elites (as measured by our proxy, the preferences of “affluent” citizens) have far more independent impact upon policy changethanthepreferences ofaveragecitizens do. To be sure, this does not mean that ordinary citizens always lose out; they fairly often get the policies they favor, but only because those policies happen also to be preferred by the economically-elite citizens who wield the actual influence.\nWhen a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites or with organized interests, they generally lose."

    "text": "Broockman, David and Christopher Skovron. 2018. “Bias in Perceptions of Public Opinion among Political Elites,” American Political Science Review.\n\nAbstract\nThe conservative asymmetry of elite polarization represents a significant puzzle. We argue that politicians can maintain systematic misperceptions of constituency opinion that may contribute to breakdowns in dyadic representation. We demonstrate this argument with original surveys of 3,765 politicians’ perceptions of constituency opinion on nine issues. In 2012 and 2014, state legislative politicians from both parties dramatically overestimated their constituents’ support for conservative policies on these issues, a pattern consistent across methods, districts, and states. Republicans drive much of this overestimation. Exploiting responses from politicians in the same district, we confirm these partisan differences within individual districts. Further evidence suggests that this overestimation may arise due to biases in who contacts politicians, as in recent years Republican citizens have been especially likely to contact legislators, especially fellow Republicans. Our findings suggest that a novel force can operate in elections and in legislatures: Politicians can systematically misperceive what their constituents want.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nPoliticians have bias in how they perceive their constituency.\n\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nIn contexts like these,can politicians indeed systematically misperceive constituency opinion on salient issues?\nWhy did elites polarize first?* kinda a question they are circling around.\nWhy are US politicians’ perceptions of constituency opinion systematically skewed to the right?\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nHow do politicians perceive their constituents\nCircling back on Fenno 1977\nwe argue that biases in politicians’ information environments common across politicians can lead politicians as a whole to systematically misperceive constituency opinion and, in turn,to contribute to systemic breakdowns in dyadic representation like asymmetric polarization.\nauthors start with the rise of conservative public sphere outlets.\nRepublicans simply got way more political in the 2000s.\n“Politicians’ positions and the policies they make are clearly responsive to public opinion”\n\nthis is somewhat suspect based on Gilens findings.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis\n\nwe argue that politicians can misperceive constituency opinion dramatically and systematically enough to contribute to significant, one-sided biases in representation such as asymmetric polarization.\nif certain kinds of individuals are more likely to express their views in the public spheres politicians monitor, then these individuals’ viewpoints may loom disproportionately large in many politicians’ minds as they think about what their geographic constituency wants.\n\n\n\nData\n\nThis original survey evidence spans two years and 3,765 surveys of American politicians,across which we collected 11,803 elite perceptions of constituency opinion intotal. Our main evidence comes from a survey we conducted in 2014 of 1,858 state legislative politicians.\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nTo compare elites’ perceptions to reasonably precise estimates of true public opinion, we asked them to estimate constituency opinion on items that were being contemporaneously asked in the2014 CCES, a large sample survey\nUse MRP to impute survey results from CES for state districts. Because we are asking politicans to estimate how much they think their constituents support X policy. We are going to have issues where we won’t have enough observations from the respective districts. Thus we use MRP to help us.\nIn addition to the MRP, they also use a lot of math to create average district opinion and average politician opinion and then compare across. This is almost like a pooled version in a way. It is more generalizable. We are losing out on some of that geographic distinction.\nMRP is going to give greater leverage because it estimates support for each issue in all of the nation’s state legislative districts using multilevel regression and poststratification\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nOur evidence reveals that, on average, American politicians from both parties in 2012 and 2014 believed that support for conservative positions on these issues in their constituencies was much higher than it actually was.\nRepublicans overestimate how conservative their district is more than democrats. However, democrats also overestimate.\n\n\n\nWhy (mechanism)\n\nAuthors argue that it is because Republicans are more likely to contact their official (use previous study to back this up)\n\ni don’t disagree but I don’t think this is the biggest driver.\n\nAuthors don’t mention it but I really think this is a media story. Either news/social media.\n\nOne possibility our data suggest is that these misperceptions originate from patterns of mass participation in the public sphere; consistent with this, Online Appendix H shows suggestive evidence that politicians overestimated conservatism the most in districts where Republicans were especially likely to contact legislators."

This is pure nonsense. Politics has been, is, and always will be carried on by politicians, just as art is carried on by artists, engineering by engineers, business by businessmen. All that the direct primary, or any other political reform, can do is affect the character of the politicians by altering the conditions that govern political activity, thus determining its extent and quality. The direct primary may take advantage and opportunity from one set of politicians and confer them upon another set, but politicians there will always be so long as there is politics.

They are, in other words, a broad coalition aiming to control not only the presidency, but also Congress, the Supreme Court, governorship, state legislatures, city councils and county boards, and every other locus of political power in the United states.\nTHEY STILL THINK PARTIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT!\nQuestion for Josh: The median voter theory assumes voters know what they want. right?\n\nUnari and Zapal AJPS\npoliticians can pick a platform\n\nthere is platform differentiation.\n\nvalence literature.\n\nParties behave in the same basic way - as vehicles by which the most energized segments of the population attempt to pull government policy toward their own preferences.\n\nwhether parties succeed in this is irrelevant\n\nParty is most influential in the invisible primary stage.\nThe invisible primary control by the party seemed to be strongly a result of technological limitations.

    "text": "Bawn, Kathleen, et al. 2012. “A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics,,” Perspectives on Politics.\n\nLecture notes:\n\nparty coalitions and their teaming up form the ideological space.\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a theory of political parties in which interest groups and activists are the key actors, and coalitions of groups develop common agendas and screen candidates for party nominations based on loyalty to their agendas. This theoretical stance contrasts with currently dominant theories, which view parties as controlled by election-minded politicians. The difference is normatively important because parties dominated by interest groups and activists are less responsive to voter preferences, even to the point of taking advantage of lapses in voter attention to politics. Our view is consistent with evidence from the formation of national parties in the 1790s, party position change on civil rights and abortion, patterns of polarization in Congress, policy design and nominations for state legislatures, Congress, and the presidency.\n\n\nResearch Question:\nWhat evidence do we have to support our argument that parties are controlled by coalition of intense policy demanders?\n\n\nMain Argument:\n\nOur view, in contrast, places policy demanders at the center. These interest groups and activists form coalitions to nominate and elect politicians committed to their common program. In our view, party nominees are not so much “constrained” by policy demanders to deviate from what voters want, as genuinely committed to what the policy demanders want regardless of the wishes of the median voter. This view of parties and politicians is as antithetical to Burke’s idea of parties as it is to Schumpeter’s. What makes plausible the survival of our kind of party, despite fierce electoral competition, is the limited attention voters pay to politics, and especially to policy positions and outcomes.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nContemporary scholarship views a party as a team of politicians whose paramount goal is to win electoral office.\n\nthese teams make promises about what they will do if elected.\n\nthis is not ideal.\n\n\nWe argue that parties in the US are best understood as coalitions of interest groups and activists seeking to capture and use government for their particular goals, which range from material self-interest to high-minded idealism.\n\nIn this group-centric view of parties, candidates will, if the coalition has selected them well, have as their paramount goal the advancement of the party program.\n\nAuthors are aware that voters cant really judge what they want\nIn our account, parties are no great friends of popular sovereignty. Electoral competition does constrain group centric parties to be somewhat responsive to citizen preferences, but they cede as little policy to voters as possible. Parties mainly push their own agendas and aim to get voters to go along.\n\nRECALL GILENS!\n\n\n\nLegislative-Centered Theories of Party\n\nThe discipline’s most developed theories of party feature office holders, especially legislators, as the dominant actors.\nhow do coalitions form\n\nwe have three actors\n\n2 of them coordinate and achieve something better than if they didnt.\n\nBy forming a majority coalition that stays together across votes, A and B increase their pay-offs to 2.\n\nParties form because coalitions seek to win. IF there are three individual actors with different policy preferences and 1 wins. The payoffs look like:\n\nActor 1: 3\nActor 2: -1\nActor 3: -1\n\nthus actor 2 and 3 form a coalition to increase their payoffs by 2.\n\nThe gains from keeping a stable majority together form Schwartz’s and Aldrich’s answer to the question “Why Parties?”\n\n\n\nWhy do parties stay together?\n\nAccording to Gary Cox and Mathew McCubbins, party leaders control the legislative agenda, suppressing proposals that might split the party and promoting the party program. The policies thus enacted create a “brand name,” valuable for winning elections.\n\nThese are good but perspectives but limited. It only conceives of parties as legislators attempting to win reelection.\n\n\n\nAlternate Theory:\n\nOrganized policy demanders strive to recruit and elect candidates sympathetic to their goals, goals typically not shared by most ordinary voters.\nBargaining among policy demanders constructs not only the party system, but also the ideological space.\nInevitably, the party programs are less than perfect matches for the concerns of most voters, who respond with varying degrees of trust, adaptation, and confusion.\nThe importance of nominations and the nature of voter responses to parties are particularly important points; we next elaborate on each.\npoliticians are not the center of the party. Policy demanders are.\n\n\n\nWhy Nominations?\n\nGroups of organized policy demanders are the basic units of our theory of parties.\nThe long coalition strives to nominate a candidate whom each group trusts to represent its interests in a manner acceptable to the coalition as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about voters?\n\nDowns median voter theorem\n\nassumes voters can locate policy preferences\n\ndoesn’t really hold.\ncite achen and bartels shark attack paper\n\n\nWe call the policy region over which aggregate electorates do not enforce their preferences the “electoral blind spot.”\nThere is no need for either party, however, to scale back beyond the point where voters notice any difference. As long as parties stay within the electoral blind spot, they are effectively free to nominate any candidate they want.\n\n\nCompeting views of parties\n\nEdmund Burke’s def of a party:\n\nWe call the policy region over which aggregate electorates do not enforce their preferences the “electoral blind spot.”\n\nschumpeter (and many others disagree)\n\n\nSchumpeter:\n\nWe call the policy region over which aggregate electorates do not enforce their preferences the “electoral blind spot.”\n\nSchumpeter’s view emphasizes the extent to which electoral competition drives the actions of politicians and therefore parties.\nAs evidence against Burke’s position, Schumpeter goes on to note that different parties may adopt identical platforms.\n\n\nAnthony Downs subsequently connected these points, arguing that platform convergence was a logical consequence of the pressures of electoral competition on officeseeking parties.\n\n\n\n\nEvidence:\n\nGoing to look across history\nSpecifically at the Democrats around civil rights\nand at the Republicans around Abortion\nThey will argue that these changes on policy and their subsequent salience was driven not by party leaders but by intense policy demanders.\nDemocratic legislators most vocal about civil rights came from districts with a high concentration of union membership. Even more so than districts with a large amount of African-Americans.\n\nUnion membership was strongly vocal about civil rights.\n\nAuthors do not claim politicians are bystanders and not important.\nMore informed voters show preferences for moderates but there isn’t a lot of moderates. Media markets are to blame\nCitizens cannot track all policy.\nvoters struggle with figuring out what is going on.\nFail to tow the party line and the party may work against you in the primaries when you are up for reelection.\n\n\n\nMain Point:\n\nWe have challenged this syllogism at two points: First, voters do not pay so much attention to politics that politicians must faithfully execute their wishes to win election; within fairly broad limits, obfuscation and phony credit claiming work quite well. Second,interest groups and activists are the dominant players in political parties, insisting on the nomination of candidates who will exploit the limitations of voter monitoring to advance party programs."

The median issue involved only 15 interest groups, whereas 8 of the issues involved more than 300 interest groups. The top 5% of the issues accounted for more than 45% of the lobbying, whereas the bottom 50% of the issues accounted for less than 3% of the total. This distribution makes generalizations about interest group conflict difficult and helps explain why many scholars have disagreed about the abilities of lobbyists to get what they want.

Nonetheless, their behavioral patterns often appear anomalous when viewed in the light of existing theories. We revisit these anomalies in search of an alternative theory. We model lobbying not as exchange (vote buying) or persuasion (informative signaling) but as a form of legislative subsidy—a matching grant of policy information, political intelligence, and legislative labor to the enterprises of strategically selected legislators. The proximate political objective of this strategy is not to change legislators’ minds but to assist natural allies in achieving their own, coincident objectives. The theory is simple in form, realistic in its principal assumptions, and counterintuitive in its main implications. Empirically, the model renders otherwise anomalous regularities comprehensible and predictable. In a later section, we briefly bring preferences back in, examining the important but relatively uncommon conditions under which preference-centered lobbying should occur.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\n\nBackground:\n\nPrevious lobby theories:\n\none that conceptualizes lobbying as a form of exchange,\nthe other as persuasion—both mechanisms for changing legislators’ preferences over policies.\n\nWe propose a fundamentally different but fundamentally simple theory of lobbying. The main idea is that lobbying is primarily a form of legislative subsidy—a matching grant of costly policy information, political intelligence, and labor to the enterprises of strategically selected legislators.\n\nThe proximate objective of this strategy is not to change legislators’ minds but to assist natural allies in achieving their own, coincident objectives.\nbasically provide help when policies align.\n\nExchange theory\n\nbuying votes basically\nquid pro quo\n\nthis is kinda unlikely\nwhat is stopping from the politician reneging?\n\nAlso, PAC managers give the most to politicans that align with them.\n\nif this were true, wouldn’t it be the other way around?\n\n\nLobbying as persuasion\n\nIn the newer view, information transmission is at the heart of the lobbyist–legislator relationship, but contrary to the older pluralists, that information is not innocuous.\n\nDirect lobbying, in our view, typically is not a strategy for changing legislators’ preferences over policies. Nor is it about keeping them from being changed. Rather, it is an attempt to subsidize the legislative resources of members who already support the cause of the group.\n\n\n\nAssumptions:\n\nFor a legislator to have much influence on policy, she must work at it\nLegislators’ resources are scarce\nFor any given period, individual legislators care about influencing more than one policy at a time\nLegislators care about some issues more than others\nRelative to legislators, lobbyists are specialists\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nLobbyists will lobby their allies, where “allies” refer to legislators who share the same policy objective as the group.\nLobbyists will lobby most their strongest allies, where strength refers to the legislator’s marginal willingness to pay for progress toward the policy objective the member and group share.\nLobbyists will not lobby their enemies.\nLobbyists will seldom lobby uncommitteds, where uncommitted here refers to legislators for whom it is uncertain whether they favor progress or regress on A.\nAs lobbying increases, so will the participation or “effort” of allies.\nLobbying will increase most the participation of the lobbyist’s strongest legislative allies.\nLobbying uncommitted legislators or enemies (to the extent that this happens) will not increase those legislators’ participation.\nLegislators will give access to (be lobbied by) like-minded public interest groups, even if the latter have no reelection-relevant assets.\nLobbying by public interest groups without reelection-relevant assets will increase the participation or “effort” of allies.\nLobbyists will lobby legislative allies with the most productive enterprises.\nLobbying will increase the participation of the lobbyist’s most productive allies."

    "text": "McCrain, Joshua. 2018. “Revolving Door Lobbyists and the Value of Congressional Staff Connections,” Journal of Politics\n\nAbstract:\nBuilding on previous work on lobbying and relationships in Congress, I propose a theory of staff-to-staff connections as a human capital asset for Capitol Hill staff and revolving door lobbyists. Employing lobbying disclosure data matched to congressional staff employment histories, I find that the connections these lobbyists maintain to their former Hill coworkers primarily drive their higher relative value as lobbyists. Specifically, a 1 standard deviation increase in staff connections predicts an 18% increase in revenue attributed to the lobbyist during her first year. I also find that the indirect connections lobbyists maintain to legislators through knowing a staffer in a legislative office are of potential greater value than a direct connection to a senator given a large enough number of connections. This article sheds additional light onto the political economy of the lobbying industry, making an important contribution to the literature on lobbying and the revolving door phenomenon.\n\n\nResearch Question:\nThis article establishes a story of revolving door lobbying that suggests staffers who become lobbyists benefit from connections to their staff colleagues, a unique human capital asset they can bring to the private sector.\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\nData:\n\nstaff employment book\nlegistorm"

The problem with this popularly held view is that it is entirely anecdotal. In assembling several new data sets to test this proposition systematically, we ﬁnd that women are more likely than men to participate in the kinds of activities that foster collegiality. But we uncover almost no evidence that women’s legislative behavior on fact ﬁnding abroad, cosponsoring legislation, or engaging the legislative process differs from men’s. The partisan divide that now characterizes the legislative process creates strong disincentives for women (and men) to engage in bipartisan problem solving. To be sure, women’s presence in Congress promotes democratic legitimacy, but it does little to reduce gridlock and stalemate on Capitol Hill.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nDo women legislate or act differently in legislative discussions compared to male legislators?\nAre women more collegial than men?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nAs a result of these friendships—so these popular accounts go—women are more likely to trust and cooperate with one another when it comes to governing.\nFirst, women are more likely than men to develop personal relationships with their colleagues and, thus, a sense of trust.\n\ngood evidence for this.\n\nSecond, women, having established this trust, are more likely than men to cooperate with colleagues to move the legislative process along.\n\nwomen, because of the personal relationships they have built, will be more bipartisan than men in moving the legislative process along\nless evidence for this.\n\nsocial capital among political elites.\nA substantial body of research also ﬁnds that women are more likely than men to prioritize these personal relation-ships and, as such, to engage in collegial behavior professionally.

This racial divide is most pronounced on policies that intrude conspicuously on the fortunes of blacks and whites, but it is also apparent on a wide array of social welfare issues where race is less obviously in play. Our analysis takes up the question of why blacks and whites differ so markedly, distinguishing among four alternative interpretations: one centers attention on underlying differences of class, another on political principles, a third on social identity, and the fourth on audience. Our results are complicated but coherent. We discuss their implications for the meaning of group interest, speculate on the conditions under which the racial divide might close (or widen) in the foreseeable future, and suggest why we should not wish racial differences in opinion to disappear.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhy do Black and White Americans disagree?\nWhat is the policy divide along a racial dimension?\nHow are the four potential reasons influencing the racial dimension?\n\nwhich one accounts for the most?\n\nTo what extent is this racial divide attributable to class differences?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\n\nBasic punchline\n\n\n\n4 potential reasons:\n\nMaterial interest and Social Class\n\ncitizens are single minded and care only about preserving or improving their material interest.\n\neconomic approach\nis division of race just division of class?\n\n\nSocial Identity: Sympathy and Resentment toward Social Groups\n\nmeasure in group and out group apathy\nthermometer scale\nwhite rate black and vice versa\n\nMatters of Principle\n\nEquality\nLimited Government\n\ndifferences between Black and White respondents on these two are also noticeable.\n\n\nAudience\n\nblack Americans tend to express more liberal positions on race policy when interviewed by blacks than when questioned by whites, while white Americans interviewed by whites generally appear more conservative on matters of race policy than when they are interviewed by blacks\nrace of interviewer matters\n\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\n1992 ANES\n\n1883 White\n289 Black\n\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nBunch of regressions\ninclude interaction terms between each IV and race.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nClass differences are trivial\ntwo main divides: racial inequality and the welfare state.\nlimited government very important among white respondents\nBlacks prize equal opportunity, whites worry about big government, blacks express solidarity with their racial group, racial resentments are common among whites: these are the primary elements of the racial divide on matters of race.

    "text": "Enos, Ryan. 2016. “What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior,” American Journal of Political Science\n\nAbstract:\nHow does the context in which a person lives affect his or her political behavior? I exploit an event in which demographic context was exogenously changed, leading to a significant change in voters’ behavior and demonstrating that voters react strongly to changes in an outgroup population. Between 2000 and 2004, the reconstruction of public housing in Chicago caused the displacement of over 25,000 African Americans, many of whom had previously lived in close proximity to white voters. After the removal of their African American neighbors, the white voters’ turnout dropped by over 10 percentage points. Consistent with psychological theories of racial threat, their change in behavior was a function of the size and proximity of the outgroup population. Proximity was also related to increased voting for conservative candidates. These findings strongly suggest that racial threat occurs because of attitude change rather than selection.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nHow does geography influence political behavior\nWhen African Americans are removed from the neighborhood, how do white voters respond?\ndid white voters close to the projects vote more or less after the projects were demolished?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nIs racial threat real?\n\nthe presence of an out group\npeople are more politically attentive when they feel threatened.\n\nConflicting results in past studies\nBig problem = people selecting where they want to live.\nWhite attitudes of Black people are relatively stable overtime\n\nmostly socialized when younger.\n\nSo should we expect a big difference of context?\n\n\nWhat constitutes “racial threat”\n\nnot everyone perceives the same way.\n\nA related difficulty is the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), that is, the possibility that the sometimes arbitrary boundaries of some areal units, such as census tracts, can greatly affect estimates of underlying population parameters.\nWhen using aggregate data to measure an underlying population parameter, the choice of the areal unit can matter as much as the underlying variation in population characteristics.\nChicago public housing\n\nmostly african american lived\nsome were to be destroyed - chosen exogenously.\n\nTwelve CHA projects were completely or partially demolished between 2000 and 2004, displacing over 25,000 people.\n\n\n\nData:\n\nvote choice\nvote turnout\nI obtained the 2004 Illinois voter file and augmented it with demographic data from the 2000 and 2010 Census counts.\nI geocoded the residences of the approximately 1.2 million voters in Chicago and determined their distance from each of the demolished public housing projects using a Geographic Information System\nI was able to identify the exact distance of each voter to the edge of a housing project using data on the two dimensional spatial boundaries of the housing projects.\nI collected a unique data set of property records, including homeownership data and homevalues, for all Chicago voters. I also identified each voter’s race using a Bayesian process based on the voter’s name and location.\nElection returns and precinct GIS data were also obtained from the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners.\nunit of analysis is individual level.\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\nThe treatment is the demolition, and the outcome is the change in white political participation and support for conservative candidates.\nI measure the effects by measuring changes in presidential election turnout between 2000 and 2004.\nTreatment group is voters that lived close to the demolished buildings\nControl is those who lived far away\ndiff-in-diff\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nH1 (Racial Threat and Turnout): After the demolition of the projects, turnout should decline for white voters close to the projects relative to the rest of the city.\nH2(Proximity and Size):The salience of a group is a strong predictor of intergroup attitudes (Brewer and Miller 1984). Psychologists have empirically demonstrated the intuitive finding that salience can be a function of the size and “immediacy” of an object (Latan´e 1981; Latan´e and L’Herrou 1996; Latan´e et al. 1995; Lewenstein, Nowak, and Latan´e 1992; Latan´e and Wolf 1981). This leads me to expect a “dose effect,” whereby the treatment should vary with the size and proximity of the treatment. Operationally, the treatment effect should decline as the white voters are farther away from a project and as the population of a project represents a smaller portion of the local outgroup population.\nH3 (Racial Threat and Vote Choice): After the demolition of the projects, white voters close to the former projects should experience a decline in racially conservative voting relative to the rest of the city.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nAfter the demolition, voter turnout dropped by more than 10 percentage points for white voters living nearest to the projects.\nI also demonstrate that whites living near the projects had voted more conservatively than whites living farther away and that this difference disappeared after the removal of their African American neighbors.\nNull effects for Black individuals\n\nmeans this is only going on for white individuals"

Discussions about diversity usually focus on how individuals’ identities shape their behavior, but diversity is a group-level characteristic. Scholars must, therefore, consider the relationship between group composition and the individual decisions that shape institutional outcomes. Using felony data from a large U.S. court system, I explore the relationship between racial diversity among the judges comprising a court and individual judges’ decisions. I find that as the percent of Black judges in a courthouse increases white judges are less likely to render incarceration sentences in cases with Black defendants. Increases in racial diversity decrease the Black–white gap in the probability of incarceration by up to 7 percentage points. However, I find no relationship between judge’s racial identities and disparities in their decisions. This study highlights the importance of conceptualizing diversity as a group characteristic and the relationship between institutional context and outcomes.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nHow does racial diversity impact institutional outcomes and (in)equality?\nhow the composition of a judge’s group of colleagues can influence their sentencing decisions in criminal cases\nhow this influence may differ based on a judge’s own personal characteristics\nwhat this means for disparities in sentencing and how we think about diversity in state and local institutions.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nCoworker effect\nWhile research on the effects of racial diversity in the judiciary has largely focused on the impact of individual judges’ identities on decision making, much less work has investigated the impact of racial diversity as a contextual feature of the bench.\nI argue that increasing the representation of racial-minority-group members on the bench decreases racial disparities in felony sentencing, not because of these judges’ behavior, but because their presence alters their peers’ behavior.\nAn individual cannot be “diverse.” Individuals contribute to a group’s diversity\nAs members of minority racial groups gain representation in homogenous institutions dominated by majority-racial-group members, the altered context can influence the decision making of individuals from all racial groups.\nNon-white government officials working in white-dominated institutions may also face pressures to make decisions that are generally more favorable to majority-group members (Allport Allport1955; Steffensmeier and Steffensmeier and Britt2001).\nHowever, intergroup contact can lead to negative outcomes\nRepeated, long-term, and positive inter-group contact may lead to more positive outcomes, including decreasing out-group prejudice\nOverall, we might expect these positive experiences with peer racial-out-group members to improve majority-racial-group member officials’ perceptions and treatment of minority-racial-group members.\n\n\nMechanism:\n\nFirst, the introduction of individuals that increase a group’s diversity may change the type of information exchange that occurs, thereby influencing the knowledge and considerations individuals rely on when making decisions\n\nThe general process here is that as racial diversity in a group increases, the content of group conversations will include information related to race and racism that leads individuals in the group to more positively evaluate minority-racial-group members, such that future decisions will be more favorable to members of that racial minority group\n\nSecond, seeing and interacting with a more racially diverse set of colleagues may make majority-racial-group institution members desire not to appear discriminatory against out-group members or biased in favor of in-group members in their behavior.\nthird, it could remind majority-group-member officials of their own desire to avoid prejudiced behavior\nfourth, a racially diverse group of colleagues may change the extent to which race is a salient consideration in their decision making.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nIn general, I expect increases in racial diversity among judges to lead to decreases in punitiveness and decreases in race-based sentencing disparities.\nI expect increases in Black judicial representation will lead to decreases in the probability of incarceration and sentence length.\nAs the court becomes more racially diverse, I expect white judges to become more lenient toward Black defendants due to the processes described above.\nBlack judges may similarly become less likely to incarcerate Black defendants as they gain Black colleagues. However, it is unclear, how many Black colleagues would be necessary in order to alleviate pressures of tokenism Black judges may experience in situations where they are extremely underrepresented.\n\n\n\nData:\n\nCircuit Court of Cook County in Illinois\n\nThe Circuit is composed of six municipal districts, with the First Municipal District covering the entire city of Chicago. A chief judge presides over the Circuit, which includes nonjudicial offices and the judiciary. The Criminal Division is responsible for hearing most of the county’s felony cases.\n\nThe Cook County, IL, Criminal Division data used for this project include just over 431,000 felony cases heard from 1995 to 2013\n\nin which the defendant was not found not guilty\n\nEach case is identified by a case number, and includes the following information: initiation date; defendant’s last name, date of birth, race, and sex; judge’s name; description of charge; felony class of the convicted charge; final disposition; length of minimum and maximum sentence; courthouse and number of the courtroom where the case was heard.\nThe vast majority of judges, for whom I could identify race and gender, are white (79%) and male (79%).\nI measure racial diversity on the bench as the percent of Black judges in the Criminal Division each year.\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\nLPM and OLS\n\n\n\n\nmethod specification\n\n\n\nwhere i and j represent a case and a judge, respectively.\nThe dependent variable in most of the models is dichotomous, taking a value of 1 if a defendant in a case is incarcerated to prison or jail and 0 otherwise.\nIn a few of the models, the dependent variable is sentence length, measured in days.\nThe main independent variable is the percent of Criminal Division judges who are Black each year, measured either across all three courthouses comprising the Division, or just in Chicago’s Leighton Building.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nI find that as the percentage of Black judges in a courthouse increases, white judges are less likely to render incarceration sentences in cases with Black defendants.\nThese shifts in judicial behavior shrink the Black–white gap in the probability of an incarceration sentence by up to 7 percentage points, greatly decreasing disparities in this outcome.\nSignificance only in the Chicago Leighton Building\n\nwhy dont they observe these in the suburban courthouses\n\nthey dont interact with their black colleagues at the chicago court house."

    "text": "But Lindsay seems almost suicidally frank at times; he will spend two hours on a stage, dutifully haranguing a crowd about whatever topic his speechwriters have laid out for him that day… and thirty minutes later he will sit down with a beer and say something that no politician in his right mind would normally dare to stay in the presence of journalists. - Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ’72, Hunter S. Thompson\n\nPresidential hopefuls jockey between each other in an effort to court attention and ultimately, voters to their campaign. This process plays out over many months where candidates travel up and down the United States interacting with different voters. As the quote from Hunter S. Thompson exemplifies, strategic candidates carefully craft their speeches to maximize their chances of getting elected while also staying true (as close as possible) to their own personal policy preferences. It is through campaign speeches, candidates attempt to match their policy preferences with the policy preferences of their respective audience. These speeches are the primary communication in which candidates attempt to publicize and codify their policy preferences.\nSimilar to Thompson in 1972, journalists will follow candidates, characterizing their speeches, behavior, appeal, and policy goals if elected president. Journalist on this beat attempt define the candidate politically. What is the candidates main goal? What subset of voters are they trying to capture? Where does the candidate land on fracking? How is the candidate doing in relation to X candidate? These journalistic accounts generally report the candidates from a ‘horse race’ perspective, providing insight into the strategies of the candidates and what is working/what is not (Gelman and King (1993)).\nCampaign speeches being the primary method for candidates to communicate their message to voters, provides valuable insight into what candidates perceive to be the most important issues for voters. Despite qualitative accounts from journalists, no known quantitative study has looked at campaign speeches across multiple elections and factors nor comprehensively compared what topics candidates focus on.\nBy studying the topics of campaign speeches, we gain a deeper understanding of what candidates think matter the most at different times and locations. Further, we can better characterize what each party values through the signals communicated by each party’s respective candidates. Descriptive knowledge of campaign speeches better will help provide a richer historical understanding of elections and help us learn what matters to different parties and voters from the perspective of the candidate.\nPrevious studies of campaigns, mostly look at evidence of a “campaign effect” - are campaigns important (Schmitt-Beck and Farrell (2003); Farrell and Schmitt-Beck (2003); Brady and Johnston (2009)). While important, this paper only looks at the campaign from the candidate perspective. This paper does not provide insight into how voters respond to the candidates, rather this paper helps us understand what factors motivate candidates to campaign the way they do.\nThis paper proceeds by first describing the role of campaign speeches and why modern candidates must participate in them. Second, I then use a keyword assisted topic model (keyATM) model across 12 defined policy topics to see how candidates vary across multiple dimensions in the topics they discuss through their campaign speeches. The corpus is sourced from The American Presidency project and includes all physical campaign speeches from every presidential candidate between 1999 - 2024. I provide theoretical justification for the various dimensions analyzed and how they might influence how candidates craft the speeches they do. After providing descriptive information of campaign speeches, I then reconfigure my data structure to estimate a multinomial logit model. While the descriptive information is interesting in its own right, I am curious about what factor is most influential in how candidates discuss policy topics. I find party identification to have the largest effect on what topics are discussed during campaign speeches. I finish with a brief explanation of my findings and further research goals."

    "text": "Topic Model Variation by Party\nGiven the period estimated is from 1999 to 2024, the parties have polarized ideologically and affectively (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes (2012); Layman, Carsey, and Horowitz (2006); Abramowitz and Saunders (2008)). Further, while these preferences have diverged, they have also varied considerably overtime. For example, the Republican party in 1999 is in many ways different from the party in 2024. Thus to observe differences across time between the parties, I characterize the parties more abstractly.\nParties have useful brands that communicate information to voters (Cox (2005)). These brands serve as heuristics to establish ideological identities and maintain voter loyalty. Grossmann and Hopkins (2016) argue these brands are driven by coalition differences between the two parties. Democrats having a more diverse coalition requires more targeted campaigning. Republicans are a ‘big tent’ coalition that thinks in more ideological terms and campaigns as such. I make an assumption that the party brands have mostly remained stable. Democrats represent more pragmatic and socially focused policies, while Republicans represent more idealistic policy preferences.\nFor example, Republicans prefer small government, less regulation, more economic freedom; Democrats prefer greater social liberties, and tighter control of markets. While there are undoubtedly changes that have occurred to how parties brand themselves, the general ideological branding of the party is mostly enduring. When characterizing the parties, voters appear to think of these party brands in a similar fashion.\nWhile no candidate is the same, candidates generally operate in a party framework. They are of course vying to represent the party nomination during the primary and then fully representing the party in the general election. Information provided from the keyATM will provide insight into how candidates from the two parties differ in what issues matter but will also provide greater insight into broader ideological differences between the parties. Given these characterizations of the party platforms, we should expect topics emphasized by Republican and Democratic candidates to reflect a similar result in their respective presidential campaign speeches.\nDemocratic Hypothesis: Democrats will emphasize civil rights, education, environment, labor, and finance topics with greater prevalence than Republicans.\nRepublican Hypothesis: Republicans will emphasize macro-economics, crime, agriculture, immigration with greater prevalence than Democrats."

    "section": "Topic Model Variation by Location",
    "text": "Topic Model Variation by Location\nTo communicate their message and increase attention to the campaign, candidates must regularly travel across the United States to promote themselves. Campaigning across the United States for the office of the presidency has been observed since in early presidential elections and continually growing in usage over American history. By traveling to different states, candidates meet different subsets of voters, elites, and media. Even during periods of high television and internet usage, where candidates are no longer physically restricted, candidates still regularly travel across states.\nWhy would location be a relevant factor for candidates? States in many regards serve as a proxy for audience type. Ideally, demographic data on the audience of each speech would be ideal, unfortunately, this data does not exist. Candidates travel to specific states because that state is needed to win and thus that audience is vital. During the campaign, states and their voters are usually characterized in a one dimensional manner. One example might be a state like Michigan where manufacturing and trade policies are usually characterized as the most salient issue by journalist because of the state’s deep relation to the car manufacturing industry. Given this characterization by journalist accounts, do we observe candidates speech content to similarly focus on these issues? It is likely the candidates do change the content of their speech to better reflect voter demographics. However, to what extent is unknown.\nFurther, campaign rallies are useful because it brings attention the campaign. Greater campaigning in a state can help diffuse information about the candidate to other voters through word of mouth or media coverage. Again, candidates have an immediate physical audience but also have an audience through this diffusion process.\nTo visualize how topics vary by location, I group states together into larger regions. I create different dummy variables for various regions. I group states together that are commonly associated with each other or have some common feature associated with them. For example, I create a dummy variable for the border states, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas). I then see how topics differ between border states and non border states. I show these results below with various regions below.\n\nTopic Prevalence in Border States\nBorder states refer to states that border the southern border with Mexico. These states include: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Geographic presence of a salient outgroup near an individual can increase political engagement and conservatism (Enos (2016)). Given these states are geographically closest to the Mexico border, the issue of immigration is likely a salient topic relative to non-border states.\nDespite these states sharing a border, states like California and Texas are massive in both population and geographical size. To say Northern California is similar to Southern California would be a mistake. If we had finer grained geographical data for where these speeches were given, we could better estimate the effect of immigration topic salience as the location gets closer to the Mexico border. Unfortunately, we only have location data by state. Thus, given the size of California and Texas generally commands greater topic discussion than just immigration, it may cloud our ability to differentiate immigration’s topic salience between border and non-border states. To test this, I create a dummy variable for border state speeches. I assign a 1 if the speech was given in a border state and a 0 if the speech was given in another state. Given what we know about border states, I hypothesize the following:\nBorder State Hypothesis: Candidates will discuss immigration more when in border states, relative to other topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic Salience in Rustbelt States\nThe “rust belt” refers to regions historically associated with steel, coal, and car industries. These regions were generally thought of as the manufacturing backbone of the United States and have been in decline as result of larger macro-economic/trade shifts. While they are related to specific areas within specific states; during the campaign, the Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are typically characterized as the “Rustbelt” states. Some classifications of the rust belt include New York and Missouri due to certain portions of their state associated with manufacturing. However, I do not include these states because the overall state is not generally characterized in this manner. Given what we know about this area of the United States, we should expect candidates to mostly talk about economics and trade. I hypothesize the following:\nRustbelt Hypothesis: Candidates will discuss macro-economics and trade more in Rustbelt states compared to non-Rustbelt states."

    "text": "Topic Model Variation by Candidate\nEven when from the same party, candidates vary wildly across policy preferences. To capture this variance for specific candidates, I provide key word assisted topic models for Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders. While there are numerous candidates to choose from, I focus on these two candidates because of their unique positions in their respective parties.\n\nDonald J. Trump\nDonald J. Trump shocked the political world in 2016 when he defeated Hillary Clinton for presidency. His campaign style was uniquely brash and unpredictable. Linguistic analysis of Trump find his speeches to be both more abstract and simple (Rong (2021)). His disdain for teleprompters and lack of formal speeches made his remarks more ‘stream of consciousness’ and ‘off the cuff’ relative to past presidential candidates. Many journalist following his campaign have similarly characterized his speeches and style as such.\nTrump established himself within the presidential race by making extreme comments regarding Mexico, immigration, Muslims, crime, and more. One of his key policies was to secure the southern border by building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. A previous study by Liu and Lei (2018) of Donald J. Trump’s speeches found a more negative tone compared to Hillary Clinton, further indicating the uniqueness of Trump as a candidate. While there is both qualitative and quantitative research documenting the extremity and focus of Trump’s policy positions, we do not know how much Trump emphasized these topics relative to other candidates across time.\nTo test this, I create a dummy variable for Trump’s speeches. I assign a 1 if Donald J. Trump is giving the speech and a 0 for all other candidate speeches. Given what we know about Donald J. Trump’s policies and unique rhetoric, I hypothesize the following:\nDonald J. Trump hypothesis: Donald J. Trump’s speeches will have a higher proportion of speeches related to immigration and crime, relative to other presidential candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\nThe independent senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, also surprised many in the 2016 Democratic primary. Hillary Clinton was the overwhelming favorite to win the primary and was expected to win with little resistance. However, Bernie Sanders’ campaign grew significant enough to pose a credible threat to Clinton’s presumed nomination. In many similar ways to Trump, Sanders represented himself as an outsider. Journalists characterized Sanders’ campaign message to be centered on economic, labor, and healthcare related issues. Even in the 2020 presidential primary, Sanders’ message was still remarkably consistent. Sanders called himself a ‘democratic socialist’, promoting greater union membership, medicare-for-all, and raising taxes on wealthy individuals. Despite these characterizations, we again do not how much more the Sanders campaign emphasized these topics relative to other candidates. To test this, I create a dummy variable for Sanders’ speeches. I assign a 1 if Bernie Sanders is giving the speech and a 0 for all other candidate speeches. Given what we know about Bernie Sanders through journalist accounts, I hypothesize the following:\nBernie Sanders Hypothesis: Bernie Sanders’ speeches will have a higher proportion of speeches related to macro-economics, healthcare, and labor, relative to other presidential candidates."

    "text": "Topic Model Variation by Election Type\nThere are stark differences in how candidates act during the primary and general elections. Primary elections are low information, occur at different time periods by state, more competitive, reduced turnout, and makeup a fundamentally different voting bloc than the general election. Because there are more candidates in a primary election, I expect greater variance in the topic prevalence.\nAfter the general election, candidates will usually shift their rhetoric and focus to the median voter (Downs (1957)). As campaign strategist James Carville’s famously explained in 1992, “its the economy stupid”; the greater economic focus during the general election is well documented (Kendall (2016)). This is not to say other topics are any less relevant to the candidate. However, because general elections are between two candidates (I ignore third party candidates), there is less variance in the topics discussed. Further, the audience in the general election is larger and more diverse. Thus, topics like agriculture, which might be location specific, are less salient in the general election as the candidate has to appeal more broadly. Thus, the economy being that category that is generally at the topic of the average voters mind, increases in salience relative to the other topic categories.\nI classify the start of the general election on the day of the National Convention for each party. The end of the general election is the date of the election. I create a dummy variable for election type. If the speech is between the respective convention date and the election date, I assign a 1 and 0 for all others. We are left with a vector of all speeches given during a primary coded as 0 and all speeches given during a general election as 1. Given what we know about the campaign differences between the primary and general election, I hypothesize the following:\nPrimary Election Hypothesis: During the primary election, more ‘niche’ topics will be prevalent, relative to general elections.\nGeneral Election Hypothesis: During the general election, greater macro-economic topic prevalence will occur, relative to primary elections."

    "text": "Final Review\n\nI provide the answer beneath each question. It is hidden in the foldable section under each question.\nDON’T LOOK AT ANSWER UNTIL YOU HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION.\n\nYOU ARE LEARNING NOT MEMORIZING!\n\nThese are topics I think are important for you to know. It is not comprehensive and you should consult other material (textbook, lecture, homework, etc.) when studying.\n\nthis is just one resource!\n\nUse this to guide you study but do not rely on it.\n\n\nWhat do you need help with?\n\nBefore we get into the questions I provide below, is there any topics you want me to cover more in depth?\n\n\n\nMy review questions for you:\n\nGeneral Questions:\n\nWhat is the point of statistics?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"To use data we have to tell us about data we don't have!\"\n\n\nI want to know how good students are doing in PSCI 2075. I sample only students in in my recitations. Is this an issue? Why?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Sampling only students in my recitation to make inferences about all students in PSCI 2075 would be problematic because I would have a selection bias. My sample is not a random sample. Students may differ in their grades because of different TAs. By only looking at my students, I fail to control for other factors (like having a different TA) on a student's grade. Thus the sample is not representative of the population of interest.\"\n\n\nAre random samples good? Why or why not?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"They are good. I won't tell you why here. You should go read about it from the book or earlier material/lecture notes to answer this question.\"\n\n\nThere are no randomized controlled experiments that show the effectiveness of parachutes. Should I jump out of this airplane without a parachute?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Do you really need to see the answer to this?\"\n\n\nTrue or False: Research questions must be falsifiable.\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"True.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistic Questions:\n\nWhat is an ordinal variable?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"A categorical variable that has a hierarchy between each category.\"\n\n\nThe mean, median, and mode are all measures of what?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Central tendency\"\n\n\nWhat is the difference between variance and standard deviation?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Standard deviation is the square root of variance.\"\n\"Variance is about the spread of the data; standard deviation standardizes the spread into one number.\"\n\n\nWhat axis does the dependent variable go on? What axis does the independent variable go on?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Dependent variable goes on the Y axis.\"\n\"Independent variable goes on the X axis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting Questions:\n\nJon wants to compare his students performance to Stone’s students performance. Jon has two variables. Using the description of the variables below, what plot should Jon create?\n\nstone_student_grades: a continuous variable containing the grade percentage of each of his students.\njon_student_grades: a continuous variable containing the grade percentage of each of his students.\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Because these are both continuous variables, Jon should create a scatterplot.\"\n\n\nPaul “Lisan Al-Gaib” Atreides wants to know the concentration of spice (melange) between the cities of Arrakeen and Sietch Tabr. With the information below, how should the Lisan Al-Gaib plot these variables?\n\n“city” is a binary variable\n“spice_concentration” is a continuous variable\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Because one variable is binary and the other is a continous, the Lisan Al-Gaib should create a boxplot.\"\n\n\n\"~the spice must flow~\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis Testing:\n\nCan you explain the Central Limit Theorem to someone? No like, literally, can you? Turn to a friend, neighbor, or call up your mom and see if you can explain it in a way that they would understand.\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Return to earlier weeks to review the concept. The central limit theorem is important! It is the mechanism that allows us to do hypothesis testing! Think about what the central limit theorem is and why it might be related to null hypothesis testing.\"\n\n\nWhat does the Central Limit Theorem allow us to do?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"The central limit theorem allows us to do hypothesis testing!\"\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of hypothesis testing?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"To use data we have to tell us about data we don't have! We use it to make inferences with our sample  data. Is this a real relationship or is this just a relationship I observe due to chance? Hypothesis testing helps us understand this connection.\"\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of having a null hypothesis?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"It provides a baseline to compare to. The null hypothesis represents the assumption of no relationship in the population. If the null were true, how likely are we to observe the sample we got? If it is unlikely for us to observe the sample we got (which we determine using the test stat and p-value) then it is improbable that we observed the sample to do chance.\"\n\n\nWhat is a p-value?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"A p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic value equal to or more extreme than the value you computed if the null were true.\"\n\n\nWhat is a confidence interval?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"The range of true values that would give our sample (or something\nfurther away) at least some portion of the time\"\n\n\"A confidence interval is the mean of your estimate plus and minus the variation in that estimate. This is the range of values you expect your estimate to fall between if you redo your test, within a certain level of confidence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression Questions:\n\nA regression has multiplication between two variables in it. What is that called?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Interaction\"\n\n\nHow many independent variables are included in a bivariate regression?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"One variable.\"\n\n\nWhat is the null hypothesis in Regression?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"beta = 0\"\n\n\nWhy do we add control variables?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"A control variable is an independent variable that you believe does not have a causal effect upon the dependent variable, but would potentially bias your results by excluding from your model (i.e. age, level of education, GDP per capita, population, etc.)\" \n\n\nI estimate a bivariate model between cigarette consumption and cigarette taxes. I don’t include age in my regression equation even though I think it is a theoretically important factor on the consumption of cigarettes by state. What type of bias is this an example of?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"This is considered an ommitted variable bias.\"\n\n\nWhat is a residual?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"The residual is the difference between our observed value and the predicted value (the regression line.) Note: the residual may also sometimes be called the error.\"\n\n\nWhat does the line of best (regression line) do?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"It minimizes the sum of squares. Hence the name OLS - Ordinary Least Squares\"\n\n\nCan we do a regression with a binary independent variable?\n\n\nShow the answer\n\"Yes! When we have a binary/categorical variable, we need to leave out one category. The category left out is our reference category.

The CES module provides a three person name generator asking question about who an individual talks to about politics and related demographic questions regarding those individuals. I specifically use the party identification of the name generator for each individual to construct the measure of political heterogeneity. Party identity can either be Republican, Democrat, or Other. Not all individuals identify three.\nI dummy out the measure of political heterogeneity, assigning a zero if the respondents identifies their political network to all be part of the same partisan identification, and assigning a one if the respondent’s network is not uniformly partisan."

    "text": "Independent Variable\n(Note for future self - you will need to use a different measure then the one used here. Think about what data you want to collect and how granular that measurement should be)\nTo measure the built environment I use population density by zip code. Previous studies on the effects of the built environment have varied over how to measure the concept. Measures include walkability indexes, car ownership by area, bike-able areas, cognability, street grids, and others (Finlay, Esposito, Langa, Judd, and Clarke 2022). What specific measurement to use is highly contextual on the research question and theory. This paper argues that built environment features increase stochastic political interaction and thus increases heterogeneity in people’s political network. I use population density measures from 2018 Census at the zip code level as my main IV. The Census does not explicitly provide this variable at the zip code level. Thus I take the population and divided by the land area of the zip code. This creates the population density measure.\nWhile my unit of analysis is the individual, the locational data I have for each individual is by zip-code. As a result, my measure of the built environment is restricted to the zip-code level. Zip code measures of the built environment are less common then census defined geographical aggregations. Thus, i measure the built environment using population density at the zip code level. While not ideal, population density captures some elements of how dense an area is. The assumption I make is that higher population density correlates with greater stochastic interaction as previously theorized by Jacobs (1992).\nUnfortunately, this assumption leads to measurement issues as it just captures how many people live in area rather than how the area is physically designed to structure how people interact. Because of this measurement, my question is shifted to asking how population density influences heterogeneity in political networks.\nSome evidence points to high population environments dampening social engagement (Oliver 2001). Just because an area has more people does not mean that area is designed to foster interaction, as a result the assumption I make for the purposes of this paper rests on shaky grounds. For this iteration of the paper, this is a shortcoming I am currently unable to overcome and will require substantial changes in future versions. (Note for future self: look across variables using principle component analysis.)"

However, one critical control variable is absent from the dataset and is sourced elsewhere, political sorting. How politically sorted an area is will influence the amount of stochastic interactions people have with someone from a different party.\nPolitical sorting is the phenomenon of individuals moving to neighborhoods with similar political identities. This paper is not concerned with why or how people politically sort into communities but is only concerned with its existence as a real phenomenon. Evidence supports the existence of people politically sorting into neighborhoods but differ about the prevalence and motivations behind it (Abrams and Fiorina 2012; Bishop and Cushing 2009; Brown and Enos 2021).\nTo account for political sorting, I use Brown and Enos (2021)’s measurement of partisan sorting by zip code. The measure provides the exposure of Democrats to Republicans by zip code. The measure also includes different geographical units that can be leveraged for future iterations of this paper.\nThe complete list of control variables included are:\n\nGeographical Sorting\nParty identification\nAge\nReligion\nGender\nEducation\nRace\nHome ownership"

A histogram below provides distribution of responses from the survey.\n\nHistogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation Measure\nHow does the built environment influence political isolation? While the module used in this paper did not provide an explicit measure of political isolationism, failure of the respondent to identify anyone within the name generator may be indication of political isolation. Of course, this also may be a survey issue where the respondent simply chooses not to identify anyone. This is not entirely clear but may be worth pursuing further.\n\n\nPolitical Sorting\nWhat is the exposure to out-group partisans in a geographically sorted neighborhood? Where do they cross paths? Do politically sorted communities have a more homogeneous network?\nIt might seem obvious that if you live in a homogeneous neighborhood, your political network is probably homogeneous as well. Not entirely clear. I think that is an assumption made by sorting literature but I am not sure if it has been fully fleshed out."

Economic rationality is a tool/lens to help us predict rational and irrational behavior.\nAs opposed to government’s impact on private decision making or the share of government in economic aggregates, Downs makes the point that government has not been successfully integrated with private decision-makers in a general equilibrium theory.\nThesis: Provide a behavior rule for democratic government.\n\nProvide such a rule by positing that democratic governments act rationally to maximize political support.\n\nWhat is economic rationality?\n\nA rational man is one who behaves:\n\n1) always makes a decision\n2) he ranks all alternatives in order of preferences.\n3) preference ranking is transitive\n4) always chooses that which ranks highest in his preference\n5) always makes the same decision each time he is confronted with the same alternatives\n\nthese assumptions are applied to all the players: political parties, interest groups, and governments.\n\nRationality: refers to the process of action, not to their ends or even to their success at reaching desired ends.\nAre inefficient men always irrational or can rational men also act inefficiently?\n\na mistaken rational man at least intends to strike an accurate balance between costs and returns; whereas an irrational man deliberately fails to do so.\nrational man corrects mistake if known and the cost of eliminating it is smaller than the benefits therefrom.\nif a man exhibits political behavior which does not help him attain his political goals efficiently, we feel justified in labeling him politically irrational, no matter how necessary to his psychic adjustments this behavior may be.\n\n\n\nThe Structure of the Model\n\nOur model is based on the assumption that every government seeks to maximize political support.\n\nperiodic elections are held\n\nprimary goal is reelection\nthe election is the goal of those parties now out of power.\n\nparty that receives the most votes controls the entire government until the next election.\nno intermediate votes\ngoverning party has unlimited freedom of actions.\ngovernment cannot hamper the operations of other political entities. (or freedoms)\nNo economic limits to its power.\n\nWith these assumptions, we can construct a model showing how a rational government behaves in the kind of democratic state we outlined above.\nThere is uncertainty in our “world”.\n\nuncertainty = imperfect information.\n\n“Thus our model could be described as a study of political rationality from an economic point of view. By comparing the picture of rational behavior which emerges from this study with what is known about actual political behavior, the reader should be able to draw some interesting conclusions about the operation of democratic politics.”\n\n\n\nThe Relation of our Model to Previous Economic Models of Government\n\nThis is kind of the warrant section for the article? Why do we need a new model? What do others do and why are they insufficient?\nPrevious models are normative.\nDowns model is positive. - deductive\nDowns discusses previous models, mainly focusing on Buchanan-Samuelson approach\n\nSamuelson posits two mutually exclusive ways to view decision making by the state:\n\n1) consider the state a separate person with its own ends not necessarily related to the ends of the individuals\n\nDowns disagree with this\n\n2) only individuals as having end structures. The state has no welfare function of its own; it is merely a means by which individuals can satisfy some of their wants collectively.\n\nDowns thinks this is partly true.\n\nthe individualistic view is incomplete because it doesn’t take coalitions into consideration.\n\n\n\n\nProblem: discovering a relationship between the ends of individuals at large and the ends of the coalition which does not restrict government to providing indivisible benefits. p.17\nOur model attempts to forge a positive relationship between individual and social end structures by means of a political device.\nin our model, government pursues its goal under three considerations:\n\na democratic political structure which allows opposition parties to exist\nan atmosphere of varing degrees of uncertainty,,\nand an electorate of rational voters.\n\nWe wish to discover what form of political behavior is a rational for the government and citizens of a democracy.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Party Motivation and the Function of Government in Society\n\nTheoretical models should be tested primarily by the accuracy of their predictions rather than by the reality of their assumptions.\n\ninteresting general point.\n\nAnand just provides one page of chapter 2 lol\n\n\n\nChapter 3: The Basic Logic of Voting\n\nIn order to plan its policies so as to gain votes, the government must discover some relationship between what it does and how citizens vote.\n\nThis is derived from the axiom that citizens act rationally in politics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThis implies that each citizen casts his vote for the party he believes will provide him with more benefits than any other.\n\nNeed to show what rational voting implies.\n\n\nUtility Income From Government Activities\n\nUtility is a measure of benefits in a citizen’s mind which he uses to decide among alternative courses of action.\n\na rational man always takes the one which yields him the highest utility.\n\nCitizens are utility maximizers.\nGovernment activity provides a utility income to citizens.\n\nincludes benefits they know and do not know they are receiving.\n\nhowever, only benefits which voters become conscious of by election day can influence their voting decisions; otherwise their behavior would be irrational.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Logical Structure of the Voting Act\n\nTerminology of the analysis:\n\nunit of time: election period.\n\ntime elapsed between elections.\n\n\n\n\nThe Two Party Differentials:\n\neach voter votes for the party they believe will provide him with a higher utility income than any other party during the coming election period.\n\nto find this, they compare the utility incomes they believe they would receive from each party.\n\n\\[E(U^A_{t+1}) - E(U^B_{t+1})\\]\nthis is the expected party differential\n\nif positive: vote incumbent\nif negative: vote opposition\nif zero: abstain.\n\nA rational voter bases their view of the future off the past/present.\n\nthus what is most important is the CURRENT party differential.\n\nutility the individual earned from the party at time \\(t\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trend Factor and Performance Ratings:\n\nTrend factor: the adjustment each citizen makes in his current party differential to account for any relative trend in events that occurs within the current election period.\nWhen the individual cannot see any difference between the two parties running\n\nto escape this, they alter their decision to whether or not the incumbents have done as good a job governing as did their predecessors in office.\n\nreminds me of a nature of the times voter in some fashion.\n\n\n\n\nRational men are not interested in policies but in their own utility incomes.\nPerformance ratings become a thing when the individual things the parties are the same.\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Difficulties Caused By Uncertainty\n\nThe world doesn’t have complete and costless information\n\nthere is uncertainty!\n\nIndividual can only estimate their utility income.\nThey will base them upon those few areas of government activity where the difference between parties is great enough to impress them.\nDowns excludes deliberate misinformation/disinformation.\nDowns assumes political tastes are fixed and only new information can change their mind.\n\n\n\nVariations in Multiparty System\n\nsame thing applies only the individual compares the incumbent against multiple parties.\nHowever, a rational voter not may vote for their preference because they another party may have a better chance of winning.\nAn important part of voting is predicting how other citizens will vote by estimating their preferences."

Definitely come back here.\n“We thus came to the conclusion that party changes are in the direction of greater consistency and homogeneity within subgroups. p.139”\nMaking an argument that in 1944, there was greater democratic machinery in Erie, causing more to side with democrats as opposed to 1940 which saw more side with republicans when their machinery was stronger.\nFUTURE STONE: XXXII -XXXIII YOU NEED TO READ AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT IS INCREDIBLY SUCCINT.\n\ndiscussion about cross-pressure, information gathering, social bridging, etc.\n\nindividuals who experienced cross-pressures took considerably longer to arrive at a definite vote decision.\n“In the present study we found that one of the functions of opinion leaders is to mediate between the mass media and other people in their groups. It is commonly assumed that individuals obtain their information directly from newspapers, radio, and other media. Our findings, however, did not bear this out. The majority of people acquired much of their information and many of their ideas through personal contacts with the opinion leaders in their groups. These latter individuals, in turn, exposed themselves relatively more than others to the mass media.\n\n\n\nChapter 1:\n\nGoal: Discover how and why people decide to vote as they did.\n\nWhat were the major influences upon them during the campaign of 1940?\n\nFocus: development of an individuals vote during the campaign.\n\nthis is going to bring up additional questions about attitude formation more broadly.\n\nData: Panel data - this is new at the time.\nSurvey data: individuals living in Erie county, Ohio 1940/1944.\n\n600 people - stratified sampling.\nthey were aware of interview frequency biasing results! back in 1940?!\nwould have liked the poll to have an extra month before the conventions.\ndifferent panels with different frequency of interviews.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2:\n\nDescribes the county of Erie.\ngoal is to know why people voted the way they did.\nSandusky - church was a major factor in life.\nmixed industrial and agriculture type.\nlabor as a political bloc was not very strong.\nNot a lot of solidarity among the ethnic groups within the county,\n1940 - republican campaign was more organized in the county than democrats,.\nproceeds to list important local, national, and international events for each half of the month.\n\nThis is interesting and I think works because the information flow is so much less than what we have now.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Social Differences Between Republicans and Democrats\n\nDifferent social cleavages and arrangements between the parties.\nQuestion: What exactly is the role of socio-economic status in the composition of the two parties.\nprevious socio-economic classifications in the literature are suspect.\nRicher people supported republicans more and poorer people supported democrats more.\nHow do people think of their social status vs. their actual social status?\n\nDo democrats on average, have greater congruence between their perceived social status and their actual? vice versa with republicans?\n\nThey then look at religion coupled with the socio-economic classifications.\n\nCatholics much more likely to be democratic\nwhat is the role of religion in today’s political landscape?\n\nis it still a strong cleavage?\n\n\n“Legend has it that older people are more conservative in most things, including politics, both because they like to perpetuate their own idealized past and because they have more to conserve.” p.23-24\n\na study that could separate these two mechanisms would be awesome!\n\nnot sure if it has been done before?\n\n“In other words, advancing age may not bring political conservatism but it does bring social conservatism.” p.25\n\nGives brief mention to rural/urban divide in vote choice.\n“There is a familiar adage in American folklore to the effect that a person is only what he thinks he is, an adage which reflects the typically American notion of unlimited opportunity, the tendency toward self-betterment, etc. Now we find that the reverse of the adage is true: a person thinks, politically, as he is, socially. SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS DETERMINE POLITICAL PREFERENCE.”\n\ninteresting point. Psychological mechanism at play. It isn’t just social characteristics perse, but how individuals PERCEIVE themselves socially -&gt; how they act politically.\n\nWhat is the congruence between their perception and actual?\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6: Time of Final Decision\n\nWhy do people decide who to vote for at different times?\nDelayed decision - had less interest in the election\nthose who made their choice late - subject to more cross-pressures.\nmore interest = the sooner they decide who to vote for.\n\nthey were also more likely to express anxiety.\n\nthis all is very similar to Campbell.\nThose who decide late were also less concerned about the ramifications of the election and who won.\nWhat cross-pressure will win out? That is which has more influence - religion or socio-economic status?\nThe different cross-pressures analyzed:\n\nReligion and SES level\nOccupation and Identification\n1936 and 1940 Vote\nThe voter and his family\nthe voter and his associates\n1940 Vote Intention and attitude Toward Business and Government\n\nWhy did people subject to cross-pressures delay their final decisions as to how they should vote?\n\nthe single biggest factor in delaying vote was the lack of complete agreement within the family.\nsecond, some are waiting for “events” to resolve the conflicting pressures\n\nI wonder how this squares with Gelman & King\n\nneed to revisit that.\n\n\n\n“We will recall that the people who make up their minds last are those who think the election will affect them least.” p.61\n“Our hypothesis that the person or the party that convinces the hesitant voter of the importance of the election to him personally-in terms of what he concretely wants-can have his vote.” p.61\n\nwe know from previous lit that, the voter might not know concretely what they want.\n\nAs the number of cross-pressures increases, the degree of interest shows a steady decline.\n\nthis is interesting. I wonder why this is.\nmaybe cross-pressures make it harder for the individual to realize the “fundamentals”."

Yet what the field collectively believes about this construct is based on dozens of studies using different indicators of knowledge. We identify two theoretically relevant dimensions: a temporal dimension that corresponds to the time when a fact was established and a topical dimension that relates to whether the fact is policy-specific or general. The resulting typology yields four types of knowledge questions. In an analysis of more than 300 knowledge items from late in the first decade of the 2000s, we examine whether classic findings regarding the predictors of knowledge withstand differences across types of questions. In the case of education and the mass media, the mechanisms for becoming informed operate differently across question types. However, differences in the levels of knowledge between men and women are robust, reinforcing the importance of including gender-relevant items in knowledge batteries.\n\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nPolitical knowledge is not as simple as we think.\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhat determines who is informed?\nHow does the temporal dimension relate to knowledge acquisition\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nLevels of knowledge for recent facts should be lower relative to facts that were established years or decades ago because there have been fewer opportunities for people to acquire such facts.\nWe expect that level of education will have a stronger (and more positive) relationship to general measures of political knowledge than it does to policy-specific knowledge.\nWe hypothesize that the effect of mass media on knowledge varies along the temporal dimension on figure 1.\n\nwe expect to observe a positive relationship between the amount of media coverage and surveillance facts, but little or no relationship between the level of media coverage and static facts.\n\nThe knowledge gap between men and women will be smaller for gendered questions compared with nongendered questions in each of the four cells.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present study provides a framework for understanding how the content or type of question affects observed levels of knowledge.\nPolitical Knowledge - Delli Carpini & Keeter’s definition - “The range of factual information about politics that is stored in long-term memory.\n\nHow does this differ from political sophistication?\n\nkeep this in mind.\n\n3 factors:\n\nability\nopportunity\nmotivations\n\n\nHow is a fact learned?\n\nfirst factor: how recently the fact came into being\nsecond factor: the type of fact - whether the question has to do with public policy concerns or the institutions and people/players of government (topical dimension).\n\nGeneral v. policy\n\nGeneral - questions ask about the institutions and people/players of government\n\nCarpini and Keeter emphasize the importance of general.\n\nPolicy-specific - whether the question has to do with public policy concerns\n\nGilens strong advocate\n\n“many people who are fully informed in terms of general political knowledge are nonetheless ignorant of policy-specific information that would alter their political judgments.”\n\npolicy specific is more domain-specific than general\n\nthus harder to acquire.\n\nthus need greater motivation to acquire that information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Know About Political Knowledge:\n\nAbility - level of education\n\nEducation was the “strongest single predictor of knowledge”\neducation has a direct effect on political knowledge and an indirect effect through political engagement and structural factoprs such as occupation and income.\nmost schools teach about institutions and processes of government.\n\nempirical analysis mostly looks at general political knoweldge.\n\nwe expect that level education will have a stronger (and more positive) relationship to general measures of political knowledge than it does to policy specific knowledge\n\nOpportunity - the amount of news coverage\n\nmore information available.\nDelli Carpini, Keeter, and Kennamer find that people living close to the capitol are more knowledgeable about state politics than those living farther away.\n\ninteresting! Is this a media story though? Or is this a geographical/physical interaction story?\n\nThe level of political knowledge increases as information about particular topics becomes more plentiful\n\nthere is an assumption here, that this information is “correct”.\nare we testing solely on events?\n\n\nMotivation - self- or group-interest\n\ngender gap in political knowledge.\n\nwhy?\n\nmight be because of the question we ask.\n\nwomen have much great knowledge when the question has direct relevance to women as a group.\nmechanism: women have higher levels of knowledge on “Gendered” questions as a result of the instrumental benefits of learning particular facts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData and Methods:\n\nOriginal dataset\nlots of observations (tens of thousands)\nsurveys were augmented with media content data and other controls.\nDepedent Variable: Knowledge\n\nPew research and Roper archives for surveys about knowledge in the later half of the 2000s\nquestions about public policy, people in office, etc.\n\nIndependent Variables: Question and Environmental level indicators\n\nEach knowledge question was coded for the two question-level characteristics appearing in fig 1. (surveillance vs. static and policy-specific vs. general).\n\ntemporal dimension: when the even occured - when the fact became established.\n\nwhen the person took office. When the bill passed. Last measure of unemployment prior to the question being asked in the survey.\n\nsurveillance facts were treated as those in which the correct answer was established 100 days prior to survey. all other questions were coded as static.\n\n43% surveillance and 57% static\nQuestions haveing to do with institutions of gov or people and players were coded as zero\n\ndomestic policies, actions by congress, or foreign policy topics = 1\n\n\nTo examine the effect of mass media on knowledge, we characterized the info environment for each topic.\n\nUse the Pew Research News Coverage Index (NCI) project.\n\nprovides a broad snapshot of which stories are being reported in the media at a given time and by who.\n\nThe media coverage variable is the NCI count of stories concerning a given knowledge question extending six weeks back in time. Thus, for a question asking which office Hillary Clinton holds in the beginning of June 2010, we counted NCI stories having to do with Hillary Clinton from roughly the middle of April until the field date of the survey. The six-week cutoff, though somewhat arbitrary, ensures that potential learning effects of current coverage are not misidentified due to less relevant levels of coverage in the past.\n\n\n\nAlso have individual level indicators\n\nedu range from 1 (least) to 8 (most)\nincome\nage\ngender\nrace\npartisanship\nthey used multiple imputation and averaged.\n\n\n\n\nResult:\n\nunit of analysis: a person’s response to a knowledge question.\nlogit model - outcome : which is the probability that individual i answers question j correctly.\n\na function of individual-level and question-level characteristics.\n\nuse random effects because to account for question clustering given by the same individual in survey questions.\nThey use fixed effects for certain \\(\\beta_j\\) which is income, age, black, democrat, and republican\n\\(n_j\\) represent question level random effects - which allow the effect of gender and education to vary across questions.\n\\(a_i\\) signifies an individual level random intercept (interpreted as the variation in individuals political knowledge)\n\nI thought this is our DV???????\n\n\\[\nPr(y_{ij}=1)=logit^{-1}(a_i+n^{cons}_j +n^{edu}_jEducation_i + n^{fem}_jFemale_i+\\beta_{inc}Income_i+\\beta_{age}Age_i+\\beta_{black}Black_i+\\beta_{dem}Democrat_i+\\beta_{rep}Republican_i)\n\\]\nFirst difference: represents how the probability of a correct answer changes as an explanatory variable moves from one substantively meaningful value to another.\n\n\nThe Effect of Education:\n\nincreasing education has a higher effect for general facts rather than for policy facts.\nprobability of getting the correct answer to a static-general knowldge question increases with education. This is bigger than static policy question\npeople with the most education remain ignorant of certain policy facts.\n“Level of education is positively related to knowledge in all four quadrants, but there are statistically significant differences in the strength of that relationship, precisely in the manner we expect.”\n\n\n\nLearning from Media Coverage:\n\nrecall the second hypothesis: the positive relationship between news coverage and knowledge stablished by previous studies will be largely confined to surveillance facts.\n\nmore news -&gt; more knowledge of surveillance facts.\nmore news not equal to more knowledge of static facts.\n\nObserve a large effect from a low to high media environment on surveillance-general facts is large.\nObserve a null effect on surveillance-policy facts.\n\n\n\nThe Gender Gap\n\nsmaller knowledge gap between genders on gendered questions.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nEducation does not confer the same benefits across different types of questions.\nMass media effect is largely confined to recent facts.\ngender knowledge gap is smaller when questions are gendered.\nWe should include knowledge questions along with the standard set of demographic items in all opinion survey."

They mistakenly infer that this fact invalidates my claim in “Homer Gets a Tax Cut” that “the strong plurality support” for the tax cut was “entirely attributable to simple ignorance.” Their analysis, like mine, implies that a fully-informed public would have been lukewarm, at best, toward the tax cut. They have little to say about why this is the case, beyond insisting that “citizens have reasons for the opinions they have.” I suggest that citizens’ “reasons” are sometimes misleading, misinformed, or substantively irrational, and that social science should not be limited to “attempts to better fit our analyses into their rationales.”\n\n\nBackground:\n\nBartels wrote “Homer Gets a Tax Cut”.\n\nLupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin write an article where they disagree with the findings. They claim Bartels’ makes an improper assumption.\n\nLiberals with more info did not support tax cuts while Rep with more info increased support of tax cuts.\n\n\nDebate about information effects on republicans/conservatives supporting Bush tax cuts.\nAccording to Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin, more informed republicans were roughly similar to less informed republicans on their views of tax cuts.\n\nthey found more informed dems v. less informed dems had a higher divergence.\n\nNES 2002 is not as reliable as other years. It was kinda bad this year.\nI certainly agree with Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin’s key claim that political information may have different effects on different people.\n\n\n\nDebate:\n\nBartels agrees with Lupia et al.’s claim that political information may have different effects on different people\nThey disagree on the “implications of this heterogeneity for my conclusions about the bases of support for the Bush tax cut.”\n\nthis is a mouthful.\n\nthey disagree over the conclusions about what Bartels has to say about people who support the Tax cut.\n\n\n“The fact that ideological and partisan disagreements about the tax cut only emerged clearly among relatively well-informed people will come as no surprise”\n\nI think he is basically saying that this is obvious and this is what Zaller shows.\n\nTHIS IS THE KEY POINT: “IN THE CASE OF THE BUSH TAX CUT, HOWEVER, UNINFORMED CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL VALUES WERE VERY LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE POLICY-IF THEY TOOK ANY POSITION AT ALL.\n\n\nMuch of Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin’s critique focuses on my claim that “the strong plurality support for Bush’s tax cut … is entirely attributable to simple ignorance.”\nIt does suggest that a fully-informed citizenry would have been lukewarm toward the tax cut, at best. Is that fact relevant to understanding\nBartels examines a variety of potential bases of public support for the Bush tax cut\nBartels argues they basically paraphrase his same argument.\nTheir analysis, like mine, implies that a fully-informed public would have been lukewarm, at best, toward the tax cut. They have little to say about why this is the case, beyond insisting that “citizens have reasons for the opinions they have.” I suggest that citizens’ “reasons” are sometimes misleading, misinformed, or substantively irrational, and that social science should not be limited to “attempts to better fit our analyses into their rationales.”\nLupia et al. unsubtle effort to, quite literally, change the subject is in service of a broader goal: rationalizing every political thinking and behavior.\n\nthe heart of their argument is that “citizens have reasons for the opinions they have”, and that we as social scientists should “conduct scholarship that attempts to better fit our analyses into their rationales.”\n\nBartels agrees we need to understand people’s rational. HOWEVER:\n\nhe seems to be arguing that these authors are making the point that all citizens can rationalize the opinions they have.\n\nit is this that he disagrees with:\n\n“However, decades of psychological research have amply demonstrated that people’s subjective understandings of their own behavior are often incomplete, predictably biased, and sometimes highly misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does not mean well-informed people should always be considered substantively rational.\n\nHere, as in many other instances, better-informed people seem mostly to have grasped the biased world-view of “their” political elites rather than an accurate perception of real social conditions\n\nYES I AGREE!"

Polit Behav 45, 781–804.\n\nAbstract:\nNumerous studies find associations between social media use and beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation. While such findings are often interpreted as evidence that social media causally promotes conspiracy beliefs, we theorize that this relationship is conditional on other individual-level predispositions. Across two studies, we examine the relationship between beliefs in conspiracy theories and media use, finding that individuals who get their news from social media and use social media frequently express more beliefs in some types of conspiracy theories and misinformation. However, we also find that these relationships are conditional on conspiracy thinking—-the predisposition to interpret salient events as products of conspiracies—-such that social media use becomes more strongly associated with conspiracy beliefs as conspiracy thinking intensifies. This pattern, which we observe across many beliefs from two studies, clarifies the relationship between social media use and beliefs in dubious ideas.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\n“We hypothesize that while social media is likely to spread conspiracy theories and some misinformation, such information will be most likely to translate into beliefs for those already attract to conspiratorial explanations for salient events.”\n\nok? BUT what is the mechanism that causes people to be more likely attracted to conspiratorial explanations?\n\nI need to see this for me to care (in my opinion)\n\n\nFor those who exhibit the lowest level of conspiratorial thinking, we should observe only a very weak relationship.\nH1: Those who use social media as their primary source for news and spend more time on social media will, all else equal, believe in more conspiracy theories and some misinformation than those who obtain news elsewhere and spend less time on social media platforms.\nH2: The impact of social media use is conditional on conspiracy thinking, such that the association between social media use and conspiracy beliefs is weaker for those exhibiting low levels of conspiracy thinking compared to those exhibiting higher levels.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\n(looking at the abstract) if social media use -&gt; more beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation; conditional on certain predispositions…\n\nwhat are those predispositions and what is the mechanism there.\n\nThat is the more interesting part in my opinion.\n\n\nThe predisposition for the adoption of conspiracy theories is conspiracy thinking.\n\n-   Conspiracy thinking is a latent predisposition to interpret events and circumstances as the product of malevolent conspiracies, a tendency to impose a conspiratorial narrative on salient affairs.\n\nSo social media increases belief in conspiracy theories and misinfo. when people exhibit higher conspiratorial thinking\n\nbut is this a supply argument? Social media just increases the amount if info that can be spread so…maybe then the mechanism for social media specifically increasing belief in conspiracy and misinformation is that it just provides a much greater supply.\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\n2 studies\nNational survey (n=2023)\nmarch 2020.\nexamine beliefs in 15 conspiracy theories and support of QAnon.\n\nquestions through Qualtrix.\n\n\n\n\nDependent Variable:\n\nbelief in # of conspiratory theories\n\n\n\nIndependent Variable:\n\nprimary source for finding news\nhow often in a typical week they visit or use (on a 5 point scale for each social media website.\nconspiracy thinking.\n\nfour item measure\n\n5 point scale - to four statements such as:\n\nMuch of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in secret places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Theory:\n\npartisanship\nideological self-identification\ninterest in politics\neducational attainment\nage\nhousehold income\ngender\nrace and ethnicity.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nThose who use social media as their primary source of news hold significantly more conspiracy beliefs, on average, than those who use any other medium.\nNewspapers also popped but have a large error bars.\nMoreover, the more frequently one engages social media platforms—-for news or otherwise—-the more conspiracy beliefs they tend to hold.\n“In model 3, we observe a statistically significant interaction between conspiracy thinking and frequency of social media use, though we do not observe a significant interaction between conspiracy thinking and use of social media-rather than other media-for news.”\n\nthis is interesting??!\n\ni wonder if this is an authority story.\n\nSocial media is democratic\n\n\n\nIndividuals must possess a belief system hospitable to conspiratorial information.\n\nthe more likely one is to see conspiracies in all manner of cultural and political events, the stronger the relationship between social media use and beliefs in dubious ideas.\n\nHave to have some attraction to conspiratorial explanations to be a necessary ingredient of conspiracy belief.\n“These patterns situate nicely within a growing body of literature finding that the effects of online misinformation and conspiracy theories are likely smaller than commonly assumed and concentrated among audiences exhibiting particular characteristics.”\n“Our findings run counter to the prevailing journalistic narrative that social media widely spreads conspiracy theories and misinformation, exposing unwitting consumers to dubious ideas who adopt them in short order.”\n\nbut what about repeated exposure overtime? The exposure and subsequent acceptance might be something that occurs over a time period.\n\nin this sense, conspiratorial thinking is socialized and not something inherent maybe?\n\nthey are fuzzy about conspiracy thinking.\n\n\nBut how is this not a supply story?"

The potential benefits and costs of five common political heuristics are discussed. A new dynamic processtracing methodology is employed to directly observe the use of these five heuristics by voters in a mock presidential election campaign. We find that cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex. A hypothesized interaction between political sophistication and heuristic use on the quality of decision making is obtained across several different experiments, however. As predicted, heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices. A situation in which experts can be led astray by heuristic use is also illustrated. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for strategies to increase input from under-represented groups into the political process.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhat are the individual and contextual determinants of heuristic use?\nDoes the use of heuristics affect (without prejudging whether it improves or hinders) the quality of political decision making\n\n\n\nFive Political Heuristic:\n\nParty affiliation\ncandidate’s ideology\nEndorsements\npolls\n\nprovide “viability” info\n\nCandidate appearance\n\nDukakis in the tank.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nwe hypothesize that the use of cognitive heuristics generally will be associated with higher quality decisions\nwe expect heuristic use to be most efficacious for political experts\nthe use of cognitive heuristics will interact with political sophistication to predict higher quality decisions\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nscrolling for info."

    "text": "Lupia, Arthur et al. 2007. “Were Bush Tax Supporters ‘Simply Ignorant?’ A Second Look at Conservatives and Liberals in ‘Homer Gets a Tax Cut.”’ Perspectives on Politics. 5(4): 773-784.\n\nAbstract:\nIn a recent issue of Perspectives on Politics, Larry Bartels examines the high levels of support for tax cuts signed into law by President Bush in 2001. In so doing, he characterizes the opinions of “ordinary people” as lacking “a moral basis” and as being based on “simple-minded and sometimes misguided considerations of self interest.” He concludes that “the strong plurality support for Bush’s tax cut … is entirely attributable to simple ignorance.”\nOur analysis of the same data reveals different results. We show that for a large and politically relevant class of respondents, conservatives and Republicans, rising information levels increase support for the tax cuts. In fact, Republican respondents rated “most informed” supported the tax cuts at extraordinarily high levels (over 96 percent). For these citizens, Bartels’ claim that “better-informed respondents were much more likely to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut” is untrue. Bartels’ results depend on the strong assumption that if more information about the tax cut makes liberals less likely to support it, then conservatives must follow suit. Our analysis allows groups to process information in different ways and can better help political entrepreneurs better reconcile critical social needs with citizens’ desires.\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow does information acquisition (and to what level) influence support/opposition to policies?\nAre voters stupid? RE: Bartels\n\n\n\nBartels Argument:\n\nBartels claims that “better-informed respondents were much more likely to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut”\nHe argues that if Americans had been more enlightened, greater numbers would have opposed the cuts.\nBartels characterizes the opinions of “ordinary people” as being superficial and based on “simple-minded and sometimes misguided considerations of self-interest.”\n“Finally, and most importantly, better-informed respondents were much more likely to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut…If we take this crossectional difference in views as indicative of the effect of information on political preferences, it appears that the strong plurality for Bush’s tax cut…is entirely attributable to simple ignorance.”\n\n\n\nAuthors argument:\n\nThey disagree with Bartels.\nthey agree regarding the role of information in determining how voters support or oppose policies.\nThey point to issues with 2002 NES survey.\n\nlower budget in this survey and thus less political information questions were asked.\n\nnote: is political information questions = to political knowledge questions?\n\n\nBoth use post election interviewer ratings as an instrument for pre-election interviewer ratings to minimze the probability that the rating is contaminated by a respondent’s answers to the tax cut and inequality questions, where were asked in the pre-election survey.\nThey find: for Republicans/conservatives with higher information ratings had no significant effect on support for the tax cut or correspond to increase support for cuts.\nFor Dem/liberal - the claim that better informed respondents were much more liekly to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut is simply untrue.\nBartels conclusion rests on an assumption he makes about how information impacts public opinion:\n\nHe restricts all respondents—whether liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat—to respond to increasing information levels in an identical way. Must changes in information levels have such universal effects? Or is it possible that on issues such as the merit of a tax cut proposal, reasonable people can disagree?\n\nBartels assumes all respondents must respond identically to the added info.\n\nAuthors: “but often in politics, and perhaps distinctively in politics, there is a clash of perspectives, values, and views about how society works.\n\nthere is also a cognitive element going on that isn’t being discussed. I am thinking of a taber & lodge angle to this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors findings/theory:\n\nVery few respondents scored below average on political information scale.\nAs republicans achieve higher information scores, their support for the tax cut increases.\n\nthis result is flipped and more stark for democrats.\n\nBartels claims that ignorance explains the overwhelming support for the tax cuts. Figure 2 suggests a different story. For liberals, higher information ratings correspond to more tax cut opposition. For conservatives, the same is not true.\nBartels findings are based on an assumption about information that is questionable as a general matter and is falsified by the data.\nDid Bartels just not separate out the data between Republicans and Democrats?\n1 = strongly support tax cut, .5 = support tax cut -.5 = oppose tax cut, -1 = strongly oppose tax cut.\nBartels makes an a priori assumption about how different partisan and ideological groups should react to different amounts of information.\nThey run separate regressions for liberals and conservatives.\nIn columns 3 through 6, increasing information ratings makes liberals and Democrats less likely to support the tax cut. However, higher information ratings have no significant effect on conservative or Republican support for the tax cut. Put another way, reasonable people (e.g., highly informed liberals and highly informed conservatives) can disagree—and in this case they did. Only liberals react as Bartels predicts. Other respondents react quite differently.\nThey don’t think Bartels’ description of citizens as “simple-minded”, “unenlightened”, “superficial” etc. is not the best.\n\nno single agreed upon axiom for economics or policy to be “correct”\nrespondents don’t just think about one policy.\njust because people don’t have opinions of tax cuts does not mean they are simple minded.\n\nSome considerable pushback about voters being solely economic driven.\nThey take issue with Bartels’ conclusions on voters."

A model of the survey response is proposed which takes account of the vagueness in opinion survey questions and in response categories. When estimates are made of this vagueness or “measurement error” and the estimates applied to the principal previous study, nearly all the inconsistency is shown to be the result of the vagueness of the questions rather than of any failure by the respondents.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nSurvey design can lead to different results!\nAlso, Converse missed some important methods considerations.\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhat are possible sources for why there is weak correlation among citizens’ political survey responses?\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\n“There can be little doubt that the sophisticated electorates postulated by some of the more enthusiastic democratic theorists do not exist, even in the best educated modern societies”\nBeliefs may be best expressed on a continuum.\nWe use likert scales but these are discrete representations of a continuous preference.\n\nAs a result, it is unsurprising this leads to respondents appear to be inconsistent in their beliefs.\n\nWe usually just chalk this up as measurement error\n\nAchen: “…it reflects a flaw in the survey research method rather than in responses of subjects.”\n\nHe argues Converse did not contend with these issues and thus underestimates voters’ attitudinal stability.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two theories about instability in respondents political survey questions:\n\n1) voters actually have instability in their opinions/belief system.\n\nThis is Converse’s argument\n\n2) low reliabilities of opinion survey question\n\nThis is Achen’s argument contribution.\n\n\nBIG ISSUE FOR ACHEN: the vagueness of the questions asked.\n\n\n\nData/Method:\n\nConverse’s data\n1132 respondents\n“When a voter is stable in his views and all observed variability is measurement error, correlations will be equal across time periods. At the other extreme, when a voter is unstable and there is no measurement error, correlations should become smaller at a predictable rate as time periods become more distant from each other.”\n\nBasically:\n\nsmaller correlations between periods means genuine changes in belief.\n\ntime 1 should NOT have more predictive power than time 2 for time 3\n\nconsistent beliefs means that time 1 or time 2 should not be better than the other at predicting time 3.\n\ncorrelation is equal across time periods!\n\n\n\nI am a bit confused by the model - \\(p_t\\) represents the actual opinion at time t of the respondent. But we cannot know this? We only have the observed opinion represented at \\(x_t\\)\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nVoters’ beliefs are a bit more stable than we thought\n\nthis does not mean voters have more wisdom.\n\nThis article says nothing about a voter’s sophistication\n\nonly that there beliefs are a bit more stable than what Converse initially articulated.\n\n“Here the problem with the weak original correlations is demonstrated to lie, not with the variability of respondents, but rather with the fuzziness of the questions and with other errors of measurement.”\nThis only works for panel data I think.\nThe simplicity of questions and the fact that respondents might have preferneces on a continuum that don’t perfectly map onto the likert scale categories that might be driving this “measurement error.”\n\nNeed to figure this out.\n\nhow does the question get interpreted by different individual factors?\n\nmeasurement error is DV\nIV = independent variables - Education/income.\n\nshould expect “better-off” members of the electorate to have lower expected measurement errors.\nthere are a lot more IVs.\n\n\n\nHowever, they find that these individual factors have little to no predictive power in explaining measurement error.

New York: The Free Press.*\n\nChapter Reading: The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics\n\nFocus: measurement strategies for belief systems.\n\n“Our focus in this article is upon differences in the nature of belief systems held on the one hand by elite political actors and, on the other, by the masses that appear to be “numbered” within the spheres of influence of these belief systems.\n\nThesis: There are important and predictable differences in ideational worlds as we progress downward through such “belief strata” and that these differences, while obvious at one level, are easily overlooked and not infrequently miscalculated.\nThey don’t like “ideology”\nBelief System: a configuration of ideas and attitudes in which the elements are bound together by some form of constraint or functional interdependence.\nConstraint: the success we would have in predicting, given initial knowledge that an individual holds a specified attitude, that he holds certain further ideas and attitudes.\n\nbasically logical constraint is what they are getting at.\n\nbut there are others.\n\n\nCentrality: idea elements within a belief system vary in a property we shall call “centrality”, according to the role that they play in the belief system as a whole.\n\n\n\nII. Sources of Constraint on Idea-Elements\n\nlogical inconsistencies are far more prevalent in broad public.\nclassical logic: if x then y. or this must follow if z.\n\n\nPsychological Sources of Constraint\n\nnot classically logical.\nSeems to be driving at a sort of cultural constraint.\nthe “logic of culture”. morals/ethics\n“What is important is that the elites familiar with the total shapes of these belief systems have experienced them as logically constrained clusters of ideas, within which on part necessarily follows from another.”\n\n\n\nSocial Sources of Constraint\n\n“In the case of the belief system, arguments are developed to lend some more positive rationale to the fact of constraint: The idea-elements go together not simply because both are in the interest of the person holding a particular status but for more abstract and quasi-logical reasons developed from a coherent world view as well. It is this type of constraint that is closest. to the classic meaning of the term”ideology”.\nSecond source of social constraint: idea elements of a belief system are diffused in packages.\n\n“if you believe this, then you will also believe that, for it follows in such and such ways”\n“communists are atheists” - a lot of people would believe this but wouldn’t coherently be able to tell you why.\n\nDiffusion of information\n\ndifferent levels of info.\n\nmost get the first level which is just the statement\nhowever, most won’t get the contextual information to support the claim. the “why”\n\ninformation is super important. How it trickles down but also how different people consume it!\n\n\n\n\nConsequences of Declining Information for Belief Systems\n\nPrimary Thesis: as one moves from elite sources of belief systems downwards on such an information scale, several important things occur:\n\n1) the contextual grasp of “standard” political belief system fades out very rapidly.\n\nconstraints decline across the universe of idea-elements.\n\n2) The character of objects that are central in a belief system undergoes systematic change.\n\nthese objects shift from the remote, generic, and abstract to the increasingly simple, concrete, or “close to home”.\nInterest paragraph - i don’t know if I buy this:\n\n“Such observations have impressed even those investigators who are dealing with subject matter rather close to the individual’s immediate world: his family budgeting, what he thinks of people more wealthy than he, his attitudes toward leisure time, work regulations, and the like. But most of the stuff of politics-particularly that played on a national or international stage- is, in the nature of things, remote and abstract. Where politics is concerned, therefore, such ideational changes begin to occur rapidly below the extremely thin stratum of the electorate that ever has occasion to make public pronouncements on political affairs. In other words, the changes in belief systems of which we speak are not a pathology limited to a thin and disoriented bottom layer of the lumpenproletariat; they are immediately relevant in understanding the bulk of mass political behavior.” p.213 towards the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. Active Use of Ideological Dimensions of Judgment.\n\nDifferent levels:\n\nideologue\n\nrespondents who did indeed rely in some active way on a relatively abstract and far-reaching conceptual dimension as a yardstick which political objects and their shifting policy significance over time were evaluated.\n\nsemi-ideologue\n\nrespondents who mentioned such a dimension in a peripheral way but did not appear to place much evaluative dependence upon it or who used such concepts in a fashion that raised doubt about the breadth of their understand of the meaning of the term.\n\nGroup interest\n\nrespondents who failed to. rely upon any such over-arching dimensions yet evaluated parties and candidates in terms of their expected favorable or unfavorable treatment of different social groups in the population.\n\nNature of the times\n\ndemocrats made economy bad i vote republican now.\n\nNonsensical\n\nvoters who just said random stuff basically.\n\n\n\n\n\nV. Constraints among Idea-Elements.\n\nmore sophisticated = more constraints.\nmass public does not share ideological patterns of belief with relevant elites at a specific level any more than it shares the abstract conceptual frames of reference.\n\n\n\nVI. Social Groupings as Central Objects in Belief Systems\n\nDifferences in the objects that have centrality in a belief system.\nfor bulk of mass public, the object with highest centrality is the visible.\n\ninteresting point. I think this is still true.\n\n“it might be deduced that nationalist ideologies stand a much better chance of penetrating a mass population than would…for nationalist ideologies hinge upon a simple group object in a way that single-tax notions do not. p.237\nThe nation as a bounded, integral group object is difficult to experience in any direct way, and its psychological existence for the individual depends upon the social transmission of certain kinds of information.\n\nreminds me of Benedict Anderson - imagined communities.\n\n\n\nOther Info\n\nthe most active and hardcore does not mean sophisticated!\n“Nonetheless, persistent and varied participation is most heavily concentrated among the most sophisticated people. This fact is important, for much of what is perceived as”public reaction” to political events depends upon public visibility, and visibility ddpends largely upon forms of political participation beyond the vote itself.” p.226\nThe “visible” or “operative” public is largely made up of people from the upper left-hand corner of our preceding tables. The illusion that such people are the full public is one that the democratic sample survey, for better or for worse, has destroyed.\n“For the truly involved citizen, the development of political sophistication means the absorption of contextual information that makes clear to him the connections of the policy area of his initial interest with policy differences in other areas; and that these broader configurations of policy positions are describable quite economically in the basic abstractions of ideology. Most members of the mass public, however, fail to proceed so far.”\nThe common citizen fails to develop more global points of view about politics."

Despite decades of scholarship, researchers have failed to reach a consensus. Researchers agree that policy opinions in surveys are unstable but disagree about whether that instability is real or just measurement error. In this article, we revisit this debate with a concept neglected in the literature: knowledge of which issue positions “go together” ideologically—or what Philip Converse called knowledge of “what goes with what.” Using surveys spanning decades in the United States and the United Kingdom, we find that individuals hold stable views primarily when they possess this knowledge and agree with their party. These results imply that observed opinion instability arises not primarily from measurement error but from instability in the opinions themselves. We find many US citizens lack knowledge of “what goes with what” and that only about 20%–40% hold stable views on many policy issues.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhat share of citizens hold meaningful views about public policy?\nWhat is the source of instability in survey measures of the public’s policy opinions?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe knowledge of what goes with what plays an important and under-appreciated role in attitude stability.\n\nWhen people learn what goes with what (which policy positions are Republican and which are Democratic), they will tend to exhibit stable policy views.\n\nThose who do not know elite positions should generally have less stable views, even when we measure their attitudes with multi-item scales.\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nDebate in lit about question\nZaller & Zaller & Feldman argued that opinion instability results from citizens holding conflicting considerations on policy issues and then sampling from these pools of inconsistent considerations when they answer survey questions.\nOthers argue (Achen) that people do hold meaningful opinions but is ambiguous due to measurement error.\nIf citizens lack meaningful views about even the most salient political issues, instead having their opinionsontheseissueseasilychangedbypoliticalelites and the media, “democratic theory loses its starting point” (Achen 1975, 1220).\nIn this article, we show that this long line of research has yielded mixed results because it has examined opinion stability by general political knowledge, a poor proxy for what we believe drives attitude stability.\n\nwhat goes with what\n\nPeople adopt the heuristics and follow the leaders\n\nvery top-down driven mechanism for attitude stability.\n\n\n\n\nData/Method:\n\n\nResults:\n\nWe find that a large segment of the public lacks knowledge of “what goes with what,” and consequently a large segment lacks stable policy views on salient issues.

In particular, is the utility of partisan and ideological reasoning contingent on the accessibility of an individual’s own self-identifications? Are people with accessible points of ideological and partisan orientation more likely to in voke these orientations in formulating political judgments and resisting efforts at political persuasion? Are they more likely to demonstrate politically compatible points of orientation? These questions are addressed in the context of a study conducted during the course of the 1996 election campaign. In order to measure the accessibility of respondents’ partisan and ideological self-identifications, we record response latencies-the time re quired for respondents to answer particular questions. Based on our analysis, we argue that attitudes and self identifications are useful heuristic devices that allow individuals to make sense out of the complexity and chaos of politics. But some citizens are better able than others to employ these devices, and by demonstrating who these citizens are, the concept of accessibility becomes an important element in the explanation of political capacity.\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nWhat is the key to the political capacity of citizens?\nAre ideological and partisan orientations only important for those individuals who are able to distinguish themselves as strong partisans or strong ideologues, at the extreme points of the respective scales?\nIs the utility of partisan and ideological reasoning contingent on the accessibility of an individual;s own self-identifications? Are people with accessible points of orientation more likely to invoke partisanship and ideology in formulating political judgments and resisting efforts at political persuasion? Are they more likely to demonstrate politically compatible points of orientation?\nDoes everyone possess a library of heuristic devices to use in uncertain circumstances? Under what circumstances is such a device likely to be most useful?\nHow might an individual confront government support for the arts absent such an ideological orientation?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nOur argument is that the political relevance and heuristic utility of an attitude or an identification is directly related to its accessibility in the memory of an individual.\nSuch ideological orientations become more useful if they readily come to mind when an individual confronts a situation requiring a political decision or judgment.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nThe explicit or implicit lesson has been that strong ideologues and strong partisans are better able to exercise the duties of citizenship because they are better able to invoke clear principles when tthey are confronted with complex political issues.\nConverse:\n\n1) many citizens do not think in ideological terms\n2) many demonstrate a high level of temporal instability in their opinions\n3) many hold inconsistent opinions on seemingly related issues.\n\nQuestions have shifted to asking what manner can incapable citizens are able to reach political decisions.\naccessible opinions, identitifications, and orientations are distinguished by their position within long-term memory.\n\nthey are accessible because they are readily and easily available within individual cognitive structures (or schemas), and hence they are readily retrieved.\n\n\n\n\nData/Methods\n\nprevious studies have measured accessibility through the latency of the answer.\n\nhow long did it take the individual to answer the question - tracked through mouse/click time.\n\nthe latency is the measure of accessibility.\n\n\nData: 1996 election campaign\n2 samples\n\nsample one: n = 2174\nand a one stage snowball sample of these main respondents’ discussants n = 1475\n\ndrawn from the indianapolis metro area\nst louis metro area\n\n\n25 min interview\ntimed using latent timer which recorded the elapsed time between answers to two sequenced questions.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nCitizens who readily think about politics in partisan or ideological terms are better able to employ these points of orientation as useful heuristic devices in making sense out of the complexity and chaos of politics.\nIn contrast to a model of online processing, our analysis builds on the idea that some citizens are unable to provide affective responses to opinion objects, while others-citizens with accessible heuristics-are able to for mulate responses on the spot using these heuristic devices"

We suggest a more realistic standard: Citizens fulfill their democratic duties if most of the time, they vote “correctly.” Relying on an operationalization of correct voting based on fully informed interests, we present experimental data showing that, most of the time, people do indeed manage to vote correctly. We also show that voters’ determinations of their correct vote choices can be predicted reasonably well with widely available survey data. We illustrate how this measure can be used to determine the proportion of the electorate voting correctly, which we calculate at about 75% for the five American presidential elections between 1972 and 1988. With a standard for correct vote decisions, political science can turn to exploring the factors that make it more likely that people will vote correctly."

    "text": "Zaller, J. and s. Feldman. 1992. “A Simple Model of the Survey Response: Answering Questions versus Revealing Preferences.” American Journal of Political Science. 36: 579-616.\n\nAbstract:\nOpinion research is beset by two major types of “artifactual” variance: huge amounts of overtime response instability and the common tendency for seemingly trivial changes in questionnaire form to affect the expression of attitudes. We propose a simple model that converts this anomalous “error variance” into sources of substantive insight into the nature of public opinion. The model abandons the conventional but implausible notion that most people possess opinions at the level of specificity of typical survey items-and instead assumes that most people are internally conflicted over most political issues-and that most respond to survey questions on the basis of whatever ideas are at the top of their heads at the moment of answering. Numerous empirical regularities are shown to be consistent with these assumptions.\n\n\nBumper Sticker\nVoters do not (for the most part) have preformed attitudes and make it up when confronted on a survey.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nHow sophisticated are voters?\nAre they consistent?\nDo surveys properly capture sophistication?\nHow do we develop a model that accommodates both response instability and response effects and that is crafted to the kinds of problems and data facing analysts of public opinion?\nAccording to conventional attitude theory, individuals choose whichever prespecified option comes closest to their own position. But if, as we contend, people typically do not have fixed positions on issues, how do they make their choices?\n\n\n\nHypothesis/Argument:\n\nMost citizens, we argue, simply do not possess preformed attitudes at the level of specificity demanded in surveys.\n\nThey carry around in their heads a mix of only partially consistent ideas and considerations.\n\nwhen questioned, they call to mind a sample of these ideas, including an oversample of ideas made salient by the questionnaire and the other recent events, and use them to choose among the options offered . But their choices do not, in most cases, reflect anything that can be described as true attitudes; rather, they reflect the thoughts that are most accessible in memory at the moment of response.\n\n\nThe heart of our argument is that for most people, most of the time, there is no need to reconcile or even to recognize their contradictory reactions to events and issues.\n\neach represents a a genuine feeling, capable of coexisting with opposing feelings and, depending on its salience in the person’s mind.\n\n\n\n\nContext/previous research:\n\ncitizens don’t have very well informed attitudes. some debate of this. see Achen and Converse.\nPeople are inconsistent in survey responses over time. Why?\nConverse argues large portions of an electorate do not have meaningful beliefs even, even on issues that have formed the basis for intense political controversy among elites for substantial periods of time.\n\nAchen disagrees a bit.\n\nthey are stable but there is error as a result of survey design/issues.\n\nmapping true attitudes to vague langue of survey questions is hard.\n\n\n\nAchen assumes that all respondents have “true attitudes”\nQuestion ordering influences all levels of respondent.\nSurveys frame issues and make certain things salient.\nHochschild particularly emphasizes ambivalence in many of her respondents\n\nthis ambivalence is interesting.\n\nthey are being probed for the opinion but the ambivalence shows the need for a discourse to reach a conclusion.\n\n\na schema is a cognitive structure that organizes prior information and experience around a central value or idea and that guides the interpretation of new information and experience\n\nthis kind of sounds like a belief system or at least closely related.\n\nZaller’s model will follow the assumption of ambivalence in people’s political beliefs.\n\n\n\nAxioms\n\nThe ambivalence axiom. Most people possess opposing considerations on most issues, that is, considerations that might lead them to decide the issue either way.\nThe response axiom. Individuals answer survey questions by averaging across the considerations that happen to be salient at the moment of response, where saliency is determined by the accessibility axiom.\nThe accessibility axiom. The accessibility of any given consideration depends on a stochastic sampling process, where considerations that have been recently through about are somewhat more likely to be sampled.\n\n\n\nDeductions:\n\nWe should find that people are, in general, more politically involved have more considerations at the top of their heads and available for use in answering survey questions.\nwe would expect persons who have greater interest in an issue to have, all else equal, more thoughts about that issue readily accessible in memory than other persons.\n\ndont have good data for this but have some\n\nWe should find strong correlations between measures of people’s thoughts as they answer a survey item and the direction of decision on the item itself.\nIf as the model claims, individuals possess competing considerations on most issues, and if they answer on the basis of whatever ideas happen to be at the top of their minds at the moment of response, one would expect a fair amount of over-time instability in people’s attitude reports.\nCitizens would have central tendencies that are stable over time, but their attitude statements would fluctuate greatly around these central tendencies.\nAttitude reports formed from an average of many considerations will be more reliable indicator of the underlying population of considerations than an average based on just on one or two considerations\nPeople should be more stable in their responses to close-ended policy items conserning doorstep issues-that is, issues so close to everyday concerns that most people routinely give some thought to them.\nGreater ambivalence ought to be associated with higher levels of response instability.\nIf, as the model claims, people are normally ambivalent on issues but answer on the basis of whatever ideas are most accessible at the moment of answering, raising new considerations in immediate proximity to a question should be able to affect the answers given by making different considerations salient.\nMost ambivalent - are the people that should be most strongly affected by artificial changes in question order.\nThe tendency of people to base attitude reports on the ideas that are most immediately salient to them, as specified in Axioms 2 and 3, well explains such effects.\nrace of interviewer effects\nreference group effects\npriming effects of television news\nframing effects of question wording and question order\nHaving had their ideological orientations made salient to them just prior to answering policy items, those respondents who possess such orientations are more likely to rely on them as a considerations in formulating responses to subsequent policy questions, thereby making those responses more strongly correlated with their ideological positions and hence also more ideologically consistent with one another.\nWe therefor expected that responses following the stop-and-think treatment would be, all else equal, more reliable indicators of the set of underlying considerations than responses made in the standard way, that is, in the retrospective condition.\n\nstruggle to confirm this one.\n\n\n\n\nResults/Findings:\n\nThe conflicts most responsible for response instability is conflict that occurs across rather than within interviews and that respondents are often unaware of their conflict as they answer questions.\n\n\n\nOther:\n\nmention of the “on-line” model/ people use a judgment operator to update continuously their attitudes “on-line” as they acquire new information.\n\nPeople are said to store their updated attitudes in long-term memory and retrieve them as required, rather than, as in our model, create attitude statements on the spot as they confront each new survey question.\n\nThey are still skeptical about this because citizens must answer such a large variance of questions on survey for the on-line processing of all relevant information."

In the cur rent research, we develop a quarterly time series measure of trust in the U.S. national government from 1980 to 1997 and conduct the first multivariate time series examination of public trust in government. We find that negative perceptions of the economy, scandals associated with Congress, and increasing public concern about crime each lead to de clining public trust in government. Declining trust in government in turn leads to less positive evaluations of Congress and reduced support for government action to address a range of domestic policy concerns. These results provide new evidence of the influence of public concern about crime and the centrality of Congress in understanding public evaluations of the national government and new evidence of how de clining levels of trust in government may influence elections and do mestic policy making.\n\n\nBumper Sticker\n\nwe find that trust in government is importantly influenced by political scandals and public perceptions of the economy and crime\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat are the causes in the variation of public trust?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nWe hypothesize that as the proportion of the public mentioning crime as the nation’s most important problem rises, trust in government will fall.\n\ni am thinking about suburbia.

In particular, the model I test posits that cultural intolerance constrains the liberty of individual citizens. Focusing on how people perceive political freedom, several hypotheses coupling tolerance and freedom are explored. Data from a national survey show that toderance and freedom are connected. Those who do not feel free to express themselves politically are more likely to be intolerant of others, to have less heterogenous peer groups and less tolerant spouses, and to live in less tolerant communities. Ultimately, the importance of mass political intolerance in the United States is that it establishes a culture of conformity that seems to constrain individual political liberty in many important ways.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\n“There is a strong suggestion of a close connection between how people think about their own freedom and what freedom they would grant to their political enemies, as well as some more inferential evidence of a linkage between cultural intolerance and perceived limits on political freedom.”\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow does intolerance in U.S. mass political culture influence politics?\n“It is worthwhile to consider other mechanisms through which mass political intolerance matters for politics.”\nDoes intolerance contribute to restrictions on freedom, self-censorship, and political conformity?\n\ndoes cultural intolerance inhibit freedom?\n\nHow strongly does the political culture of the United States encourage and reward conformity and discourage and penalize political nonconformity?\nTo what degree do tolerance and perceptions of political freedom go together? Do those who are intolerant perceive more limited freedom for themselves?\n\nthose who are more tolerant perceiving less political repression.\nthose who are more tolerant are also less likely to engage in self-censorship.\n\nTo what extent the intolerance of a spouse contributes to perceptions that freedom is best not exercised.\nTo what degree is intolerance of the community reflected in the intolerance of the individual respondent?\n\nis there an endogeneity issue here?\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nIntolerance matters for politics by constraining the freedom available to ordinary citizens.\nPeople learn from the political culture that intolerance is widespread, that it is acceptable, and that there are tangible risks to asserting views that the intolerant culture finds objectionable.\nI expect that more political freedom is perceived where these environments are more tolerant and that the environments are the most tolerant when they are the most diverse politically.\n\napproaching mutz/sorting.\n\nMass political intolerance creates a culture of conformity and that this culture significantly affects citizens’ perceptions of the freedom that is available to them.\nI hypothesize that greater exposure to political diversity is associated with greater political tolerance and with a greater sense of political freedom.\nI hypothesize that the political intolerance of a spouse has something to do with how one percieves political freedom.\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nmass political tolerance is not a prerequisite to democratic government.\n\nGibson is setting up the “so what?”\n\nif intolerant people still can exist under democracy, should we care?\n\n\nperceived political freedom - how people view the availability of liberty.\nThe elitist theory of democracy - this theory accepts as an empirical fact the intolerance of the mass public but argues that under most circumstances this intolerance is neutralized. Except under extraordinary political conditions, the antidemocratic mass public is immobilized by its own ignorance and apathy, leaving the relatively more democratic elite free to rule in a democratic fashion.\nwe shouldn’t just look at the influence of intolerance of on public policy but also on other matters of politics.\n“The political relevance of political intolerance, then, can be found in the constraints on political thought and action that citizens impose upon each other.\nGibson is basing tolerance off of environmental factors of the individual\n\nMacro: larger social and political community within which the respondent resides\nMicro: made up of the specific friendship and family groups relevant for the respondent.\n\nTolerance - opposition to state actions that limit opportunities for citizens, individual or in groups, to compete for political power.\nLittle support for full civil liberties for unpopular political minorities.\nperceived freedom!\n\nsurvey question of how free do you think you are?\n\nTo understand perception of personal political freedom we need to be sensitive to constraints emanating from the larger political system as well as from the personal network of the individual.\nBlacks are much more likely to perceive constraints on their freedom than are whites.\nLarge portions of the population are fearful of public expression of unpopular political views.\nTolerance of others is associated with the belief that there are few significant costs to be paid for one’s own political self-expression.\none of the most important attributes of the micro environments of individuals is diversity.\n\nas one is exposed to a greater range of political ideas, one can be come aware that alternative viewpoints are possible and legitimate and that one’s own view may not be absolutely correct\n\nVery Mutz/Big Sort stuff.\n\nkinda reminding me of the paper i wrote for Josh in core.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nWhen political discussion is common within the peer group and the peer group is composed of members with differing party identifications, blacks become significantly less likely to engage in behavioral self-censorship or to perceive governmental constraints on their freedom.\na large portion of Americans perceive little political freedom\nthere are considerable racial differences in perceived freedom\nPeer group diversity thus. contributes to greater perceived freedom\n\nremember this is from a name generator of close individuals.\n\npeer groups!\n\n\nMen with less tolerant wives tend to have fewer and less open political discussions at home, but their overall levels of perceived freedom are little affected.\nNow we need to figure out community level intolerance. this is hard.\namong both blacks and whites, those living in more tolerant communities are considerably more likely to perceive political freedom.\n“More important are the findings connecting perceptions of freedom and intolerance. Not only are those who are intolerant more likely to perceive constraints on their own freedom, but I have also adduced evidence that intolerance in the external environment contributes to a lack of perceived freedom. More homogeneous (and presumably less tolerant) peer groups, less tolerant spouses, and less tolerant local communities all seem to limit how much freedom ordinary Americans perceive. One reason why perceived freedom is so low seems to be that intolerance is so pervasive within American political culture."

Two features of Obama were primarily responsible for triggering ethnocentrism in 2008: his race and his imagined Muslim faith. As such, we demonstrate that ethnocentrism was much more important in 2008 than in the four presidential elections immediately preceding 2008, and we show that it was much more important in the actual contest between Senator McCain and Senator Obama than in a hypothetical contest between Senator McCain and Senator Clinton.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nEthnocentrism can be activated by salient political events and people.\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat role did ethnocentrism play in the 2008 election?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nEthnocentrism was activated because of Obama’s race and religion.\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nEthnocentrism - a deep-seated psychological predisposition that partitions the world into in-groups and outgroups - into “us” and “them.”\n\nthis seems like an obvious “truth” - Tajfel(?) also Allport\nthe technical name for this view of things in which one’s own group is the center of everything.\n\nEthnocentrism is not racism\n\neth is broader.\n\nbut probably connected.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nfocus on white individuals\n\nblack support for Obama was nearly unanimous.\n\n+1 means super ethnocentric.\n0 means absence of ethnocentric.\n-1 means outgroups are seen as virtuous and in groups as utterly without virtue.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nparty id was the biggest factor in how people voted (obvious)\nwhites high on ethnocentrism were less likely to vote obama.\nIndependents were the most affected by ethnocentrism\n\nthis is interesting!\n\nethnocentrism leads to racism.\nehtnocentrism was a major factor in 2008 but not other pres elections."

    "text": "Mutz, Diana. 2023. “Free Speech in the Post-Floyd Era.” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.\n\nAbstract:\nUsing a measure designed to capture intolerance on both sides of the political spectrum, I find that opinions favoring the abridgement of free speech rights are overwhelmingly targeted at right-leaning groups, and racist groups in particular. Consistent with recent studies, Democrats are found to be less tolerant than Republicans of speech they dislike. However, contrary to existing findings, the same patterns of intolerance are present for both racist and nonracist target groups. Treating racist groups as an exception to the principle of free expression may have resulted in a spillover to intolerance of other disliked groups.\n\n\nBumper Sticker\nDemocrats don’t like racist groups\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nAs of the 2020s, having a college education will negatively predict tolerance of racist groups but positively predict tolerance of nonracist groups\nyounger age will negatively predict tolerance of racist groups but positively predict tolereance of nonracist groups\nliberals/Democrats will persist in being more tolerant than conservatives/Republicans of speech by nonracist groups, but liberals/Democrats will be less tolerant than Republicans of free expression from racist groups.\nDemocrats will be less tolerant of right-leaning groups than independents, and that, relative to Independents, Republicans will be less tolerant of left-leaning groups - even though respondents of both parties will choose their most disliked gorup.\ntolerance of right leaning groups and right leaning groups that exclude racists will be fundamentally different, with Democratic party identification more positively predicting tolerance of non-racist, right leaning groups than right-leaning groups that include racists.\nDemocratic partisanship will more positively predict tolerance of nonracist, right-leaning groups tahn Republican partisanship will predict support for left-leaning groups.\nWith respect to education, the realignment hypothesis suggests that a college education should predict tolerance, but only if the target groups are not racist, since racist speech was suggested to be an exception to the greater tolerance expected of the well-educated.\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nMeasurement of political tolerance\n\nGSS\n\nthe loss of communism as a threat is interesting.\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\npanel data\n4 waves\nn at each wave = 2891, 2601, 2952, 4124.\nUse party identification rather ideological identification\n2020-2022\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Choice of Least-Liked Groups by Party Identification, October 2022\n\n\n\nTo summarize, intolerance is now driven primarily by partisans, younger people, and those without college degrees.\nRepublicans tend to be more tolerant of racist speech and less tolerant of speech from leftist groups, as one might expect.

    "text": "Pietryka, M, L. Santoro, and A.E. Sokhey. Working Paper (to be distributed).\n\nAbstract:\nPeople are more tolerant when they encounter political disagreement in their social networks. However, research supporting this claim predates concerns over polarization and democratic backsliding—it does not consider partisan tolerance and focuses on interactions with close friends and family (core networks). We develop theory linking acquaintance networks to tolerance, and evaluate it using Cooperative Election Study modules. We contribute by: 1) measuring partisan tolerance, 2) assessing the relationship between partisan tolerance and the presence of (co-)opposing partisans in acquaintance networks, 3) comparing acquaintance and core network approaches, and 4) examining tolerance relationships under important conditions. We find that exposure to outpartisans predicts affirming the civil liberties of outpartisans. Notably, acquaintance results mirror established findings based on core networks, and relationships hold when individuals dislike or feel threatened by outpartisans. Our results suggest that cross-partisan exposure need not be intimate or extended to be democratically meaningful.\n\n\nQuestion/motivation\n\nAt this point we simply do not know whether casual exposure to disagreement via acquaintances operates similarly to (or differently from) sustained interactions experienced in core networks.\n\nInstead of looking solely at individuals’ exchanges with their stronger (“core”) ties a la past efforts, we broaden the focus to whether exposure via more casual interpersonal interaction also has the potential to strengthen democratic functioning\n\nIf political disagreement among close contacts is beneficial but all too rare (given structural constraints and processes of selection/avoidance), casual exposure to political disagreement may be a remedy that is further-reaching and harder for people to circumvent.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nexposure to outpartisans should predict higher levels of political tolerance for opposing partisans, while exposure to inpartisans should drive in the opposite direction\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory\n\nMutz is largely seen as correct in cross-cutting relationships.\nbenefits if interpersonal connections was being discussed at the same time as the debate over the masses polarization.\nBut while other efforts have considered a left-right range of groups and looked at how the granting of tolerance varies by partisanship we prioritize the outcome of partisan tolerance, asking respondents about protecting the freedoms of outpartisans.\n\nrecall mutz just used democratic/republican allegiance\n\nGibson (1992) concluded that Americans in “less heterogeneous” networks were less politically tolerant.\nThus, while standard name generators yield valuable information, their practical limitations mean information is necessarily “right-censored”—after all, many people have more than 3-5 people with whom they talk politics or important matters\n\nWhile name generators regularly underestimate the size of individuals’ core networks, a more serious issue is that by design they also miss people’s casual exposures to political difference; they do not capture the contacts that might be “less relationally close and less frequent discussion partners”\n\nname generators are not weak ties.\n\nright?\n\n\n\nWhy should we expect interpersonal political disagreement to foster political tolerance in the first place?\n\nWith respect to more affective components, intimate relationships across lines of political difference—like those found in the “strong ties” of core networks—may help individuals develop affinity for members of outgroups, thereby leading to increased tolerance of said outgroups.\nthe idea is that interpersonal interactions across lines of difference can help individuals develop an awareness, understanding, and acknowledgment of societal group differences in opinion\nmay even help individuals differentiate stronger from weaker arguments in the context of such changes\n\nMutz notes that this side of the story emphasizes people’s relationships and feelings more than any type of idealized political debate: “It is not important that they learn about the rationales for one another’s political views, but it is important that they develop close relationships with those they know to hold quite different political viewpoints” (2006:68).\n\nis it the cognitive or affective path?\n\nwe don’t know and neither does Anand it seems.\n\n\nName generators are not the best.\nthe role of threat in tolerance.\n\n\n\nData/Design\n\nCES data. 2018\nomit independents.\n\n\n\nIndependent Variable:\n\nAcquaintance Network\n\nimagine someone you might chat for a second if you ran into them\nhow many of them do you think you can guess their party affiliation/who they voted for. They separate the amount of Clinton and Trump.\n\nits a count for Clinton and count for Trump\n\nthese numbers represent the amount of in group and out-group people they know.\n\nAccording to these measures, an estimated 42% of the population knew ten or more inpartisans, while 13% knew ten or more outpartisans. By comparison, 8% knew no fellow inpartisans, and 27% knew no outpartisans.\n\nthis is a cool measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting IV: Core Network\n\nThe battery asked, “Looking back over the last six months - who are the people with whom you discussed matters important to you?\n\nup to 5 individuals\n\nthen asked follow up questions.\n\nwhat if they don’t name any - is this because they are lazy or are the politically isolated? this was something Josh brought up to me last semester.\nBased on these measures, an estimated 24% of people identified four or five inpartisans in their core network, but only 4% identified four or five outpartisans in their core network. And, 23% of people identified no fellow inpartisans in their core network, while 72% of people identified no outpartisans in their core network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent Variable:\n\nExtension of Civil Liberties to Outpartisans\n\n“To what extent do you agree with the following statements about [outparty]?,” where the label for the outparty was “Democrats” for Republican respondents, and “Republicans” for Democratic respondents\n\n-   1\\. \\[Outparty\\] should be allowed to hold a large rally in my community.\n\n-   2\\. \\[Outparty\\] should be allowed to host a show on my local community access channel\n\n-   3\\. \\[Outparty\\] should be allowed to make a speech in my community.\n\n    -   Each item included a five-point scale with the following response options: Strongly agree; Agree; Neither agree nor disagree; Disagree; Strongly disagree.\n\n\n\nSecondary DV:\n1. [Outparty] are threatening to the American way of life. 2. [Outparty] are a threat to other people’s freedom. 3. [Outparty] are a threat through their influence on the young. 4. [Outparty] are threatening to me personally. 5. I don’t have much in common with most people who identify as [Outparty]. (reverse scored)\n\ncombine to form outparty threat.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nPeople whose core networks (first panel) or acquaintance networks (third panel) have more inparty voters tend to feel more threatened by the outparty.\npeople exposed to more co-partisan acquaintances tend to be more willing to extend liberties to members of the opposing party, despite also feeling greater threat from these outpartisans.\nAmericans’ exposure to the inpartisans and outpartisans in their core social networks still operates in expected (and democratically beneficial) ways."

This study argues OFR could return to white partisanship following decades of dormancy because of Obama’s presidency. After first demonstrating that such attitudes were significantly stronger predictors of opposition to Obama than ideologically similar white Democrats, I support that spillover hypothesis with the following evidence: opposition to interracial dating was correlated with white partisanship in 2009 despite being unrelated to party identification in 12 earlier surveys; moreover, evaluations of Obama completely mediated that relationship between OFR and partisanship; old-fashioned racism predicted changes in white panelists’ partisanship between 2006 and 2011; these attitudes were also a stronger determinant of midterm vote preferences in 2010 than they were in 2006, with that relationship once again mediated by President Obama; and experimentally connecting Obama to congressional candidates significantly increased the relationship between OFR and 2010 preferences."

    "text": "Ostrom, Vincent. 1999. The Meaning of American Federalism. ICS Press. Selected chapters\n\nChapter One: The Meaning of American Federalism\n\nDemocracy implies that people govern.\n\nthe “government” is not the people.\n\nVoting is not enough for democracy.\n\nDemocracy requires more than voting in elections.\n\nfederalism is the “more”.\n\n\n\n\nLanguage and Meaning in Political Discourse:\n\nThe constitution only references one element of federalism - a limited national government - in a more general system of governance.\nHamilton reformulates a confederation.\n\nArticles of Confed fail. Hamilton argues individuals are the basic elements.\nOstrom thinks Hamilton’s reformulation of the concept of confederation is an essential attribute of a federal system of government.\n\nHamilton’s conception:\n\neach unit of government must be able to articulate the aspirations of people, respond to the demands of individuals, and enforce its resolutions with regard to individuals, not to collectivities as such. Each unit would be autonomous in itself and have both executive and judicial authorities to enforce its resolutions as laws.\n\n\n\nStill ambiguity in the meaning of federalism. What shape does it have?\nAll federal systems have reference to multiple units of government, each of which has an autonomous existence.\nFederalism is generally between state and fed gov BUT states also practice federalism through incorporation of municipalities.\nHow people think and relate to one another is a most fundamental feature in the governance of human affairs.\nthis is reminding me a bit of Imagined Communities.\nReally focused on this concept of: how people relate and think with one another.\n\n\n\nTocqueville’s Analysis of the American Experiment\n\nTocqueville considers three types of factors to be important in understanding how a society functions.\n\nOstrom agrees!\n\nTocqueville concludes these three factors causes which tend to maintain democracy in America.\n\nfirst: “the peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence” places people.\n\nOstrom considers this to refer to the environmental and material conditions that are available to people in fashioning their lives.\n\nsecond: “the laws”\n\nOstrom considers this to refer to institutions - the working rules of going concerns.\n\nthird: the “manners and customs of the people.”\n\n“Habits of the heart” and to “the mass of those ideas which shape their character of mind”\n\nOstrom considers those to mean the manners and customs to include habits of thought - cognition.\n\n\n\nThrough these three points, we can understand the relationship of federalism to democracy.\nOstrom focuses on Tocqueville’s statement about how government operating is kinda invisible. Tocqueville is taken aback by this because the french government administration is visible in maintaing the tutelage over French society.\n\n\n\nSome Contemporary Reflections\n\nFederalism can be characterized as “constitutional choice reiterated to apply to many different units of government where each is bound by enforceable rules of constitutional law.”\npolicies emerge from the interaction of multiple centers of authority than to presume that they are made by some single center of ultimate authority.\n\nValid policies emerge from diverse processes of due deliberation.\n\nCollective actions, as distinguished from collective decisions, depend upon what people do in responding to the opportunities and exigencies of life.\n\nIf there is a shared community of understanding and a reasonable level of consensus about how to address common problems, people will exercise a significant influence in monitoring, facilitating, and constraining one another behavior rather than presuming that it is only governments that govern.\n\n\n\nGovernment in a democratic society, then, is not simply a matter of command and control but of providing multiple structures that have reference to diverse methods of problem solving!!!!!!! p.17\n\nTogether these methods enable people to process conflict in peaceful and constructive ways and to search out more effective ways of achieving resolutions.\n\nPeople have diverse interests but they work out effective complementarities of interest to achieve interdependent communities of interest. Processes of contention and adjustment occur as though an invisible hand were at work, rather than a visible hand exercising command and control over a society.\n\n\nThe constitution of order in a self-governing society turns upon how those configurations of relationships get put together.\n\n\n\nThe Scope of This Inquiry:\n\n“My concern is with how American federalism can be conceptualized as a regime that enables people to be first their own governors; to exercise substantial latitude in associating with others; to share in the exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial prerogatives; and to exercise the basic prerogatives of constitutional choice in setting, maintaining, and altering the terms and conditions of governance.”\n\nprimary attention is given to the way that the structures serve to process conflict and achieve conflict resolution.\n\nProcess is the key!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Conceptualizing The Meaning of American Federalism: Hobbeses Leviathan and The Logic of American Federalism:\n\nHumans create their social realities.\n\nhow they do so can take different forms\n\nWe need to think about through that.\n\nuses architecture as a metaphor\n\nHobbes argues that a unity of power is the only way to create a stable commonwealth.\n\nLocke challenges Hobbes with separation of powers\n\nMontesquieu proposes confederation.\n\nHamilton and Madison address the failures of confederation\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbes’s Leviathan\n\nProvides the computational logic for a unitary system of government.\nSix sets of computation in Hobbes’s analysis:\n\nThe initial statement of his methodological presuppositions\nhis exposition of the computations that are characteristic of human choice\nhis analysis of man in a “state of nature”\n\nno law, authority, no mine. Everyone is free to take what one can get and defend what one has got.\nconditions of scarcity are to prevail\n\nconflict will occur and in the absence of political constraint, will escalate to a point where people end up fighting with one another.\n\nOstrom contends Hobbes is flawed because it neglects the fact that humans have speech and could reason a way out. Hobbes however kinda makes this point later on.\n\nhis formulation of the articles of peace that lay the foundations for human community\n\nOstrom contends that words alone are not sufficient to maintain this.\n\nneed to be self-enforcing. To which Hobbes’s are not.\nHobbes main point revolves around the Golden Rule\n\n\nHis theory of sovereignty (that is, his Leviathan)\nhis specification of a sovereign’s accountability to God and the natural punishments that follow from errors of judgement.\n\nFor Hobbes: Humans continually strive to use present means to achieve some future apparent good that unfolds in a succession, one activity after another, that ceases only in death.\n\n…All human beings have a capacity to think for themselves, and their choices will reflect their own computation of the alternatives they consider to be available.\n\nPeople are never perfectly obedient automata; they always strive to better themselves. This is the source of all political contingencies.\n\n\nThe unity of the commonwealth depends upon a unity of power.\n\nA unity of power entails a monopoly over the powers of governance, including the powers of the sword, that are necessary to the maintenance and enforcement of rules of law and the defense of a common wealth.\n\n\n\n\nDemocracy, Constitutional Rule, And Federalism\n\nHobbes’s characterization of democracies as rule by assemblies of all citizens who will come together neglects a crucial consideration: in order to have rule by assemblies, it is logically necessary to have a shared community of understanding and agreement about the rules of assembly and what it means to govern by assembly.\nGovernment by assembly, then, necessarily depends upon generally accepted rules of assembly.\n\nHobbes presumes that it is the unity of the representer, not the unity of the represented, that makes the commonwealth one.\n\nThe representer and represented don’t always map onto each other very well.\nNeed established rules for assembly\n\nvest these powers into one person and its very dangerous.\n\nthat person can become the sovereign\n\n\nAll assemblies have oligarchical tendencies\n\nMadison federalist 55 and 58.\n\nmore coherent debate occurs in smaller assemblies.\n\noligarchical refers not to the contemporary version of oligarchical\n\nwe mean the traditional def of oligarchical not the wealthy billionaires.\n\nA democracy survives only so long as the rule of assembly is maintained with effective limits upon those who exercise leadership prerogatives and serve as agents of the assembly.\n\nMontesquieu: “If a republic be small, it is destroyed by foreign force; if it be large, it is ruined by internal imperfection”.\n\nMontesquieu thought confederation would this problem.\n\nsmall republics join together to defend against foreign aggression.\n\nmanifests in the Articles of Confederation.\n\nThis of course is a failure that is discussed later.\n\n\n\n\nHamilton argues: a confederate assembly is not sufficient in enforcing laws.\n\nA confederate assembly cannot enforce its resolutions as binding rules.\nindividuals are the fundamental unit.\n\nHamilton and Montesquieu describe compound republics.\nGeneral theory of limited constitutions: limits to the prerogatives of each unit of government are to be maintained by reference to a general system of constitutional law.\n\nEach unit of government is subject to the terms and conditions as specified in a constitution that serves a legal charter specifying the way that authority is distributed and shared in that unit.\nIf power is to be distributed and shared on the basis of opposite and rival interests, then all persons can have access to some powers of government and no one need be in a position to exercise unlimited power.\n\nArchitecture of constitutional arrangements:\n\nseparation of powers.\nchecks and balances\nties that link the exercise of authority by citizens to the exercise of authority in governmental decision structures. - Elections\n\nindividuals as citizens can share in the prerogative of rulership, whole both citizens and officials are subject to the rule of law.\n\n\n\nSome Conclusions:\n\nHobbes presumed that “it is the unity of the representer, not the unity of the represented” that gives unity to a commonwealth.\nDemocracies become tractable when people can learn from one another’s experience, and learn to diagnose problems of institutional weakness and institutional failure.\nInstitutions will fail. Thus institutional arrangement is not fully sufficient.\n\nthey must be accompanied by habits of the heart and mind that encourage the use of problem-solving.\n\np.51 he basically says exactly what is happening now and that stalemate and how “one’s neighbors become one’s enemies.” can still occur.\n\nhowever, he doesn’t really elaborate on it. He kinda does later:\n\n“But such arrangements are only workable in a society where people achieve a level of learning, experience, and skill that can best be characterized as a problem-solving culture. In such circumstances, people learn to address one another as colleagues capable of inquiring about puzzles, difficulties, and conflicts under the assumption that communication and enlightenment can enable human beings to avoid the perversities whereby some oppress and exploit others.”\n\n\nShades of Putnam implicitly mentioned in here to prevent collapse of democracy in the event institutions fail and one side attempts to usurp power and bring things to a stalemate.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: The Conventional Basis of American Federalism: Religious Roots\n\nAn Affinity Between Religion and Public Opinion\n\nTocqueville referred to religion as “the first of their political institutions”.\n\neven though it took no direct part in their society.\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Idea\n\nThe constitution of order in American society is grounded in the concept of covenanting with one another in the presence of God to constitute a civil body politic, and in a commitment to one another to act in accordance with such a concept in confronting future exigencies.\nThe core concept in American federalism is to rely upon processes of covenanting and combining ourselves together to form self-governing communities of relationships. These relationships began in the townships of New England…\nPilgrim Code of Law of 1636 - first modern constitution.\n\n\n\nPresuppositions\n\nThe presupposition that all men are created equal is grounded in the biblical tradition that human beings stand in a position of fundamental equality before their Creator.\n\n\n\nGod’s Law As A Method of Normative Inquiry\n\nThe Golden Rule, as a basic moral precept, is surprisingly devoid of moral content. Instead of a rule, it can better be conceived as a method of normative inquiry that enables human beings to come to a commonly shared understanding about the meaning of value terms used as norms or criteria of choice.\nThe Golden Rule is used as a conceptual scale—a cognitive device-for making interpersonal comparisons so that human beings can arrive at a common understanding of what is meant by standards of moral judgment and criteria for directing moral action.\n\n\n\nThe Struggle to Understand\n\nhuman beings are fallible\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAmerican federalism as a great experiment cannot be understood without reference to the metaphysical presuppositions that shape the hearts and minds of a people with two commitments: to a method of normative inquiry inherent in the Golden Rule; and to the struggle that fallible creatures share in coming to terms with misconceptions and misunderstandings.\nConflict provides an opportunity to elucidate information, extend horizons of inquiry, and achieve a level of common understanding consistent with a universe grounded in a coherent system of order in which unity can be achieved through diversity.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4: The Meaning of Federalism in The Federalist\n\nThe authors of The Federalist applied the term “federal” (foederal) to both the government under the Articles of Confederation and to the one proposed in the new Constitution.\n\n\nDiamond’s Argument\n\nFor Diamond, then, federalism implies a division of supreme authority between member states and a central government.\nA federal system combines states which confederally retain sovereignty within a certain sphere, with a central body that nationally possesses sovereignty within another sphere;\n\n\n\nThe Argument in Essay 9 of The Federalist: Barrier to Faction and Insurrection\n\nmore reps = more oligarch - Madison\n“Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates; every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob”\nSovereignty, conceptualized as the authority to make laws, is divided so that the people of the member republics are subordinate to the authority of the Union with respect to national affairs, but are independent with respect to those governmental prerogatives that apply to the jurisdiction of the separate states or republics. The states, in turn, serve as constituent parts of the national government by their representation in the Senate. Governments do not govern governments as such. Concurrent governments reach to the persons of individuals, including citizens and officials claiming to exercise governmental prerogatives under constitutional authority. These, I assume, are the true defining characteristics of what Madison refers to as a “proper federal system” in essay 51 of The Federalist.\nTocqueville argues “sovereignty may be defined to be the right of making law.”\nIf we draw upon these distinctions, constitutions might be viewed as fundamental laws establishing the terms and conditions of government, and the enactments of governments as ordinary laws. Supreme authority is exercised by the people as they set the terms and conditions of fundamental law by covenanting and combining themselves together into civil bodies politic. It is not governments that are supreme; what is supreme is the constitutional authority of people to establish and alter the terms and conditions of government.\nGovernments as such are not supreme. They are subject to fundamental law as formulated in constitutions and alterable by the people engaged in processes of constitutional choice.\nA federal republic includes multiple overlapping units of government that act with reference to individuals rather than governments as such.\nThe great teaching of The Federalist, to paraphrase Diamond, is that federalism is the better way of organizing “popular systems of civil government”\n\n\n\nThe Argument in Essay 39 of The Federalist: Using the Language of the Opposition\n\nWe might infer, then, that the concurrent exercise of authority by a limited national government and by states exercising a limited “sovereignty” (i.e., authority to make laws) represents an essential characteristic of a “proper federal system.\n\n\n\nThe Argument In Essays 15 and 16 of The Federalist: Conceptual Clarification\n\nA federal arrangement implies multiple units of government having concurrent jurisdiction. The national government is one of limited jurisdiction but with general competence to govern within that jurisdiction. The states also exercise a limited jurisdiction, with general competence to govern within that jurisdiction. In turn, each set of governments is governed by principles of constitutional law.\nThe conceptual innovation being introduced in the design of a federal system of government is the concurrent operation of a system of compound republics, each of which reaches to persons and citizens. Citizens function collectively, taking decisions of a constitutional nature in establishing the terms and conditions of government; and individually, in exercising the basic prerogatives of persons possessing constitutional rights that are correlated with limits upon governmental authority. This change in conceptualizing the place of individuals in concurrent republics altered the basic fabric in the design of American federal systems of government.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nLimits on jurisdiction to individuals are specified by reference to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution and various state constitutions.\nDiamond is thus correct in saying that the authors of The Federalist use the terms “confederation” and “federal” roughly as synonyms.\nWhere interests are arrayed against interests, there must exist processes for articulating contending interests and reaching decisions with regard to matters under contention. These are prerogatives to be exercised by people in the choice of elected officials and in making decisions of a constitutional nature. The way that people exercise their prerogatives in using a constitutional system of government will determine whether the limits of constitutional law are effectively maintained.\nAll of this kinda hinges on “enlightened citizenship”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Garcia, The Eclipse of Federalism, And The Central-Government Trap\n\nGarcia v. San Antonio Authority\n\nBefore 1976, the San Antonio Authority paid its employees in accordance with the federal fair labor standard act.\n\nIn 1976, SAA stopped paying employees in accordance with the FLSA. They changed because of the Court’s opinion in National League of Cities v. Usery.\n\nIn National League of Cities, the court held the tenth amendment, Congress can’t regulate wages of state employees in traditional government function.\n\nRecall the tenth amendment: Any powers not give to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people.\n\n\n\nSAA argument was that the FLSA did not apply to the SAA because it was an instrument of the state.\nHowever, the SC argued the FLSA did apply to the transit authority.\nCase seems to hinge on interpretation of the Commerce Clause.\nGarcia appears to abandon constitutional jurisdiction with reference to the substantive powers of the national government.\nBlackmun doctrine argues that there is no criterion that could be used to place discrete limits upon the scope of federal authority.\n\nOstrom does not like this! because it means words don’t matter.\n\nOstrom’s big issue: Because Garcia was ruled to give congress power to regulate whatever affects or is affected by interstate commerce, the power of Congress is much more sweeping than before. This is a major power grab for the federal government because it extends their power to all aspects of American society.\n\n\n\nThe Blackmun Doctrine and Madison’s Conjecture in Essay 39 of The Federalist\n\nBlackmun asserted that the framers of the U.S. Constitution chose to rely upon a federal system designed so that the restraints on national powers over the states would turn principally upon the workings of the national government.\n\n\n\nElectoral Arrangements, Modes of Representation, and Collective Decisions\n\n“Blackmun confuses federal form with the eclipse of federalism.”\n\n\n\nThe Structure of Government and the Rule of Law\n\nThe operation of distinguishable processes of law making and law adjudicating apart from law enforcing means that standards can be created that are publicly knowable, and allow for the performance of officials to be subject to a public assessment by citizens who have access to legal and judicial processes.\nThe general theory of limited constitutions, as applied in the American system of governance, presumes that residual authority resides in the constitutional authority of the people in each state to establish the terms and conditions of government that apply to each state and to the system of governance within each state. The U.S. Constitution was conceived not as a general and full grant of governmental (plenary) authority but as one that is subject to an explicit delegation of limited authority.\nThe Blackmun doctrine takes the position that the substantive grants of powers (that is, what is authorized) cannot be limited except where prohibitions (what is forbidden) are stated explicitly.\n\n\n\nThe Central-Government Trap\n\nBlackmun doctrine abandons the limits inherent in a general theory of limited constitutions.\nMore power is being transferred to the executive.\n\nOstrom doesn’t really seem to discuss why that is.\n\nFour types of political transformation:\n\nincreasing centralization of authority in the national government\nincreasing erosion of legislative standards\nincreasing centralization of executive authority\nincreasing arbitrariness in the exercise of judicial authority\n\nCome back to this section - he talks about how all of this gives way to moral crusades.\n\n\n\nThe Limits of “Federal Form”"

    "text": "Robertson, David Brian. 2012. Federalism and the Making of America. Routledge.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\n\nFederalism: is a long-lasting institutional arrangement of political power in which both a national government and regional governments within a nation each have separate authority to maintain order, make laws, tax citizens’ incomes, purchases and property, and provide public services.\nAncient Greece was a confederacy.\nFederalism differs from other federal systems by:\n\n1) bringing smaller units of government together\n\nthis differs from other countries which use federalism to to help hold together politics with deep ethnic or cultural divisions in different geographical areas.\n\n2) In all other federal systems, the national government deliberately equalizes regional resources by redistributing more financial aid to the poorest regions.\n\nThe united states does not do this.\n\n3) American federalism is much more elastic than other nations.\n\nStates compete with each other.\n\nDelaware as an example\n\nnot sure how I feel about this.\n\ndoesn’t this create a form of cut-throat competition?\n\nif states compete for businesses and continually lower taxes, it might approach zero and thus leave the government without corporate tax revenue? ask Ken his thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nFederalism affects who gets what, where, when, and how.\nFederalism influences the following in different ways:\n\nFreedoms and Rights\n\nFederalism has a mixed record of protecting individual rights\nif something is a right-whether to be free of environmental rules or to marry a gay partner-government should protect the right for all Americans, not just those who happen to live in some of the states.\n\nDemocracy\n\nfederalism allows citizens to better control and even resist the national government,\nMadison: “the first and most natural attachment of the people will be to the governments of their respective States”\n\nI find this somewhat suspect in modern times. Attachment to the states seem much more obvious as they existed in a time prior to the formation of the United States. That national culture had not existed yet.\n\nwonder what this means for the nationalization of politics.\n\nAsk Ken.\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency:\n\nbasically federalism gives greater flexibility to address niche problems that can’t be solved with an overarching law.\n\nInnovation:\n\nfederalism “enables a people to try experiments which could not safely be tried in a large centralized country.”\nSC Justice Louis Brandeis, “a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”\nLaboratories of Democracy.\n\nProsperity:\n\nBarry Weingast contended that the federal system is “market-preserving”, that is, it encouraged capitalist growth because the states have the ability and the will to compete with one another to foster their own internal prosperity. In doing so, they have a strong incentive to keep American economic regulations and taxes within limits that do not discourage investment and business expansion.\n\nsee my point about Delaware.\n\nMight this foster a form of cut-throat competition.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: “I argue that federalism plays an essential role as a battleground for all important American political conflicts\n\nduh.\n\nBoth parties have used federalism as either a weapon or a shield.\nFederalism endures because it is path dependent.\n\na tendency for an established way of doing things to become self-reinforcing for most people\n\nI wonder what Americans think about federalism today.\n\nI ask because it seems most Americans are fed up with the slowness of government and seem to want government to be more efficient and thus more likely to support a centralization of power? just a thought idk.\n\n\n\nStrategies for change and Federalism:\n\nconstitutional amendments, congressional laws, federal court rulings.\nthe concept of layering\n\na tactic of placing new responsibilities on the states to produced desired outcomes, usually in return for a conditional grant of money or some other benefit.\n\nThird, reformers who confront obstacles at the state level sometimes try to bypass existing state government and political institutions by energizing new institutions that are more likely to produce the outcomes they seek.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Federalism at the Founding\n\nHow much central power?\n\nthis question motivates the founding fathers and pretty much all discussion of federalism.\n\nConstitution left an ambiguous boundary between national and state power that has produced endless fights over federalism.\nStates for many reasons had different interests.\n\nSlaves were a big part of those diverging interests.\n\nGeorgia and SC demanded more slaves and the continuation of the trade, but Virginia and NC already had plenty and were more supportive of banning slave imports.\n\nStates seemed to benefit themselves at the expense of others\n\nShays Rebellion.\nthe pursuit of narrow self-interest was making “the situation of this great Country weak, inefficient and disgraceful\n\nGeorge Washington said that.\n\n\n\nMadison & Hamilton\n\nbelieved states should have a minor role\nMadison believed that the states; autonomy, power, and selfish parochialism were the basic flaws in the Confederation government.\nWanted Broad Nationalism\n\nVirginia plan.\n\n\nNarrow Nationalism\n\nRoger Sherman of Connecticut was the big name here.\nAdvocated of narrow nationalism\n\nwanted a stronger national government, but they wanted specific, narrow new powers rather than the broad authority Madison sought.\n\n\nBroad v. Narrow showdown aka the convention\n\nTwo issues specifically divided the Convention:\n\nthe states representation in Congress\nthe extent of power required by the national government.\n\nAlso a debate about sovereignty.\n\nHamilton was basically like “nah, the national government can only have true sovereignty.”\nBut others were like “nah bro we can have shared sovereignty between the state and national government.”\n\nWe eventually get a compromise (The Connecticut plan) - Madison wasn’t there but Sherman was\n\n“The delegates, then, designed American federalism by compromising on a series of conflict about the specific powers of the national government. Narrow Nationalism prevailed in protections for state power to tax, maintain a militia, and the commercial power. Broad nationalism prevailed in new national taxing, military, and commercial authority, and in flexible powers that could be expanded in the future.\n\n\nSherman really wanted militas:\n\n“the states might want their militia for defense against invasions and insurrections, and for enforcing obedience to their laws.”\n\nlol this flies in the face of 2nd amendment modern interpretation.\n\n\nConstitution firmly established that it and the national laws “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.”\nConstitution gave the national government potentially broad authority to make all laws “necessary and proper” for executing all its enumerated powers.”\nConstitution reflected a vision of broad national government responsibility “to form a more perfect union, to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”\nConstitution needed some TLC to be ratified.\nTenth amendment was added.\n\ntenth provides no guidance about the precise boundary between state and national power.\n\nFederalist papers came into existence to argue for the constitution.\nFirst, The constitution allowed the states to keep the powers of everyday governing, control most of the policy tools for governing everyday American life - local and particular interests.\n\ndiversity lies at the heart of federalism.\nshort term interest was very powerful early on.\n\nSecond, the constitution authorized the national government to exercise the powers of national sovereignty, that is, the tools of diplomacy, commerce, and national security exercised by other sovereign national governments.\n\nstates, not the national gov, had and kept the power to govern their own culture, politics, and economy.\n\nThird, the ambiguous boundary between state and national power has encouraged political conflict throughout American history.\nFourth, the conflict between national and state turned American federalism into a massive arena of political conflict.\n\nthe first battleground - involves whether the government should act to deal with a public problem or not.\nthe second battleground - what LEVEL of government should have the power to choose whether to act.\n\nInteresting point by Woodrow Wilson:\n\n“…It cannot, indeed, be settled by the opinion of anyone one generation because it is a question of growth, and every successive stage of our political and economic development gives it a new aspect.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Federalism, Political Parties and Interests\n\nFederalism fules political polarization because it allows the political parties to take different states in divergent political directions.\nVoter identification laws illustrate this battle well.\n15th amendment says you cant restrict voting from certain people.\n\nstates got creative to prevent slaves from voting\n\n-   literacy, citizenship tests, poll taxes, grandfather clause.\nVoting Rights Act of 1965 outlaws all this stuff ^^^^\nmore recent stuff relates to voter ID laws.\n\nShelby v. Holder\n\nthe court effectively struck down a requirement from the 1960s that sates with a history of voter suppression get Federal approval before implementing new election laws like a photo identification requirement.\n\nstates got more emboldened to restrict voting.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Constitution Shaped Political Parties and Interest Groups\n\nFramers thought that legislators being from different regions and thus having different constituencies would have different interests from others. Implicitly implying parties would not form because of legislators unique constituents.\nMadison had observed coalitions before. And knew they could be dangerous if gained a majority\n\nhe presumed that federalism and the. separation of powers would fragment the government so thoroughly that these factions owuld find it hard to cooperate to achieve their selfish, destructive purposes.\n\nFederalism was a massive obstacle to national political cooperation.\n\nthis is an interesting point and I think is actually a major problem now.\nbring this up.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Political Parties and Interest Groups in the American Federal System\n\nPolitical parties - a durable coalition of individuals who seek and hold public offices\n\nthis differs from Zaller’s definition.\n\n“In part because of federalism, the United States failed to develop the coherent national political parties and strong, inclusive, and centralized business and labor organizations that shaped the political development of other wealthy democracies.”\n\nis he saying that the parties never crystallized around business v. labor?\n\nV.O. Key: “Perhaps the outstanding characteristic of American party organizations, viewed from the national aspect, is its decentralized nature.”\n\ninteresting. Is this true now?\n\nSeems to be an argument that federalism (decentralization) made parties harder to centralize into national party organizations like that of other countries.\nDecentralized American parties relied heavily on patronage to keep their national coalitions together.\n\n\n\nFederalism and the Development of the Democratic and Republican Parties\n\nFederalist (Jefferson & Madison) were opposed to Hamilton’s central bank.\n\n\n\nPolitical Polarization:\n\nMain Argument: Federalism has intensified political party polarization.\n\npolitical polarization has intensified the use of federalism as a partisan battleground.\n\nFederalism has intensified political polarization because partisan majorities who hold power in the states are actively using their powers to defeat their partisan opponents.\n\n\n\nAmerican Interest Groups:\n\n“A striking feature of American politics is the extent to which political parties are supplemented by private associations formed to influence public policy.”\nInterest groups strength was noted by Tocqueville.\nInterest groups were naturally strong at the state level because states controlled most of the everyday governing in the nation.\n“Because federalism helped fracture business interests, it weakened American businesses’ incentives to cooperate in building strong”peak” organizations that would advocate a broad, coherent, and clear program of business priorities for national action.” ’\nFederalism also fragmented organized labor.\nFederalism has fostered pluralism.\nFederalism has made nationwide political cooperation difficult by helping to decentralize and narrow political organization in the United States.\nFederalism is a means to an end.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Federalism and Race\n\nFederalism allowed the states to decide whether to encourage and expand slavery, or to abolish it.\nFederalism allowed the slave-holding states to prolong the exclusion of blacks for generations, long after abolition and the military defeat of the Southern slave states in the nineteenth century.\nFederalism has fragmented efforts to deal with the consequences of slavery, segregation, and white supremacy.\nNo feudalism in America -&gt; race and gender become the dominant, de facto, hierarchy.\nRace often marked the deepest polarizing issues in American politics. Poole & Rosenthal\nSlavery and the southern states that really fuels the debate about federalism and onwards after the convention.\n14th amendment comes out of the civil war.\n\nso is the 14th amendment in response to only former slaves?\n\nwhat did they think about other races…I guess it wasn’t an issue since they passed it.\n\n\nDespite considerable federal government actions to protect African-Americans (this is of course relative, there could have been more done).\n\nfederalism and the fragmentation of government made it impossible to ensure other branches of government and the states would adhere faithfully.\n\nWe get Jim Crow Laws.\nWoodrow Wilson was HELLLA racist.\nThe New Deal improves many African American lives.\n\nstill had considerable problems though with race.\nstill allowed state and local officials to discriminate against blacks and other minorities in many New Deal programs.\n\n\n\nThe Civil Rights Revolution\n\nNazism basically inspires many Americans to start reevaluating some stuff in America.\nStates started to diverge on racial policy.\n1964 Civil Rights Act\n\neliminated states’ p[power to segregate schools, public accommodations, and the workplace.\noutlawed discriminating in hiring, firing, training, or promoting employees because of their race, color, gender, or nationality, and established an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nEfforts to address past employment and college admissions discrimination resulted in affirmative action programs.\nin 1996, California voters approved Prop 209 which banned preferential treatment for “any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Federalism and American Capitalism\n\nIn a capitalist system, private owners, and not the government, own the key means of production (land and natural resources, capital, and labor) and these owners distribute products by exchanging them in free markets.\nEconomist Karl Polanyi argued that governments created free markets by actively extending property rights, enforcing business agreements, and breaking down barriers to buying and selling.\nPolanyi identified a double movement in capitalist development:\n\nconstant pressure for unfettered economic growth driven by capitalism\n\nin America, this kinda wins out.\nThe states competing for private enterprise made this more likely to win out.\n\nand constant pressure to relieve the problems that markets created for many people.\n\nEconomic development must be politically viable and efficient as well.\n“Federalism, then, had two effects on the management of American economic growth. First, it allowed those who opposed government efforts to restrict market expansion to dig in behind states’ rights and oppose the expansion of national power to mitigate the effects. Federalism in the United States tended to be”market-preserving”: it limited the ability of American public officials to restrict business and to redistribute wealth from those who profited from capitalism to others. But, second, the very fact that federalism encouraged the growth of strong private enterprises also encouraged a backlash that defined business as a hostile adversary that required strict policing and punishment.\nHamilton wanted national government to have greater control over econ.\nStates provided legal charters for corporations\n\nthis is important as states had different regulations and taxes\n\nthis is why everyone is chartered in Delaware.\n\n\nSanta Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company\n\nSC interpreted the 14th amendment as a guarantee of corporate rights (equating corporations with individuals) and limited state inferences with the freedom of corporations.\n\nPools become a thing\n\nlegal agreements to keep rates high.\n\nthis becomes a big thing with railroads.\n\n\nWabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company v. Illinois\n\nOnly congress can make regulations on interstate railroad rates not the states.\n\nInterstate Commerce Act in 1887\n\nneutralize the economic weapons that railroads had used to escape state control\nestablished the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)\n\nauthority to challenge the prices that interstate railroads set for freight.\nfurther made it impossible for railroads to cooperate in creating a cartel.\n\n\nSherman Antitrust Act of 1890\n\ndeclaring illegal “every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several state…”\n\nstates not the national government controlled corporate law.\n\nHowever, giant corporations could take refuge from antitrust law by simply incorporating in a single state.\n\nDemocrats were emboldened to use the federal government to more actively stabilize the capitalist system in the Great Depression.\nNational Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) - authorized businesses in each major industry to regulate their prices, production, and working conditions, and allowed the Federal government to enforce these agreements.\n\nSC ruled against the NIRA.\n\nSC argued fed was overstepping a power that was exclusively to the States.\nSchechter Poultry Company of New York.\n\n\nGlass-Steagall Act - required commercial and investment banks to separate, and prohibited commercial banks from underwriting most securities.\nSC eventually retreats from their earlier decision and upheld national power to regulate union organizing, even within a state.\nPollution regulation is interesting\n\ninitially led by the states. But there is still problems. As William D. Ruckelshaus, the first director of the U.S. EPA notes:\n\n“My impression in those days was the that pollution was essentially a problem caused by competition among the states for the location of industry within their borders. When we began to enforce pollution laws, they were pretty broad in modern terms and only addressed flagrant pollution. I mean, there were a lot of cities without any sewage treatment and there were industries discharging absolutely untreated material into the waterways, killing fish. But whenever we pushed a major company very hard, there was always the threat they would move to the south where the governors said, in effect,”Come on down here, we don’t care, we need your business, we need jobs.’ My impression was, if you simply centralized all of this oversight and enforcement activity, you could bring such states and governors in line because there wouldn’t be any place for them to run and hide.”\n\nreally good quote.\n\nfurther: the Automobile industry got annoyed by all the different state regulations and campaigned for a single federal law to supersede the patchwork of different state rules.\n\n\n\n\n1980s - businesses mobilized and helped conservative Republicans.\n\nThe Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 - repealed New Deal era banking law and preempted states from prohibiting any of the banking activities allowed by Federal Law.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6: Progressive Reform\n\nThe Progressive Impulse:\n\nthe progressive movement addressed ideas, interests, and issues stemming from the modernization of American society.\n\n\n\nThe Expansion of Government and Democracy:\n\nstate income tax exploded.\n\nmuch more compared to federal government.\n\nprogressive movement shifted power to executives and experts.\nTook power away from political parties and legislative bodies.\nRural bias still present in state legislature.\n\n\n\nState Policy Innovation and its Limits\n\nStates enacted a lot of innovative laws.\n\n\n\nLabor:\n\nAmerican labor protections spread unevenly and state labor regulations became increasingly different in different states.\nlabor was fragmented much more than in Europe.\nsmaller employers hated unions too.\n\n\n\nWomen:\n\nwomen could exert more strength simply because they were in every political jurisdiction.\nwomen used federalism skillfully to win the right to vote.\n\n\n\nProhibition\n\nprohibition used federalism to successfully lobby for prohibition.\nstate-by state strategy.\n\n\n\nUniform Laws:\n\nFederal spending power that provided an alternative way to motivate states across the nation to take action.\n\n\n\nLayering Reform: Federal Grants-in-Aid for Activating the States\n\nFederal grants- in-aid could put Federal revenue to work to bypass even moribund state governments in a specific field and establish a national fabric of specific state activities nourished by Federal money.\nUnder a grant-in-aid program, the Federal government would send money in the form of grants to the states on the condition that they establish a specific kind of public agency or program and match Federal funds with some of their own funds.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7: The New Deal:\n\nNew Deal established a federal minimum wage.\nFederal government required industries to include minimum wage rules in mandated codes of “fair competition”\n\nit became clear that interstate competition still made it almost impossible for states to implement a minimum wage individually. Thus we get the fed min wage.\n\n\n\nThe Great Depression and American Government\n\nAmerican cities’ revenues fell by forty percent in these years.\nstates made the job crisis worse by cutting spending on public works.\nto make up for lost revenue from property taxes, many states implemented income taxes.\n\n\n\nThe Transformation of Federalism\n\nHoover didn’t want to use the fed that much.\nFed gov never had more employees than the states,\nfed spending grew enormously.\n\n\n\nFederalism and New Deal Politics:\n\nSouthern Dems didn’t like new deal because it threatened a lot of their way of life.\nalso threatened agriculture and subordination of African Americans.\n\n\n\nThe Grants Strategy and the Rise of Intergovernmental Relations:\n\nEnthusiasm for national power began to erode.\ninstead of attacking state gov power, Roosevelt chose to build on the grants strategy to advance Federal and state activism.\nGrant-in-aid exploded.\nmost were categorical grants - they were Federal funds given for specific, narrowly defined purposes like highway construction or aid to mothers with dependent children.\n“Cooperative” federalism - the Federal government emerged as an active, senior partner of the states, funding government action on a wide range of issues.\n\n\n\nSocial Security\n\nRoosevelt emphasized state control over social security b/c of political issues if he didn’t.\nstates varied wildly\nRoosevelt refused to support health insurance.\n\nthey thought its inclusion would generate enough opposition to sink the whole plan.\n\nCongress in 1940 wanted a system of grants to the states to set up health insurance, the proposal died because of the opposition of a powerful coalition of interest groups, led by the American Medical Association and the U.S chamber of commerce.\nAlone among the provisions of the Social Security Act, the Federal government would directly manage old-age insurance for retired workers-the program now associated with the term, “Social Security”.\n\nEmployers and workers in long-term, full-time jobs would make mandatory contributions to a Federally run trust fund.\n\nWhy not let the states run this?\n\n1) “Congress can’t stand the pressure of the Townsend plan unless we have a real old-age insurance system…”\n2) no state had created a government sponsored old age insurance program, thus no state had innovated on this and no state would probably oppose as a result.\n3) Fed policymakers believed that nationally run social insurance for the elderly would cost less than Fed-state grants for old-age pensions.\n4) American workers frequently moved across state lines.\n5) program excluded domestic workers and agriculture workers, and for that reason, left much of the labor market in the South-particularly its racial composition-undisturbed.\n\n????????? wait what? Ask Ken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganized Labor:\n\nNew Deal helped organized labor.\nNational Labor Relations Act of 1935.\nTaft-Hartley Act of 1947 - passed by a Republican Congress over PResident Truman’s veto, allowed states to prohibit the union shop (that is, workplaces that require union membership as a condition of employment.\nright-to-work laws. Used to blunt the expansion of trade unions\n\nover half the states passed these,\n\n\n\n\nLegacy:\n\nNew deal had three high costs\n\n1) more fragmentation to public policy\n2) grants and contracts among governments established a new arena of political conflict, one that was almost invisible to the public.\n3) Federal policies delivered through states made many policies vulnerable to interstate rivalry and competition.\n\nreview this point and the evidence for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Liberal Activism and Intergovernmental Relations\n\nHealth Care From the New Deal to the Great Society to Obamacare\n\nlots of gaps in health insurance.\nalmost every president has tried to do something and they all fail.\nLyndon B Johnson pushes for:\n\nmedicare: provided social security retirees with hospital insurance\nmedicaid: a program of federal-state income assistance programs.\n\nmedicaid varies wildly from state to state.\n\n\nClinton pushed for another new grant-in-aid called the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.\n\nCHIP encouraged states to provide insurance coverage to children in families who lacked health insurance but whose income was too high for Medicaid eligibility.\n\nObama approved the expansion of this.\n\n\nAll of this created a lot of powerful political interests.\nFed tax code subsidized employer-provided health insurance by exempting these benefits from Federal taxes.\nObamacare was based on Romney’s plan.\n\nprovided for insurance exchanges in each state\nexpanded Medicaid\nrequired employers to provide insurance to employees, required individuals to obtain health insurance\nand prohibited insurance companies from dumping those who become sick or have long-term health problems.\n\nin 2017, states refused to expand medicaid\n\n28 states declined to establish insurance exchanges\n9 states adopted laws making compliance with obamacare a crime unless the state leg approved it.\n\n\n\n\nCreative Federalism\n\nCreative fed differed from the new deal\n\n1) addressed new priorities of the time.\n\nby Obama, healthcare grants were like 2/3 of all fed grants.\n\n2) fed grants bypassed state govs and went directly to other entities.\n3) fed imposed more regulations on grant recipients.\n\none type of regulation was the crosscutting requirement that mandated all those who received Federal grants had to obey a particular regulation, regardless of the purpose of the grant.\n\n4) with the major exception of Medicaid, most liberal grants were project grants\n\nproject grants required grant applications to propose a project to a federal agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant Activism and the Republicans\n\nNixon used block grants to redirect grants more broadly\n\na new federalism in which power, funds and responsibility will flow from Washington to the States and the people.\nwould group together several similar categorical grant programs, and turn over to the states the money and responsibility for this single block of formerly separate programs.\n\nthese block grants would shift money to the state level, and would allow the states much more control over how they would use this money.\n\nThe Community Development Block Grant of 1974 was one of these.\n\n\n\nNixon also did general revenue sharing\n\nstate/local could get money and spend it how they want.\n\nNixon increased grant spending but it also shifted grants-in-aid away from the Democrats’ central city constituency and toward the growing Republican constituency in suburban and rural areas and in sunbelt states.\nThe fed gov was writing checks the state and local governments and other organizations cashed and spent, particularly on the problems of health, poverty, and edu, and cities.\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nBefore 1950s, state and local gov controlled public edu with virtually no Federal influence\nbaby boom put more pressure for new schools and more teachers\nRussia launched sputnik and the USA was like “oh shit, we need more STEM”\n\nNational Defense Education Act of 1958\n\nFed gave money to states for them to centralize more STATE control over education.\nby 1980 the fed gov established the department of edu, further strengthening the link between the Fed government, NEA, and the state and local education establishment.\n\ni want a little more history of the department of edu.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental\n\ncities/states had different environmental policies\nneed to standardize these policies b/c of wide variance.\nFederal environmental regulations imposed limits on the states, but they also reinforced state authority because they allowed states to exercise new authority in implementing the law.=\n\n\nlegacy\n\ngot hard to manage all these grants.\nsome grants were not successful and struggled to be effective\nlocal responsibility also produced local abuses and mistakes, and unevenness across places and programs.\nthis caused bad PR and strengthened critics of the fed government.\nleading to a backlash against the liberal activism in the 1980s.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9: Federalism and Today’s Issues:\n\nConservatives say they like federalism but in practice have used both decentralization and centralized federal power to promote market-driven economic growth and traditional social values.\n\ndemocratic presidents have also used a mix of federalism.\n\n\n\nFederalism and Climate Change\n\nstates vary on their greenhouse emission standards.\nfederalism as a tool rather than as an end.\n\n\n\nThe Backlash against Liberalism and the Rise of Conservatism\n\nconservatives built think tanks to provide intellectual arguments for a free market and decentralized policy.\nrepublicans really start getting motivated and winning across the nation.\n\n\n\nFederalism and the Reagan Administration\n\nWhile other presidents since the New Deal had viewed the Federal and state governments as partners, the Reagan administration viewed them as competing sovereigns.\nFed tax cuts and domestic spending cuts would be aimed to cut the Fed’s ability to fund domestic programs, including all grants-in-aids.\n1986, fed ended general revenue sharing.\n\n\n\nHow Political Polarization has Enlarged the Battlefield of Federalism\n\npartisans used federalism as a shield and sword.\nConservatives and Republicans since 1980 have used federalism as a strategic weapon: they decentralize power when and if decentralization was likely to produce conservative results, but they expanded U.S. government power where state and local discretion would undercut their important priorities, such as reducing business regulation.\n\nThe Reagan administration gave the states more power to implement clean air laws, aware that many states would relax the enforcement of these regulations on businesses within the state.\n\nWhile Reagan’s speeches celebrated federalism, in reality the administration “encouraged additional centralization of political power in several functional areas and prohibited state economic regulation of certain industries.”\nRepublicans made disputes over policy, disputes over federalism.\n\ninteresting point.\n\nmore state activism during and post Reagan.\n\na return to the “laboratory of democracy.”\n\n\n\n\nFederalism in a polarized era\n\nClinton promised to “end welfare as we know it.”\nrepublican states refused to

threatened to cut federal aid to sanctuary cities.\n\n\n\nFederalism and the Making of America\n\nFederalism provides a battlefield for the struggle to win and keep political, economic, and social power.\nFederalism has had a cumulative impact on American politics, policy, and life.\nGovernment expansion since 1900 has been built on top of nineteenth-century federalism\n\n\nThe U.S. Constitution produced an unfinished framework for American federalism because they could not agree on the balance of national and state authority.\n\n\n\nFederalism as an Expedient Battlefield for Conservatives and Liberals\n\nFederalism endures because the states have always served the purposes of powerful political interests, and when it is selectively used, federalism often brings these interest positive returns on their political investments.\n\n\n\nConservatives\n\nsay they are for state rights but in reality are not.\nthey care only for their conservative goals.\nConservatives

    "text": "Freeder et al. 2019. “The Importance of Knowing”What Goes with What”: Reinterpreting the Evidence on Policy Attitude Stability.” Journal of Politics. 81(1).\n\nAbstract:\nWhat share of citizens hold meaningful views about public policy? Despite decades of scholarship, researchers have failed to reach a consensus. Researchers agree that policy opinions in surveys are unstable but disagree about whether that instability is real or just measurement error. In this article, we revisit this debate with a concept neglected in the literature: knowledge of which issue positions “go together” ideologically—or what Philip Converse called knowledge of “what goes with what.” Using surveys spanning decades in the United States and the United Kingdom, we find that individuals hold stable views primarily when they possess this knowledge and agree with their party. These results imply that observed opinion instability arises not primarily from measurement error but from instability in the opinions themselves. We find many US citizens lack knowledge of “what goes with what” and that only about 20%–40% hold stable views on many policy issues.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhat share of citizens hold meaningful views about public policy?\nWhat is the source of instability in survey measures of the public’s policy opinions?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe knowledge of what goes with what plays an important and under-appreciated role in attitude stability.\n\nWhen people learn what goes with what (which policy positions are Republican and which are Democratic), they will tend to exhibit stable policy views.\n\nThose who do not know elite positions should generally have less stable views, even when we measure their attitudes with multi-item scales.\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nDebate in lit about question\nZaller & Zaller & Feldman argued that opinion instability results from citizens holding conflicting considerations on policy issues and then sampling from these pools of inconsistent considerations when they answer survey questions.\nOthers argue (Achen) that people do hold meaningful opinions but is ambiguous due to measurement error.\nIf citizens lack meaningful views about even the most salient political issues, instead having their opinionsontheseissueseasilychangedbypoliticalelites and the media, “democratic theory loses its starting point” (Achen 1975, 1220).\nIn this article, we show that this long line of research has yielded mixed results because it has examined opinion stability by general political knowledge, a poor proxy for what we believe drives attitude stability.\n\nwhat goes with what\n\nPeople adopt the heuristics and follow the leaders\n\nvery top-down driven mechanism for attitude stability.\n\n\n\n\nData/Method:\n\n\nResults:\n\nWe find that a large segment of the public lacks knowledge of “what goes with what,” and consequently a large segment lacks stable policy views on salient issues. Relatedly, we find that those who do possess this knowledge tend to have stable views, but only when they agree with the views of their party."

    "text": "Ahler, Douglas J. 2014. “Self-Fulfilling Misperceptions of Public Polarization.” JOP 76:607-20\n\nAbstract:\nMass media convey deep divisions among citizens despite scant evidence for such ideological polarization. Do ordinary citizens perceive themselves to be more extreme and divided than they actually are? If so, what are the ramiﬁcations of such misperception? A representative sample from California provides evidence that voters from both sides of the state’s political divide perceive both their liberal and conservative peers’ positions as more extreme than they actually are, implying inaccurate beliefs about polarization. A second study again demonstrates this ﬁnding with an online sample and presents evidence that misperception of mass-level extremity can affect individuals’ own policy opinions. Experimental participants randomly assigned to learn the actual average policy-related predispositions of liberal and conservative Americans later report opinions that are 8–13% more moderate, on average. Thus, citizens appear to consider peers’ positions within public debate when forming their own opinions and adopt slightly more extreme positions as a consequence.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nPeople misperceive polarization and this influences their attitudes/beliefs.\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nDo ordinary citizens perceive themselves to be more extreme and divided than they actually are?\n\nthe difference between perception and actual is interesting. What does that mean?\n\nIf so, what are the ramifications of such misperceptions\n\nso there is a descriptive endeavor here and then the author asks the implications of the descriptive finding.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nMisperceived mass polarization. Citizens tend to overestimate the extremity of their peers’ political positions. More specifically, they overestimate the liberalism of self-described liberals and the conservatism of self-described conservatives.\n\ninitial thought: all people or the most idealistic? What type of person is overestimating.\n\nperhaps if it is the most ideological - it is because they are engaging the most with the information environment of polarized elites?\n\n\nThe consequence of overestimating public polarization. Perceptions of public debate color individuals’ own opinions. As a consequence, overestimating the policy-related disagreement between self-described liberals and self-described conservatives lead citizens to report political opinions that are more extreme than they would with perfect information about where their peers stand.\n\n“I expect that the public would be even more centrist in its opinions if citizens more accurately guaged mass-level opinion.”\n\nI wonder how this relates to engagement via internet and via face-to-face.\n\nwe are back to a mutz/deliberation/information story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nCitizens are not that polarized\n\nin the ideological polarization conception. See Fiorina v. Iyengar.\n\n“One might say that mass media may not be particularly influential in telling people what to think, or perhaps even what to think about, but media are tremendously influiential in telling people what others are thinking about and experiencing. These perceptions, in turn, have important consequences for the political behavior of mass publics and political elites as well.” - Mutz\nWhy might citizens perceive greater polarization?\n\nelite polarization\n\nespecially on the conservative side.\n\nelites polarization might drive people to think the masses are polarized.\n\ninformation environment increases the likelihood of extreme (liberal or conservative) elites.\n\n\n\nIn sum, today’s information environment may lead individuals to overestimate mass-level polarization multiple ways: through the use of a polarization narrative, through the role that partisan journalists play as exemplars of liberals and conservatives, and by transmitting information that elite political exemplars are, indeed, becoming more polarized.\n\nis affective polarization top-down?\n\n\nWhy do we care about people’s perceptions of polarization?\n\nerroneous beliefs about the public can affect individual attitudes and behaviors by leading individuals to shift toward perceived social norm.\n\n\n\n\nStudy 1: Misperceived Extremism in California\n\nResearch Design:\n\nTest the hypothesis that citizens tend to overestimate self-described liberals’ liberalism and self-described conservatives’ conservatives’ conservatism\nPop-representative survey of 2,444 registered voters in California in April and May of 2013.\nI collected either respondents’ own policy-related predispositions for two major policy domains in American politics or their perceptions of self-described liberals’ and conservatives’ predispositions.\n\nonly registered voters.\n\nwe can show that the politically active class of citizens in the nation’s largest state - a political entity unto itself - believe that the state’s population is more polarized than it actually is.\n\nsliding scale (1-7) question for two policy domains.\n\nrole of government in managing social welfare\nthe economy and the trade-off between portecting the environment and protecting jobs.\n\nOther question:\n\nuse the same sliding scale to denote where they thought “Californians who call themselves liberal” and “Californias who call themselves conservative” would place themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nDo California voters overestimate liberals’ liberalism and conservatives’ conservatism?\n\nyes.\n\nboth overestimate both groups’ extremism.\nand they overestimate extremism within their own ranks.\n\none group is most accurate:\n\nmoderates\n\nwhy?\n\ncould be information flows vis-a-vis other citizens?\n\nMutz?\n\nModerate citizens may be less politically engaged and less likely to receive messages about mass polarization from the media and other elites as a result.\n\nideological identifiers are more likely than true moderates to turn to the ideological and partisan media outlets that most heavily exagerate polarization.\nthis is still a Mutz relationship just a little more complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 2: The Effect of Misperceived Extremism on Political Attitudes\n\nWhat are the consequences of overestimating the degree of polarization within the state’s mass public?\n\nDo these erroneous beliefs about peers lead individuals to develop and report attitudes that are more extreme than they otherwise would?\n\n\n\nResearch Design:\n\nDo these misperceptions affect individuals’ political attitudes?\n“tell-ask” experiment\n\nthe design allows the true positions of liberals and conservatives to be provided to subjects assigned to the “tell” condition.\n\nmanipulates beliefs by REMOVING the ignorance.\n\nWhat is the average treatment effect of being fully informed of the true state of the world?\n\n\n“ask” condition:\n\n7 point scales\n3 screens\n\neach screen contained an ANES question\n\n“average positions taken by people who call themselves liberal and people who call themselves conservative”\n\n\n\nThey are going to compare the results of the “Tell” to the “Ask” respondents.\n\nDo the “tell” treatment\n\nThere is a third condition\n\ndistortion\n\nWhile results from the ‘’tell’’ and ‘’ask’’ conditions can determine whether misperceptions affect attitudes, comparing the ‘’tell’’ and ‘’distort’’ conditions can determine whether misinformation about polarization, decoupled from certainty, affects attitudes\n\n\n\nThe primary dependent concept of interest is the degree of extremity of policy opinions reported post-treatment. I asked for opinions on six speciﬁcpolicies, each of which was related to one of the broader policy dimensions used in the treatments.\n\n\nRecall hypothesis 2: those with the tell condition, moderate their beliefs. This is what we observe above.\n\nmoderates are only n=12\n\nnot good!\n\ncleaning up misperceptions reduces an individual’s own extremism.\nThis suggests that misperception of public polarization induces attitudes that are more extreme than they otherwise would be.\n\n\nThus: Is this just a Mutz solution?\n\nmore cross-cutting relationships can reduce partisanship as it changes the flow of information which moderates opinions.\n\nInterestingly, a similar pattern of across-the-board misperception emerges in Farwell and Weiner’s (2000) lab study of stereotypes of liberals and conservatives: members of both groups believe that ingroupmembers as well as outgroup members will behavein a more stereotype-conﬁrming fashion than theyactually do.\nTo a Zaller point, people don’t know their beliefs. This just provides a relative metric for respondents to better articulate their belief."

Shapiro. 2009. “A New Partisan Voter.” JOP. 71:1-24.\n\nLecture/questions:\n\nIs sorting and polarization the same thing? dumb question.\nMotivated thought:\n\nno one is really digging into the variance between education/types of people and ideology. I think the masses (lower stratum) are not any more ideological but they have sorted. They know the brand they associate with at an abstract level. What is going on then is the elites and upper stratum of the masses have grown more idealistic and polarized. The masses are simply just not paying attention to the policies of the parties per say (zaller), but they follow the cues given to them by the increasingly more polarized elites. They are polarized on attitudes but have sorted into the parties and now just follow the party as an abstract identity irrespective of the beliefs (to some degree) the party is supplying.\n\nseems like the authors might disagree? “It maybe be that this polarization is driven by a small segment of the public, while the rest remain more neutral independents. However, the evidence suggests that this is not the case. For example, according to the NES, the number of pure indepenedents among voters in the 2004 presidential eleciton was close to twice as many as in the 1952 election.”\n\nwait i have beef with this. This is regarding registered independents.\n\nAlso where is the discussion with Converse’s groupings of the masses ( the 5 levels or whatever it is)\n\n\nI want more discussion of Zaller in these.\nthere is an information story going on here.\nPaper respond to Converse.\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe American electorate today is different from that described in The American Voter. Both the 1950s era of ideologically innocent party voting and the subsequent period of partisan dealignment are over. Some political scientists began to describe the New American Voter as a new partisan evolution occurred. What has not been fully appreciated in the twentieth/twenty-first century history of voting studies is how partisanship returned in a form more ideological and more issue based along liberal-conservative lines than it has been in more than 30 years. This is visible in the strength of partisan voting, in the relationship between partisanship and ideology, and in the strength of the relationship of partisanship and self-reported liberal-conservative ideology to the public’s economic, social, racial, and religious attitudes and opinions. Not only has the public responded in a striking way to changes in politics and its context, but the current transformation has also appeared to be strikingly enduring and difficult to shake, based on survey evidence for this new partisan voter.\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nHas the American voter changed in any fundamental way since Campbell and Lazarsfeld’s description?\n\nTo what extent is the American voter in the early 21st century different from the American voter of past decades?\n\nTo what extent, then, has the American electorate polarized along party lines and in ideologically definable ways?\nHow do we explain apparent fluctuation in the power of party identification to predict the vote?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\n\nTheory/Argument:\n\n“What has not been fully appreciated in the twentieth/twenty-first century history of voting studies is how partisanship has returned in a form that is both more ideological and more issue based along liberal-conservative lines than it has been in more than 30 years.”\nIn The American Voter, many voters were ideologically innocent.\n\n“ideologically innocent voters is over.”\n\nBIG 2 DEBATES IN LITERATURE:\n\nthe “democratic competence” of the American public\n\nin the classics, people knew very little about facts and limited effect of policy issues.\n\nand how voters are influenced by longer-term partisan factors and shorter term election-specific factors.\n\nMichigan v. Colombia.\n\nLazarsfeld - Colombia - sociological\n\nthey focused on the more prevalent socioeconomic bases of partisanship and the importance of interpersonal communication that reinforced the sociological influences on voting or provided new information on the current campaign.\ncross-pressure, the role of information, etc.\n\nCampbell - Michigan - social-psychological\n\nemphasized the deeper psychological aspects and influences of partisanship involving the enduring effect of the New Deal realignment (and its socioeconomic bases), affect, generational transmission, and how, in effect, psychological balancing and avoiding dissonance led voters to adhere to partisan predispositions at election time.\nthe idea of a partisan mass public is a characterization different from Campbell.\n\n\n\n“we examine both partisan and related influences on voting.”\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nWe find that this partisanship has voters more strongly anchored than ever before by left/right ideological thinking. This ideology is still steeped in economic issues, but it has become increasingly rooted in social issues and religious values. It also, even more so than earlier, has an important underpinning in racial issues.\nWe agree that states are a poor unit of analysis when studying political polarization and that a great many Americans take positions in the ideological center. However, what all this understates is that there have been real changes among a portion of the electorate consisting of liberals and conservatives as well as Democrats and Republicans who have continued to sort themselves on racial, social, and religious values issues.\nThe partisanship of today’s American voters is different: it is more connected to salient policy issues and to liberal-conservative ideological idenitification than it was at least as far back as the 1970s."

Like those scholars who emphasize the rational underpinnings of public opinion, we are skeptical of the notion that partisans ignore or reinterpret discrodant information.\n\nWe find that although citizens often lack specific information about day-to-day political events, they do update their overall assessments of national conditions and the capacities of the parties to handle important problems.\n\nPeople may assimilate new information about the parties and change their perceptions of the parties without changing the team for which they cheer.\nHow do people define themselves in relation to political groups?\nTo what extent are perceptions of these groups susceptible to change?\n\n\n\nPartisan Images:\n\nBook focuses on identification with social groups.\n\nthe parties have stereotypes\n\nWhat kinds of social groups come to mind as I think about Democrats, Republicans, Independents?\n\nWhich assemblage of groups (if any) best describes me?\n\n\n\nYouth have more frequent social changes.\nSocial identity theory - an individuals drive to achieve positive self-esteem\n\npeople attach themselves to socially valued groups, and those who are trapped in low-status groups either disassociate themselves or formulate a different way of looking a groups, such that this group is more prized than others.\n\nAUTHORS DISAGREE.\n\nWe focus on how people categorize themselves and remain agnostic about the uderlying psychological motives that impel people to form social identities such as party attachment.\n\nAT MOST, VOTERS CAN BE SAID TO BE MAXIMIZING THE FIT BETWEEN THEIR SOCIAL MORES AND THEIR SELF-CONCEPTIONS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParty Change:\n\nParty id is enduring but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t change.\n\neven with big events it is still slow to change.\n\n\n\n\nPlan of this book:\n\nPartisan affiliation is best understood as a form of social identity and the partisan stability is traceable to constancy in citizens’ primary group environment and their mental images of partisan groups.\n“Finally at the individual level, we have evidence that party attachments change as people migrate from one political environment to another…The fact that residential mobility affects partisanship further attests to the social dimension of party attachment.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Partisan Groups as Objects of Identification\n\nIdentification = 2 meanings\n\naffinity\n\na similarity or characteristics suggesting a relationship.\n\nself-categorization.\n\nThese often overlap\nPID is not an ephemeral opinion that is activated when closer to elections!

    "text": "Iyengar, Shanto, Gaurav Sood, and Yphtach Lelkes. 2012. \"Affect, Not Ideology: A Social Identity Perspective on Polarization.\" POQ . 76:405-31.\n\nThoughts:\n\non second reading, this kinda comes back to Lazarsfeld for me.\nin group and out-group dynamics.\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nthe current debate over the extent of polarization in the American mass public focuses on the extent to which partisans’ policy preferences have moved. Whereas “maximalists” claim that partisans’ views on policies have become more extreme over time (Abramowitz 2010), “minimalists” (Fiorina and Abrams 2009) contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occurred reflects sorting, i.e., the increased association between partisanship and ideology. We argue in favor of an alternative definition of polarization, based on the classic concept of social distance (Bogardus 1947). using data from a variety of sources, we demonstrate that both republicans and democrats increasingly dislike, even loathe, their opponents. We also find that partisan affect is inconsistently (and perhaps artifactually) founded in policy attitudes. the more plausible account lies in the nature of political campaigns; exposure to messages attacking the out-group reinforces partisans’ biased views of their opponents\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nin terms of affect, Americans are polarized along party lines.\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nIs the masses affectively polarized?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe mere act of identifiying with a political party is sufficient to trigger engative evaluations of the opposition, and exposure to prolonged media-based campaigns only reinforces these predispositions.\nOver time partisans’ ratings of the opposing party will turn increasingly negative.\nGiven the increasing divide between party elites and followers in their policy preferences, we might also anticipate some downturn in ratings of the in-party.\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nDebate around polarization:\n\nFiorina - minimalist - contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occured reflects sorting - increases association between partisanship and ideology.\nAbramowitz - maximialist - claim that partisans’ views on policies have become more extreme over time.\n\nIyengar argues for a new conception\n\naffective polarization\n\nthe extent to which partisans view each other as a dislike out-group\n\n\nThey ground their theory in social identity theory (Tajfel)\n\ngroup membership triggers positive feelings for in-group and negative evaluations of the out-group.\nbut people have multiple group memberships, which affiliations provide the most meaningful cues?\n\nsalience is important for that question.\n\n\nAuthors argue the campaign raises the salience of political membership\n\nthis I buy (obviously) but also there needs to be some discussion of the collapse of other group membership salience. Party membership has become such a defining identity and trumps many others at all times.\n\nThey kinda address this point, “Thus, greater exposure to the harsh rhetoric of political campaigns is one potential explanation of affective polarization.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod/Design:\n\nnational and cross-national survey\nUnited States and UK.\nfeeling thermometer\n1960 -2010\ninter-party social distance\n\nstereotypes of party supporters and feelings about marriage across party lines.\n\nCompare party affiliation with other prominent social cleavages in the United States, including gender, race, and religion, as bases for affective polarization.\nThen is affective polarization a consequence of ideological polarization\n\nOR is it a result of information changes (greater exposire to harsh rhetoric) specifiically through the campaign?\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nSix different survey data sets:\n\nANES\n\ntime series\n\n2008 YouGov (US and UK)\nAlmond and Verba 1960 five-nation study (from The Civic Culture)\n2004 Blair Center Election Study\nUS component of an eleven-nation study conducted by YouGov in 2010\nAP-Yahoo! News 2008 election study.\n\nWisconsin Advertising Project:\n\nads broadcast in the top 100 media markets during the 2004 elections.\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nWe show that Democrats and Republicans not only increasingly dislike the opposing party, but also impute negative traits to the rank-and-file of the out-party.\nDemocrats and Republicans generally rate their own party highly - and this has been stable.\nOutparty ratings however have dropped by some fifteen points since 1988.\n“activist” members are more affectively polarized.\n\nthere are more activists.\n\nnon-activist members have also grown more affectively polarized but not as much compared to the activist.\n\nthese are both related to measures on Democrats and Republicans\n\n\n\nAffective polarization toward liberals/conservatives is significantly less\n\ndemocrats evaluations of conservatives remain in the 40-50 range over the entire period\nHOWEVER, Republicans’ ratings of liberals are some 5-8 points lower.\n\nI feel like this is where Lilliana Mason’s work comes in.\n\n\nAffect doesn’t really move in response to election outcomes.\nConservatives would be more displeased if their child married an out-party.\nmarriage out-party was more important in the UK back in the 1960s\n\nthis has increased considerably in America.\n\nmore social distance in America than UK.\n\n\nTrait Ratings:\n\nmore stereotyping of out party.\nit was the Americans who expressed more positive views of party supporters and negative views of their opponents.\npositive traits for in-party supporters\n\n\n\n\nWhat explains the development of affective polarization?\n\n2 possible explanations:\n\nmovement in policy attitudes among the masses and the elites\n\nis affective polarization simply a symptom of divergent movement in policy attitudes among both partisan supporters and party elites? Basically is their spillover of ideological -&gt; affective\n\nnot strong evidence\n\nFor parties to be seen in ideological terms would require an awareness of their policy stances, yet most Americans have difficulty correctly locating parties on issue scales\n\n\n\nexposure to increasingly negative political campaigns\n\nthis is an operationalization of political top-down information flow.\n\ntest this by leveraging those who live in battleground states\n\nthey are exposed to greater negative campaigns.\n\neffect of exposure to negative ads is modest.\n\nthis is to be expected because negative ads represents a small share of the info stream.\npartisans in battleground states were especially likely to become polarized\noverall, our analyses suggest that greater levels of negativity in advertising campaigns and general exposure to political campaigns both contribute to higher levels of affective polarization."

Electoral Participation and the Development of Party Identification.\" AJPS 58:449-65.\n\nLecture Notes:\n\nLongitudinal data\nnatural experiment\n\nuses voting age change\n\nan experiment needs randomization and manipulation.\n\n\nthis is a regression discontinuity!\n\n\n\nPurpose:\n\nthis study considers how votes cast help us understand the perennial finding of age-related gains in strength of partisanship across the life cycle and addresses the selection problem through the use of vote eligibility as an instrument of actual vote.\nthis research calls to relax a rigid assumption made in the literature on voting behavior, namely the attitudes lead to behavior but not vice versa\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nParty identification is known to influence almost all aspects of political life. How this attachment develops across the adult life cycle, however, remains unknown. I argue that people reinforce their partisan predispositions by voting for their preferred party. Voting entails a choice over a set of alternatives. This choice is likely to induce rationalization. In so doing, it provides signals of group identity, which in turn strengthens people’s partisan ties. Testing this hypothesis is made difficult because it implies a reciprocal relationship between partisanship and vote choice. I address this problem by using vote eligibility as an instrument of vote in a sample of almost equally aged respondents. The results indicate that elections fortify prior partisan orientations. Moreover, they do so not by increasing political information. Rather, it is the act of voting for a party that, itself, bolsters partisan attachment. This act leaves a long-lasting imprint on people’s partisan outlooks.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nvoting strengthens PID which helps explain why older people are rigid in beliefs.\n\nmay also explain why voter turnout is higher at older ages.\n\nElections are partisan affirming events.\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nHow do enduring partisan ties come into being?\nPeople do change partisanship throughout life, even as adults. Why?\n\npolitical socialization at early age is not enough to explain this.\n\nPartisanship increases as people get older, why?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nI argue that elections matter but in a different way. Participating in the electoral process means converting a preference into a behavioral choice. The resulting sense of commitment intensifies the link between the individual and the party.\n\nthis mechanism seems like people post hoc justify and dig in as their vote as a commitment.\n\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nRepeated exposure to the same political context, Converse argued, fosters enduring partisan sentiments, which are then transmitted to coming generations through political socialization.\nlength of one’s experience with the political system is important\n\nhow this experience translates into increased partisan support, however, has been left an open question.\n\nWhatever is causing partisanship to strengthen with age is boosting partisan ties irrespective of shifts in how the parties are differentiated on policy and in the extent of their electoral success.\nParty identification is strengthened when individuals convert a partisan identity or leaning into a behavioral choice through the act of voting, and it is weakened when the two are at odds.\npartisanship increases overtime\nelections may be important because they give the opportunity to individuals to confirm or reaffirm their identity by casting a vote for their preferred party.\nIt is this idea that is of particular interest here. Once people make a choice over a set of alternatives, they become more favorable toward their initially preferred alternative. This logic can be directly applied in the case of elections. Having opted for one of the parties leads voters to think of the party more positively than they had before the election.\n\n\n\nData:\n\nI employ all four waves of the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study, 1965–1973–1982–1997"

Cities Fiorina.\n\nThis was written before affective polarization which comes to dominate how we think of the public and polarization.\n\n\n\nThe Origins of Division: Gerrymandering or Conspiracy?\n\nAuthor cites two reasons that are traditionally used to explain our polarized politics. These are both suspect to me.\n\n1) Gerrymandering\n\nnot strong support for this.\n\n2) Holds that conservative activists built an interlocking structure of propaganda and money that moved the Republican party, and the nation, to the right.\n\nThis is kind of a democratic theory he describes:\n\nRepublicans post Goldwater built a tightly wound, highly coordinated movement from the top down. Corporations and foundations paid for think tanks and advocacy groups, which supplied the movement with ideas and leaders. The right created its own media. etc.\n\n\n\nAuthor argues those previous points are top down. What about bottom up?\n\nthere is more freedom to move. Americans have greater mobility to have neighborhoods reflect their opinions.\nThe Big Sort is about this bottom up shift.\n\n\n\n\nThe Politics of Place: What’s the Matter with Ohio?\n\n“Fenton…showed upper-class voters lived in tightly knit, geographically compact communities. Physical proximity made it easier for them to maintain political cohesion, to move and vote in an ideological herd.”\n“In nearby Michigan, Gimpel said, working-class voters lived close to one another, and their geographic proximity powered their ideological and political intensity. In Ohio, however, workers were spread out, and the effect of this diffusion…was profound…The postman did not talk the same language as his accountant neighbor, and the accountant was in a different world from the skilled workman at Timken Roller Bearing who lived across the street…The disunity of unions and the Democratic party in Ohio was a faithful reflection of the social disorganization of their members.”\n\ngiving shades of Marxist geography readings.\n\npage 36!!!!!! REALLY GOOIOOOOD!\n\n“Unlike Ohio of the early 1960s, political divisions today are as much a result of values and lifestyle as they are of income and occupation. And with those divisions has come a pervasive and growing separation. Americans segregate themselves into their own political worlds, blocking out discordant voices and surrounding themselves with reassuring news and companions.”\n\nso good!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: The Politics of Migration\n\nbumper sticker: Mechanism: Opposites do NOT attract.\nconservatives are more into parenthood.\nmore domestic migration to republican counties\n\nokay but why\n\nmight this be because republican counties were cheaper? ie land, rent, home cost?\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: The Psychology of the Tribe\n\n“Legislators had a decided aversion to sharing their mess table, their living quarters, and their leisure hours with colleagues from regions other than their own”\n\nthis is interesting. Recall Madison’s point about the state being the important community.\n\nThe cultural segregation in early America was enforced by the lack of mobility, whereas today it’s the ease with which Americans are able to move that has created political segregation.\nCongress living in segregated housing.\nWhat we think of what we hear or see or read depends largely on who said it, did it, or wrote it, and we are likely to find evidence that confirms our preconceptions.\nface-to-face contact is powerful. The George W. Bush campaign, especially in 2004, used face-to-face contact among culturally similar people to increase voter turnout.\nMixed company moderates; like minded company polarizes.\n\nwhy though?\n\n2 possible mechanisms:\n\n1) people in single-minded groups are privy to a large pool of ideas and arguments supporting the dominant position of the group.\n2) People are constantly comparing their beliefs and actions to those of the group. When a person learns that others in the group share his or her general beliefs, he or she finds it socially advantageous to adopt a position slightly more extreme than the group average.\n\npeople grow more extreme within homogeneous groups as a way to conform.\n\non Saint Paul: “The disciple knew that going overboard in his pursuit of Christians served him well in the homogenous society of the Jews. Paul explained that he”profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.”\n\n“any successful talk radio host has realized, like Paul, that acclaim (and ratings) accrue to the most zealous\n\n\nMadison and Hamilton saw heterogeneity as a source of strength.\nThe “constant clashing of opinions” that Brutus feared wasn’t to be avoided, according to the federalists. It was to be sought after.\nDavid Campbell: an even mix of dems and reps increases voter turnout - good source for walkability paper.\nRobert Huckfedlt: as communication between members of the parties diminishes, the two sides come to see each other as more extreme or radical.\nMutz: lots of choice gives people the opportunity to sort themselves with people similar."

It will here be argued, however (1) that the implications of this particular function of competition have not been adequately spelled out and (2) that a major alternative mecahnism can come into play weither when the competitive mechanism is unavailable or as a complement to it.” p.2\n\n\nEnter Exit and Voice\n\nPerformance of a firm can go down for some reason.\n\nthis deterioration in performance is usually reflected in a deterioration of the quality of the service/product\n\nmanagement finds out about this through two routes:\n\nSome customers stop buying the firm’s products or some members leave the organization: this is the exit option.\n\n“exit belongs to the former realm” p.15\n\nI don’t think this is exclusive to econ. maybe he elaborates later?\nMilton Friedman advocates for this with school vouchers.\n\nParents could express their views about schools directly, by withdrawing their children from one school and sending them to another, to a much greater extent than is now possible. In general they can now take this step only by changing their place of residence. For the rest, they c’an express their views only through cumbrous political channels.\n\nthis almost will certainly exacerbate inequities present.\n\nHirschman seems to disagree with Friedman as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firm’s customers or the organizations members express their dissatisfcation directly to management or to some other authority to which management is subordinate or through general protest addresseed to anyone who cares to listen: this is the voice option.\n\n“voice belongs to the political realm” p.15\n\ndecentralization has been advocated in schools to make “voice” option less cumbrous\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of the book:\n\nUnder what conditions will the exit option prevail over the voice option and vice versa?\nWhat is the comparative efficiency of the two options as mechanisms of recuperation?\nIn what situations do both options come into play jointly?\nWhat institutions could serve to perfect each of the two options as mechanisms of recuperation?\nAre institutions perfecting the exit option compatible with those designed to improve the working of the voice option?\n\n\n\n\nBook continued\n\nEconomic growth and technical progress does not erect secure barriers against despotism, anarchy, or irresponsible behavior.\nCommon assumption of past work (and even today): While technical progress increases society’s surplus above subsistence it also introduces a mechanism of the utmost complexity and delicacy, so that certain types of social misbehavior which previously had unfortunate but tolerable consequences would now be so clearly disastrous that they will be more securely barred than before.\nThere is always decay. How decay comes about is not really relevant. The point is, decay marshals counterforces against it.\n“Tradition seems to require that economists argue forever about the question whether, in any disequilibrium situation, market forces acting alone are likely to restore equilibrium. Now this is certainly an interesting question. But as social scientists we surely must address ourselves also to the broader question: is the disequilibrium situation likely to be corrected at all, by market or nonmarket forces, or by both acting jointly? It is our contention that nonmarket forces are not necessarily less ”automatic” than market forces.” p.18\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Exit\n\nIf there is to be a drop in quality it is desirable that it be of the size which leads to recuperation.\n\nGoldilocks - “just right” equilibrium that allows identification and reaction to be marshalled by managers.\n\nExit might not be terrible insofar as the firm acquires new customers as it loses old ones\n\nreminds me of gentrification.\n\nvoters exit the city not by choice but by economic force.\n\nhe mentions this occurring though if there is a industry quality decline.\n\n\n\n\nVoice\n\neconomist seem to scoff at this option (at the time).\nTo resort to voice, rather than exit, is for the customer or member to make an attempt at changing the practices, policies, and outputs of the firm from which one buys or of the organization to which one belongs.\n\nVoice is here defined as any attempt at all to change, rather than to escape from, an objectionable state of affairs, whether through individual or collective petititon to the management directly in charge, through appeal to a higher authority with the intention of forcing a change in management, or through various types of actions and protests, including those that are meant to mobilize public opinion.\n\nVoice in the realm of politics can backfire.\n\nOne reason, stressed by Robert Dahl, is that the ordinary failure, on the part of most citizens, to use their potential political resources to the full makes it possible for them to react with unexpected vigor-by using normally unused reserves of political power and influence-whenever their vital interests are directly threatened.\n\nfire quote.\n\n\nVoice option is the only way to react when exit option is not available.\n\nrole of voice increases as the opportunities for exit decline\n\ninequities in voice option are real.\n\nthis to me is especially true in the realm of housing.\n\n\n\nThree general statements between voice and exit can be made:\n\n(1) In the simple model presented up to no,v, voice functions as a complement to exit, not as a substitute for it. Whatever voice is forthcoming under those conditions is a net gain from the point of view of the recuperation mechanism.\n(2) The more effective voice is (the effectiveness of exit being given), the more quality-inelastic cam demand be without the chances for recuperation stemming from exit and voice combined being impaired.\n(3) Considering that beyond a certain point, exit has a destructive rather than salutary effect, the optimal pattern from the point of view of maximizing the combined effectiveness of exit and voice over the whole process of deterioration may be an elastic response of demand to the first stages of deterioration and an inelastic one for the later stages.\n\nIf the matter is put in this way it is immediately evident, however, that the decision whether to exit will often be taken in the light of the prospects for the effective use of voice. *****\n\nif customers are sufficiently convinced that voice will be effective, then they may well postpone exit.\n\nThere is a loyalty variable that relates to voice and exit.\n“Voice is costly and conditioned on the influence and bargaining power customers and members can bring to bear within the firm from which they buy or the organizations to which they belong.\nThe presence of the exit alternative can therefore tend to atrophy the development of the art of voice.\n\n\n\nChapter 4: A Special Difficulty in Combining Exit and Voice\n\n“While it is most clearly revealed in the private-public school case, one characteristic is crucial in all of the foregoing situations: those customers who care most about the quality of the product and who, therefore, are those who would be the most active, reliable, and creative agents of voice are for that very reason also those who are apparently likely to exit first in case of deterioration.” p.47\n\nthis exactly housing and local governance.\n\nThe crucial point can now be made. For anyone individual, a quality change can be translated into equivalent price change. But this equivalence is frequently different for different customers of the article because appreciation of quality difers widely among them. p.48\n\na given deterioration in quality will inflict very different losses on different customers.\n\n“When general conditions in a neighborhood deteriorate, those who value most highly neighborhood qualities such as safety, cleanliness, good schools, and so forth will be the first to move out; they will search for housing in somewhat more expensive neighborhoods or in the suburbs and will be lost to the citizens’ groups and community action programs that would attempt to stem and reverse the tide of deterioration.” p.51\npage 53!\n\n\n\nChapter 6: On Spatial Duopoly and the Dynamics of Two-Party Systems\n\nso far this seems like downs\nHe just cited Hotelling.\nHotelling and downs assume no elasticity!\n\nactually not quite. see p.69\n\ncounterbalances elastic demand with the assumption of a more or less normal frequency distribution of the voters from Left to Right.\n\n\n“For voice to function properly it is necessary that individuals possess reserves of political influence which they can bring into play when they are sufficiently aroused.\nWhy Goldwater?\n\nidealistic voters were far more active than the middle-of-the-roaders.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7: Loyalty\n\nAbility to exercise exit or voice is in part dependent on the entity.\ndoes exit make loyalty less likely? Does it give more scope to voice?\nThe importance of loyalty from our point of view is that it can neutralize within certain limits the tendency of the most quality-conscious customers or members to be the first to exit.\nLoyalty is a key concept in the battle between exit and voice not only because, as a result of it, members may be locked into their organizations a little longer and thus use the voice option with greater determination and resourcefulness than would otherwise be the case. It is helpful also because it implies the possibility of disloyalty, that is, exit. Just as it would be impossible to be good in a world without evil, so it makes no sense to speak of being loyal to a firm, a party, or an organization with an unbreakable monopoly. While loyalty postpones exit its very existence is predicated on the possibility of exit. That even the most loyal member can exit is often an important part of his bargaining power vis-a-vis the organization. The chances for voice to function effectively as a recuperation mechanism are appreciably strengthened if voice is backed up by the threat of exit, whether it is made openly or whether the possibility of exit is merely well understood to be an element in the situation by all concerned. p.82\nTwo conclusions stand out from this discussion: (1) the detail of institutional design can be of considerable importance for the balance of exit and voice; (2) this balance, in turn, can help account for the varying extent of internal democracy in organizations.\nkinda a problem if you are super loyal but if you threaten exit and the firm gets worse it may hold you back.\nParents who plan to shift their children from public to private school may thereby contribute to a further deterioration of public education. If they realize this prospective effect of their decision they may end up by not taking it, for reasons of general welfare or even as a result of a private cost-benefit calculation: the lives of both parents and children will be affected by the quality of public education in their community, and if this quality deteriorates the higher educational attainments of the children to be obtained by shifting them to private school have a cost which could be so large as to counsel against the shift.\nNow it can be shown that an invariant or even inverse relationship between these variables is possible. In the case of public goods, the member will compare, at any one point in the process of deterioration, the disutility, discomfort, and shame of remaining a member to the prospective damage which would be inflicted on him as a prospective nonmember and on society at large by the additional deterioration that would occur if he were to get out.\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Exit and Voice in American Ideology and Practice\n\nThe United States owes its very existence and growth to millions of decisions favoring exit over voice\n\npolitical system was populated by people coming from other places.\nmanifest destiny.\n\nThe preceding considerations are relevant here. Many of the reasons for which the United States citizen finds it impossible to consider exit from his country apply, in only slightly altered form, to the high official as he considers exit from the government. As the former cannot bring himself to contemplate exit from the “best” country, so the latter has an overwhelming desire not to sever his ties with the “best” country’s government which, moreover, is the world’s most powerful.\ntalks about how no one quits the gov anymore\n\nlmao def not true anymore"

    "text": "Critical to a healthy democracy is the political participation and active engagement of the citizenry (Dahl 2005). Who has access to the voting booth has critical consequences for whose voice is represented (Gilens and Page 2014). There are many ways for citizens to be politically involved but none are more prevalent than the action of voting. Given voting is the most widespread participatory action in politics and is that final choice made to decide the form of government, scholars have devoted considerable effort to understanding and predicting the factors that cause individuals to vote. However, because voting is not compulsory, understanding what ultimately causes someone to vote has led to numerous theories and factors.\nVoter turnout work tends to understand the drivers of voter turnout through either individual or environmental level factors (Campbell 1980) (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1968). Despite these two perspectives, what likely drives voter turnout is a combination of these factors. In the years since the development of the Columbia and Michigan models, scholars have identified the effects of political knowledge (Carpini and Keeter 1996), identity (Sides, Tesler, and Vavreck 2019), campaign effects (Farrell and Schmitt-Beck 2003), network socialization (Rolfe 2012), education (Sondheimer and Green 2010), convenience voting (Burden et al. 2014), parental socialization (Jennings and Niemi 1968), and many, many more (Plutzer 2002). Despite this vast literature, we still know very little about how physical space, or the built environment, can shape political behaviors.\nThe built environment is a concept heavily studied within the fields of urban planning and public health. The built environment is defined as the man-made structures, features, and facilities viewed collectively as an environment in which people live and work (Lawrence and Low 1990). Studies of the built environment struggle due to measurement issues and differences. We choose to operationalize the built environment by using a measure of walkability. Walkability is a closely related concept but is defined as the ease of walking to amenities within a given area (Forsyth 2015). We use our measure of walkability to study voter turnout in the 25 most populated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA). Previous studies of the built environment and political phenomenon have varied in their measurements and use surveys/case studies to study the effect on political participation. We provide the first known systematic national study of the built environment on political participation. To measure voter turnout, we use the L2 voter file aggregated to the Census block group level. We find a significantly positive association between walkability and voter turnout. We then field a survey to better understand what underlying mechanisms drive this association.\nOur results motivate greater attention to the relationship between the built environment and political phenomenon. The design of physical space has been rarely considered on political behavior. Because physical space structures how people interact and engage socially, how its’ design varies can lead to different political behaviors. In addition, its’ design is a collection of social choices made over time. By understanding how the built environment structures social interaction and thus political behaviors, we can better shape its formation to improve political outcomes more conducive to a healthy and equitable democracy."

    "section": "Cost of Voting",
    "text": "Cost of Voting\nThe action of voting always has some cost greater than zero (Riker and Ordeshook 1968). The higher the cost, the less likely it is for an individual to vote, all else equal. For the majority of voters, the action of voting is physical. Voting is not equal for all individuals. In addition to information costs, you must travel the polling location, potentially wait in line, and finally take the time to actually complete the process of voting. Election laws and convenience voting measures influence turnout and vary across states (Burden et al. 2014). However, the vast majority of voters (especially prior to COVID-19) cast their ballots in person on election day. While they find null results for voting, Hopkins and Williamson (2012) find harder forms of political participation such as protesting and going to a town hall were significantly impacted by distance.\nThe ability of walkability to reduce the cost of voting is driven primarily through the benefits it provides in transportation options. The farther the polling booth is from where an individual lives, decreases their likelihood to turn out (Brady and McNulty 2011). Gimpel and Schuknecht (2003) provides additional evidence, finding that voter turnout in reduced in suburban precincts when the polling location is between 2-5 miles away. Given much of American society is car-centric, transportation issues can magnify the cost of traveling to the polls. A walkable environment not only provides the opportunity to walk to the polls but it provides alternative transportation options to be utilized such as subways, buses, or bikes. Thus a walkable environment can reduce the objective cost of traveling to the polls.\nA walkable environment may reduce the perceived cost of voting. Studies from other disciplines, find built environments conducive with a walkable environment influence walking patterns. The action of walking can reduce stress, improve mental and physical health, and increase cognition (Finlay et al. 2022) (Johansson, Hartig, and Staats 2011) (Roe and Aspinall 2011). So while a walk could take an individual longer to physically travel to the polling location, their perceived effort might be lower than if they had drove. Given these benefits, walking may reduce the perceived effort required to vote and thus reduce the cost of voting, increasing their likelihood to turnout."

    "section": "Social Capital and Political Socialization",
    "text": "Social Capital and Political Socialization\nSocial interaction can expose people to different politically relevant information (R. Huckfeldt 2001). The type of social context one inhabits can have a major effect on how an individual participates politically (R. R. Huckfeldt 1979). The design of the built environment we argue can shape how social contexts are formed and thus, the character and frequency for who you interact with. A walkable area increases the frequency of face-to-face interactions (Van den Berg, Sharmeen, and Weijs-Perrée 2017). A walkable environment is mediated through two mechanisms for voter turnout: unscripted contact and facilitated recruitment (Hopkins and Williamson 2012).\nGreater unscripted contact increases the prevalence of weak ties. Weak ties are theorized to be vital in fostering and sharing new ideas (Granovetter 1983). Given walkability increases the frequency of interactions between strangers, there is a higher possibility these interactions can snowball into a more connected and trustworthy community. Jacobs (1992) echo’s the importance of city design in shaping social networks:\n\nThe trust of a city street is formed over time from many, many little public sidewalk contacts…Most of it is ostensibly trivial but the sum is not trivial at all.\n\nA civic culture is a politically active culture (Almond and Verba 2015) (Putnam 2000). When an area is constructed to increase the frequency of physical interaction, more network relationships can form and thus more facilitated recruitment may occur. A walkable environment is thus conducive in developing greater civic skills, a critical component of Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995)’s resource model of participation. While socioeconomic factors can lead to variation in the resource model, McClurg (2003) shows social interaction enhances engagement with group membership and political participation, contingent on the amount of political discussion within the network. Critical to walkability’s impact on political participation is then mediated through it’s ability to foster greater social interaction. Further, greater civic participation can lead to greater social capital and foster more forms of social bridging and bonding (Putnam 2000). An individual’s sense of of civic duty rises increasing their likelihood to participate politically (Riker and Ordeshook 1968).\nInformation gain can arise from increased network interaction and diversity (R. Huckfeldt 2001). Political knowledge of current events and the structure of government vary wildly (Carpini and Keeter 1996) (Bartels 2005). While political information can be received through multiple pathways, face-to-face interactions are unique as they are both unfiltered and potentially more personal than media (Carlson 2019). While these interactions can lead to false information, simple conversation still makes politics salient and indicates larger social networks can influence the flow of political information (R. Huckfeldt et al. 1995).\nFinally, Increased social interaction may influence an individuals level of altruism (Fowler 2006). Thus, greater social interaction facilitated through walkability increases care for others, motivating greater political participation. Engagement within your community fosters greater care for you community (Fitzgerald 2018). Thus, the more frequent interaction you have with others may motivate individuals to care more deeply about their political agency.\n\nSocial Pressure\nWhile greater face-to-face interaction may encourage individuals to participate more in civil society and ascribe greater purpose in voting, walkability may also induce greater social pressure on individuals to vote. Previous work shows exposure to others voting can dramatically increase the likelihood of someone voting (Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2008). Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008) argue the threat of shame can induce specific behaviors. While they test non face-to-face interactions, they do find that when neighbors are exposed for not voting, they can be pressured to vote in future elections. In face-to-face interactions, political conversations may arise and thus individuals may be inclined to avoid ostracism or shame by voting. The threat of someone asking you in person may even have a more pronounced effect than the turnout mailings Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008) used. Given walkability increases social interactions within an area, it is likely these types of conversations may arise more frequently than otherwise and foster greater social pressure to vote. Face-to-face interaction and exposure to others voting is shown to increase voter turnout (Gerber and Green 2000) (Arceneaux, Kousser, and Mullin 2012) (Fortier 2006) (Funk 2010).\nThe greater frequency of political conversations in weak tie network increases the amount of possible mobilizing agents and thus facilitated recruitment towards the action of voting. Previous work has found neighbors that talk together, vote together, indicating a neighborhood socialization effect on partisanship (Pattie and Johnston 2000). Rolfe (2012) provides additional support for the role of social pressure by arguing the decision of an individual to vote is conditional on the vote decisions of friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers. The amount and interaction of these actors within an individual’s social network have a powerful mobilizing influence over an individual’s likelihood to vote.\nThus, we see walkability’s influence on voter turnout has multiple pathways that we categorize into three potential mediating mechanisms. (1) Walkability can reduce both the objective and perceived cost of voting. (2) Walkability can increase weak tie network formation and increase individual’s sense of civic duty to participate politically. (3) Walkability increases the exposure of election activities both from the campaign and other citizens engaging the voting process, increasing the social pressure to participate in voting.\nGiven these potential mechanisms, we theorize the following:\n\\(H_1\\) Communities with higher walkability will have higher voter turnout.\n\\(H_2\\) Walkability reduces the perceived cost associated with voting\n\\(H_3\\) Walkability increases political socialization and increases voter turnout.\nThe paper proceeds by first testing whether a relationship exists between walkability and voter turnout. We find a positive association. To test how these theorized mechanisms mediate this association, we field a survey experiment."

    "text": "Independent Variable: Walkability Index\nOur independent variable is walkability. Walkability is defined as the ease of walking to amenities within an area (Forsyth 2015). We use walkability to operationalize the built environment because it captures the layout of an area and mutes variation in architectural design. While previous research has found evidence between architectural features and voter turnout, we are only concerned about the built environment from an urban planning perspective (LeVan 2020). This measurement decision is supported by previous work on the varying suburb types and political participation (Hopkins and Williamson 2012).\nIt is important to separate walkability from population density. Oliver (2001) argues greater density should reduce political participation in municipal elections. While we do not test walkability on municipal elections, Oliver (2001)’s point is still important. Population density refers to the amount of people in one area. A highly dense area does not necessarily mean it is walkable. Similarly, a walkable area does not necessarily mean that it is a dense area. An example of this phenomenon may be a Boston suburb that is not relatively dense in population but is walkable.\nTo measure walkability, we use the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) walkability index. The walkability index scores all Census block groups from least to most walkable on a 0-20 scale. With 0 being the least and 20 the most walkable. The walkability index was created in 2018 and is time invariant. The EPA measures walkability using the following formula:\n\\[\nNational\\ Walkability\\ Index=(w/3)+(x/3)+(y/6)+(z/6)\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(w=intersection\\ density\\)\n\\(x=proximity\\ to \\ transit\\ stops\\)\n\\(y = employment \\ mix\\)\n\\(z = employment \\ and \\ household \\  mix\\)\n\nSummary statistics for the walkability index used in our data-set can be found in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Turnout data is sourced using the L2 voter file accessed through the Redistricting Data Hub, a nonprofit that purchased the file for use towards research on gerrymandering.\nTurnout data is available for earlier elections cycles. However, we choose to focus only on turnout in the 2016, 2018, and 2020 election cycles. Because the walkability measure is time invariant and is only measured at the time of its creation in 2018, we limit our scope to only these three election years. Given the built environment is a culmination of buildings constructed over many years, and typical construction of a building can take anywhere from 6 to 17+ months (CENSUS CITE), the change in walkability is likely negligible between the periods observed. We feel less confident with this assumption as we extend the election periods to before 2016."

    "text": "Unit of Analysis\nBecause the walkability index is measured at the Census block group level, our unit of analysis is a Census block group in an election. The types of boundary chosen can dramatically influence how we measure walkability. Zip codes are unreliable and have fluid boundaries, making it difficult to assign a systematic walkability score. Census tracts are more advantageous as they are less fluid and systematically defined by the Census bureau. However, Census tracts can still range considerably in size and not properly capture how an individual operates within their ‘neighborhood’. We recognize how one defines their ‘neighborhood’ is entirely subjective (Wong et al. 2020). However, Census block groups can minimize this concern as its size captures more local impacts of an individual’s built environment, capturing the immediacy of amenities that surround an individual. A Census block group is a unit of spatial aggregation that is smaller than a Census tract but larger than a Census block. A Census block group is the combination of Census blocks for a given area. Previous studies have varied in which geographical aggregation to utilize.\nWe restrict our focus of walkability to only the 25 most populous Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA). The list of MSAs in our study can be found in table 3. MSAs are a variation of the census defined “core based statistical area”. MSAs can span multiple states and are defined by having at least 50% of their population in urban areas, at least 50,000 population, and include surrounding areas with strong economic ties. Our choice to only focus on Census block groups within the 25 most populous MSAs is because we are only interested in urban design variability. MSAs do contain rural areas and provide sufficient variability in their walkability. If we were to include all Census block groups in the United States, our model would be clouded by the presence of rural census block groups.\nSome readers may question the effect of our choice of aggregation. To quell these potential concerns, we re-estimate a model using a logit at the individual level using the L2 voter file. The results of this model can be found in Appendix TK.\n\nTable 3.

Grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, and retail shops are just a short walk away, and people are out and about.  It is a vibrant, socially-connected community where people know each others’ names, notice things, and expect people to look out for one another.\n\n\n\nOutcomes:\nEach respondent is then asked three questions on a 0-10 scale, with 0 = extremely unlikely; 10 = extremely likely. The question order is randomized for all respondents. These questions serve as our dependent variable and are as follows:\n\nHow likely would you be to vote in presidential elections if you lived in this community?\nHow likely would you be to vote in local and off-year elections if you lived in this community?\nHow likely would you be to vote in nonpresidential elections (like midterms) if you lived in this community?"

vs Gargantua\n\n\nArgument:\n\nThe assumption that each unit of local government acts independently without regard for other public interests in the metropolitan community has only a limited validity\n\nadvocate for “polycentrism”\n\n\n\n\nPolycentrism:\n\nconnotes many centers of decision making which are formally independent of each other\nWe view the “business” of governments in metropolitan areas as providing “public goods and services\n\n\n\nThe Nature of Public Goods and Services\n\nWhat gives rise to public goods?\n\n(1) public goods arising from efforts to control indirect consequences, externalities, or spillover effect\n(2) public goods provided because some goods and services cannot be packaged;\n(3) public goods consisting of the maintenance of preferred states of community affairs\n\nin footnote 3:\n\nCollaboration and competition among governmental units may also, of course, have detrimental effects, and require some form of central decision-making to consider the interests of the area as a whole.\n\n\n\nPublic Good:\n\n“…the line between private and public is to be drawn on the basis of the extent and scope of the consequences of acts which are so important as to need control whether by inhibition or by promotion.”\n\nexternalities or spill-over efects.\n\nA function of government, then, is to internalize the externalities-positive and engative-for those goods which the producers and consumers are unable or unwilling to internalize for themselves, and this process of internalization is identified with the “public goods.”\ndifferent “publics”\nthe maintenance of preferred states of community affairs*\n\n\n\nPackageability\n\na private good must be “packageable”, susceptible of being differentiated as a commodity or service before it can be readily purchased and sold in the private market.\n\nyou can exclude people.\n\npublic goods allow for free-riders.\n2 problems with public organization:\n\npublic goods are generally not measurable.\nthe assessment of costs upon persons who can benefit without paying directly for the good.\n\nIf we think of the public good as a maintenance of preferred states of community affairs, then we can make a modification to packageability\n\nextending the exclusion principle from an individual consumer to all the inhabitants of an area within designated boundaries.\n\nthink of a home heating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale Problems in Public Organiation\n\nboundaries are very important.\nSmog in Pasadena is a result of other cities and pasadena cannot control it because their border does not extend that far.\n\nthus the need for county control of smog.\n\n\n\nThe Criterion of Efficiency\n\neconomies of scale of a good may necessitate cities to act jointly.\nThe political design of a public organization\n\n1) scale of formal orrganization\n2) the public\n3) the political community\n\nPublic organizations may:\n\n1) reconstitute themselvess\n2) voluntaryily cooperate or failing cooperation\n3) turn to other levels of government in a quest for an appropriate fit among the interests affecting and affected by public transactions.\n\n\n\n\nThe Criterion of Local Self-Determination\n\nlocal self-government of municipal affairs assumes that public goods can be successfully internalized.\nthe choice of local public services implies there is variation across cities.\n\n\n\n\nPublic Organization in Gargantua\n\nGargantua does have an appropriate scale for certain public services.\nMost equipped to deal with metro-wide problems at the metro level.\nHowever it becomes very bureaucratic\nBureaucratic unresponsiveness in gargantua may produce frustration and cynicism on the part of the local citizen who finds no point of access for remedying local problems of a public character\n\nmunicipal reform may become simply a matter of “throwing the rascals out.”\n\nWe need to recognize the variety of smaller sets of publics that may exist within its boundaries.\n\n\n\nPublic Organization in a Polycentric Political System\n\nThe multiplicity of interests in various public goods sought by people in a metropolitan region can only be handled in the context of many different levels of organization.\nIf a polycentric political system can resolve conflict and maintain competition within appropriate bounds it can be a viable arragement for dealing with a variety of public problems in a metropolitan area.\n\n\nCompetition\n\nvariety gives rise to quasi market choice for local residents.\nwith appropriate public control, competitive arrangements may afford great flexibility in taking advantage of some of the economies of scale for the production of public services in a metro area, while, at the same time, allowing substantial diversity in their provision for the more immediate communities, based upon political responsibiltiy within local patterns of community identification.\n\n\n\nConflict and Conflict Resolution\n\nwhat happens when we have spill-over effects.\nthere is a heavy reliance upon courts for the resolution of conflicts among local units of government unquestionably reflects an effort to minimize the risks of external control by a superior decision-maker.\nwater rights is important\ncities can create informal arrangements to negotiate basic policies among local government agencies in a metro area.\n“Appeal to central authorities runs the risk of placing greater control over local metropolitan affairs in agencies such as the state legislature, while at the same time reducing the capability of local governments for dealing with their problems in the local context.”\n\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nPrevious view of metropolitans is that they have duplication of functions\n\nbunch of little governments.\n\nThis illustrates an important point, that the production of goods and services needs to be distinguished from their provision at public expense. Government provision need not involve public production-indeed, at some stage in the sequence from raw materials to finished products virtually every public good, not already a natural resource, is of private origin.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT!"

Feiock, ed., Georgetown University Press, pp. 17-45.\n\nIt sounds silly but we should probably define metropolitan at some point.\n“new regionalism” - governance structures not tied to a single dominant unit of metro government.\nGovernance is focused on the protection and enhancement of the public realm.\n\nSharing a common resource, we have learned form studies of collective action, is often problematic. The problems of sharing-from the scale of a household to the scale of the planet-constitute the agenda of governance.\n\nIt is impossible to maximize all such values at once in a finite world. Trade-offs are required, about which community members will often disagree, requiring joint deliberation. Governance as a process is centrally concerned with making these trade-offs.\n\nInstitutional design- which is the process of crafting a configuration of rules-is aimed at reducing the severity of the trade offs multiple values by shaping incentives in ways that encourage desirable behaviors.\n\n\n\nCoercion is not necessarily what govs have to use.\n\nto facilitate the process of governance, human beings create governance structures based on willing consent.\n\nGovernance is the work of people both inside and outside governments. - better conceived as cogovernance.\n“Governance structures are not the products of government mandates; rather, they are the world of civil society and therefore are based on a rule of willing consent.”\nstructure of gov -&gt; structure of governance\ncentral govs are more difficult to access.\nPolycentrism depends on the absence of dominance among various centers of authority, whereas monocentrism depends on a single center attaining dominance.\n\n\nAuthors Argument:\n\nThe argument I offer below is that polycentric systems of government allow for more open governance structures that include greater “civic space,” defined as the set of opportunities for nongovernmental actors to enter productively into the governance process by producing general benefits for a community.\n\npolycentrism depends on two institutional conditions:\n\n1) the existence of multiple independent centers of authority\n2) their interdependence must not be absolute.\n\npolycentrism thus describes a system of qualified independence among interdependent centers of authority.\n\n\n\n\nTocqueville’s Model of Local Governance:\n\nimportance of civil society.\ntownships\n\nsatisfied the first/second condition of polycentricity:\n\nthe existence of multiple, independent centers of authority.\nthe existence of limits on authority in recognition of interdependencies\n\ncourts become important.\nAmericans had extended the concept to include relationships between officials at different levels of gov.\n\n\n\n\nMetropolitan Institutions of Government:\n\nInstitutional Architecture:\n\ngov framework rests on an institutional base:\n\n1) small enough to function in a highly participatory manner\n2) in Tocqueville’s phrase, exhibit “independence and authority.”\n\nlocal governance is created by people not the state.\nInstitutional architecture of government in metro areas consist of:\n\n1) an institutional base that makes possible a broad functional base of citizen participation in local governance\n2) institutional overlay of intermediate governmental units that supplements local municipalities and school districts, substituting for them in limited ways as needed\n3) an insituttional framework that\n\n(a) uses a rule of law to limit the authortiy of local governments without diminishing their admin independence\n(b) conveys to citizens the key constitutional decisions concerning the formation and dissolution of local governments\n(c) reserves to state legislatures the ability to modify the arrangements specified in (a) and (b).\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernance Structures\n\ngovernment and civil society.\n\nbig in local governance.\n\ncounty gov principal role is to provide a forum in which municipalities can address common problems and resolve differences.\ncounty boundaries are very important!\nMunicipal govs are closely tied to civil society through patterns of voluntarism and civic association\nmunicipal govs enter into relationships with one another thorugh intergovernmental associations.\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Metropolitan Governance\n\ngovernance structure in metropolis has the following characteristics:\n\n1) higher levels of participation\n2) less adversarial, more consensual, style of politics\n3) strong representation\n4) a pervasive pattern of public entrepreneurship\n5) community differentiation and the self-sorting of residents\n6) patterns of accountability that greatly amplify the capabilities of individuals for self-governance.\n\n\n\nCitizen Participation:\n\nmunicipal size makes a substantial difference even in the midst of a large-scale metro area.\nParticipation is thus a function, not of social or psychological factros unconnected to municipal boundaries, but of the civic space created by small jurisdictions.\nOliver on participation:\n\n1) contact local officials\n2) attend board meetings\n3) attending organization meetings\n4) engaging in informal civic activity\n5) voting in lo cal elections.\n\n“The same negative relationship generally occurs between civic participation and city size.\n“smaller municipalities make participation easier, make citizens feel more empowered and interested in their communities, and bring neighbors together.”\nParticipation can be driven by two very different motivations:\n\n1) desire to contribute one’s community out of a sense of “self-interest rightly understood”\n2) a desire to protect one’s interests from attack by others\n\nOliver is conflict model of civic participation and which is different from Tocqueville’s conception of engagement as a product of shared identities, reciprocity, and common interests.\nLarge-scale governments without smaller nested governments create conflict by combining highly diverse interests in a single, comprehensive political jurisdiction.\nthe primary unit of government must be sufficiently small and homogenous to generate a nonadversarial style.\nPublic entrepreneurs must please the voter, but along the way they must attract an array of supporters-peers, other appointed officials, and elected representatives.\n\n\n\nCommunity Diferentiation:\n\nresidents can vote with their feet.\n“clearly, the prospect of declining property values can motivate both local citizens and local officials to tend to municipal problems. The key is to have in place a political jurisdiction with ample incentive to respond to problems. This must be a jurisdiction closely tied to the interests of local residents.”\nA single household may be subject to multiple governing agencies\nHow can an individual citizen keep track of and thus hold accountable such a large number of independent public officials?\n\n\n\n\nThe Effects of Alternative Prescriptions for Reform:\n\nI conclude that large scale metropolitan governments would lead to:\n\n1) greatly reduced citizen participation\n2) an exclusively adversarial style of politics\n3) dramatically lower levels of representation\n4) severely reduced levels of public entrepreneurship\n5) sharply weakened democratic accountability.\n\ndisagrees with Oliver’s solutions\nPolycentrism requires civic society.\npolycentrism creates civic space - opportunities for constructive engagement among citizen and officials."

Striving to protect property values and exclusive access to high quality public goods, the preferences of white property owners have been institutionalized through the vehicle of local land use policy, shaping residential geography for more than 100 years.\n\nThe maintenance of property values and the quality of public goods are collective endeavors. And like all collective endeavors, they require collective action for production and stability. Local governments provide this collective action. So, supported by land-oriented businesses, white homeowners have backed a succession of maneuvers to keep their property interests and public benefits insulated from change – even as cities have grown, aged, redeveloped, suburbanized, and adjusted to industrialization. Battles over the control of urban space have always been the primary driver of city politics. At stake is the quality of life accessible to residents and markets available to commercial interests. The result has been segregation by design.\n\n\n\nCamden:\n\nearly adopters of zoning.\n\nstrategically to conserve the value of property.\n\nmore black population.\n\n\n\nCherry Hill\n\nalso used zoning\nhostile against affordable housing.\ninequality in access to public goods was produced by local public policy.\nHomeownership = power\n\nmany races were excluded from owning a home.\nproperty owners dictated local governemnts.\n\nand pursued segregation.\n\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, advantaged and disadvantaged neighborhoods resided within the political boundaries of large central cities. In the second half of the century, when the suburbs captured most of the population growth, the physical and – more importantly – political distance between advantage and disadvantage widened. Today, the most advantaged places are located outside of central cities altogether so that disadvantaged residents have no direct role to play in decisions about building affordable housing, expanding public transportation, or diversifying schools. In these advantaged places, development is restricted and residents are politically conservative; they vote at higher rates for Republican presidential candidates, support low taxes, want limited spending, and see inequality as the result of individual failings.\n\n\n\nContributions to Existing Literature\n\nDahl argues city politics is inherently pluralistic\n\nEquality at the ballot box trumps social and economic inequalities\n\nseg by design disagrees with this.\n\n\nPeterson conflates white property owners’ interests with the interests of the whole city.\nthe protection of property values and public goods motivates local land use policy and generates inequality and polarization.\nFor instance, Tiebout's (Reference Tiebout1956) seminal article arguing that consumer-voters pick communities that best satisfy their preferences for public goods ignores the role of race, segregation, and inequality in these choices and is silent about the ways in which public goods packages are developed. In order for anyone to vote with her feet, she must first find a place to live. We cannot understand sorting (either to obtain a tax/public goods bundle or to avoid other racial groups) until we understand the ways in which housing choices, property values, and neighborhood character are structured by local governments.\nI argue that if we understand segregation as a mechanism to protect public goods and property values, increasing class segregation is predictable.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: A Theory of Segregation by Design\n\nlocal policies influence property value.\nsegregation is not organic or inevitable - it is a matter of design pursued through the political process, offering spoils to those with political power.\nproperty owners believe that local policy affects the value of their investments and the quality of life attached to their parcels, making them keenly attentive to the local political environment.\n\n\nThe Need for Local Government\n\nsegregation by race has declined since 1970 but segregation by class has increased since.\ntwo possible mechanism for segregation\n\nindividual preferences for same race and same income neighbors (tajfel vibe)\nand market explanations\n\nlocalg governments can affect the aggregate demographic makeup of communities and the spatial distribution of residents and services, thereby generating and enforcing segregation.\nschools are the biggest factor.\nAlthough cities do not (for the most part) handle the funding of schools, they play a key role in maintenance of this public good by using land-use regulation to shape who has access to which local public schools. School districts control school finances, but they cannot zone. Together, these circumstances have given property owners a powerful incentive to regulate who lives where since the earliest years of urbanization. White property owners have long been concerned with excluding certain types of people from their communities.\n\ngreat excerpt.\n\nSupreme Court had ruled racial zoning unconstintutional in 1917.\n\nHOAs were created in response. These organizations were often created by real estate develoeprs to protect the value of their investment.\n\nSuburbs were easier to maintain racial homogeneity.\nEinstein et al. (2017) provide evidence that the accumulation of regulations reduces the supply of multifamily housing by allowing residents opposed to development to delay the process and file lawsuits.\nrights-oriented conservatism was fueled in an envirionment of racial threat (integreation in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s) but became entrenched in an environment of racial isolation (whiteness of the neighborhood in the 1970s)\nThe marriage between rights-based conservatism and white perspectives on race was amplified in the crucible of city politics.\n\n\n\nThe Geography of Inequality:\n\nSegregation within cities and suburbanization across city lines has meant that the benefits experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and low-income individuals are inferior to the benefits experienced by whites and the wealthy.\n\nSecond, segregation generates political polarization between race and class groups and, ultimately, inhibits cooperation.\n\nShelley v. Kraemer was a major blow for white defense of neighborhood segregation.\n\nsuburbs became more attractive.\n\nsuburbanization also freed residents from having to fight for control of the city government.\n\n\nI wish there was more discussion of the romanticization of the suburb. She is so far looking at this from a purely racial/economic perspective.\nFocus: the various policies that local governments use to generate segregation, and the consequences of segregation for local and national politics.\nRacial and class segregation are both DVs and IVs\nwe cannot understand the development of class without race.\ntoday, local policies that generate class-based exclusion are generally upheld by courts, while race-based exclusion is not\nmy analysis suffers from an inability to disentangle selection from treatment: does living in a homogenous white neighborhood make people more conservative, or do people with conservative views move to homogenous neighborhoods?\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Protecting Investments\n\nThis chapter introduces the dataset\nalso charts and links changes in both demographics and service provision in metropolitan America, showing that segregation in later periods is associated with high property values and investment in public goods at earlier points in time.\nhomeownership, wealth, diversity, and density were all associated with expanding municipal governments\nI argue, explains why property owners and land-oriented businesses pursued residential segregation: to protect property values and capture public goods.\nmy geographical focus is on metropolitan areas as they were defined by the US Census of Population and Housing in the year 2000\nearly cities were volunteer ran (the public services at least)\nCity governments spent very little but this changes rapidly around the turn of the century. Why?\n\nThe most common view is to understand the growth of city government as the necessary response to the negative externalities of increased population growth and density such as pollution, congestion, conflagration, crime, and disease\nAnother essential driver of the development of municipal government was the desire to manage increasing racial and ethnic diversity in growing, compact cities.\n\nLandowners, seeking stability and profits, sought to attract population and commercial enterprises to their community. Investing in public services and infrastructure (and intensive advertising of these investments) was a strategy many places used to grow.\nDATA:\n\nper capita city expenditure\n\nexploded in growth from 1902 to 1937\n\n\nproperty owners were among the most supportive of investing in new services\ncities were responding to negative externalities of urbanizing\nFinally, in support of my argument, cities with more capacity and demand (higher property values, more homeowners, and more professionals) also had larger budgets.\nmeasuring class segregation\n\ndistribution of renters v. homeowners\nthe concentration of households in the top income threshold\n\nThe rise of suburbs decoupled residential spaces from job spaces and encouraged suburban residents to prioritize neighborhood amenities and property values in political decision making.\nResidents can be segregated in two ways: across neighborhoods within cities, or across cities within metropolitan areas. My measure combines these two types of segregation.\nAs explained previously, the H index measures the degree to which the diversity (E) of subunits differs from the diversity of a larger unit.\ncity-level segregation has remained remarkably persistent.\nthe correlation between race and renter segregation was 0.19. It rose to 0.32 in 2011. The correlation between race and wealth segregation increased from 0.46 to 0.51 over this same period. The link between race and wealth segregation across city lines is even stronger; it was 0.70 in 2011.\nPUNCHLINE: segregation along both race and class lines grew in tandem with the growth of cities\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Engineering Enclaves\n\ndebate about cause of segregation\n\nsome argue individual choices of white homeowners\nothers argue its local governance\n\nIn this chapter, I explore the factors that contributed to the adoption of zoning laws. I argue that zoning was enacted by political elites seeking to manage the distribution of public goods to their core supporters.\nAs Monkonnen indicates, it was far from obvious that cities would assert control over their environments, but the rapid spread of slums, worries about skyscrapers blocking natural light, fears of conflagration, and concern about public health threats provided early inspiration for cities to invoke their policy power of regulation over nuisances (Toll Reference Toll1969).Footnote3\nzoning is not the same as planning\nAs zoning practices spread through the 1920s, emphasis on the enhancement of property values became the dominant argument; almost universally, it was believed that the wrong sorts of people residing, or even working, in an area could negatively impact property values.\nIn fact, although Jim Crow laws were widespread, most southern cities did not legislate residential segregation directly\nFollowing Buchanan, many cities sought to enact constitutionally defensible racial zoning plans by turning to comprehensive city planning\nBy separating industrial, commercial, and residential uses into separate districts – each with standard regulations regarding the use, height, and area of buildings – zoning would make \"every town, city or village a more orderly, convenient, economic and attractive place in which to live and work\"\nIn Euclid v. Ambler (1926), Justice Sutherland explained that the apartment house is often a \"mere parasite, constructed to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings … interfering by their height and build with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the rays of the sun … depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play enjoyed by those in more favored localities … until, finally, the residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a place of detached residences are utterly destroyed. Under these circumstances, apartment houses, which in a different environment would be not only entirely unobjectionable but highly desirable, come very near to being nuisances\" (pp. 394–95).\nthe National Association of Realtors' code of ethics stated, \"A Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy, members of any race or nationality, or any individuals who presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood\" (Article 34 of Part III).Footnote\n\nThis perspective led to general support for the power of land-use regulation and zoning among real estate interests. Writing in 1924, Herbert Flint, a town planner from Cleveland, Ohio, explained that zoning plans should be developed by local planning commissions, populated with \"those well-positioned in real estate, the law, banking, manufacturing and transportation; also representative citizens who would safeguard the interests of the homeowners\"\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Adoption of Zoning\n\nI have argued that zoning was a tool that enabled elected officials to generate segregation, increase property values, and make it easier to target public goods to certain constituencies, and that it was successfully implemented where zoning supporters had political power.\nbut still not super popular in 1920s\nMy primary independent variables are per capita total expenditure and property taxes.\n\nexpect both to be positvely correlated. with zoning.\n\nI argue that schools are the most important public good for homeowners to protect. So, in an additional analysis, I replace property taxes with local expenditures on education.\nZoning adoption appears to have been led by the Republican Party, except in the South, where Republican voting strength limited the likelihood of adoption of comprehensive and racial zoning ordinances.\nThese results support the contention that zoning was a mechanism used to reinforce existing racial hierarchies.\n\n\n\nZoning Generates Segregation\n\nearly zoning adopters became more segregated cities\nMy dependent variables in these analyses are change in the level of race and class segregation between about 1900 and 1970.\nI expect that racial segregation will be most closely linked to racial and comprehensive zoning (as the historical discussion indicated), while class segregation will be tied to all forms of zoning. In the analysis of racial segregation, my independent variable is a dummy variable noting whether a city adopted either a race-based or comprehensive zoning ordinance in the period between 1900 and 1930. These early zoning adopters are coded 1, and cities that did not adopt racial or comprehensive zoning are coded 0.\ncities that were early adopters of zoning ordinances grew more segregated over the next fifty years, compared with cities that were not early adopters.\nLocal governments institutionalized prejudicial behavior and promoted segregation through the use of zoning ordinances.\nPolitical elites enacted zoning ordinances to generate growth and stability in property values and control the distribution of public goods in the city.\nIn 1917, the Supreme Court ruled racial zoning ordinances unconstitutional. In response, many cities turned their attention to comprehensive zoning plans and other forms of zoning that did not make racial segregation an obvious goal. New comprehensive city plans were fueled by continuing race and class prejudice, and influenced the long-term shift from racial segregation to segregation by income level.\nCities that were early adopters of zoning ordinances grew to be 10% more segregated over the following fifty years than did cities that were not early adopters.\n\nwould be interested to see if these early adopters saw increased migration from white residents to these cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Living on the Wrong Side of the Tracks\n\nsegregation makes it easier to produce inequalities in public service provision\nghettos were a combination of a single ethnic minority and bad housing\nWhites paid all of the taxes so it wasn’t a big deal to not support black citizens.\nThis chapter shows that between 1900 and 1940, neighborhoods that were identifiably poor or inhabited by minorities were allocated lower-quality serves, including road paving, public health efforts, and sewer extensions.\nseeing only through class lens is not complete. Race is separate and meaningful.\n\n\nJim Crow and Public Goods Inequalities:\n\nschooling is the most important service.\n\nuntil the mid 1930s, about 75% of public school revenues were completely locally derived.\n\n\n\n\nInequalities Generated through Residential Segregation:\n\nsewer and water lines are important in segregation tactics.\nMy theory predicts that nonwhite and renter households would have been less likely to have access to water and sewer connections in more segregated cities.\nThe dependent variable in the analysis is the total new segments built in each ward before the next census.\nThe key independent variables are the share of each ward's total population that is black and the share of occupied housing units that were rented (as opposed to owned). These demographic variables are interacted with each city's H index of segregation (for race and class, respectively) in a given census year.\nThe data indicate that in more segregated cities, heavily black and renter wards were unlikely to receive new sewer lines.\nAs was the case in the early period, between 1970 and 1990 renters and nonwhite residents continued to have inferior sewer access in more segregated cities.\nroad paving also unequal\n\nbut may this be unequal because rich whites could afford to purchase a car much earlier?\n\njk she explains that even in similar neighborhoods, white areas with similar income got roads paved before.\n\n\nThe historical record indicates that lower levels of segregation and more political power in the hands of blacks and the poor could mitigate such inequalities.\nToday, evidence indicates that segregation is maintained by white homeowners' willingness and ability to pay a premium to live among white, educated neighbors (Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor Reference Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor1999). That they have the opportunity to do so is dictated by past and present land-use regulations generated by city governments.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6: Cracks in the Foundation - Losing Control over Protected Neighborhoods\n\nlots of movement going on in 1940s\ncity govs utilized diff policies to prevent minority and poor neighborhoods from expanding into white neighborhoods.\nThis chapter and chapter 8 focus on the role of city politics in the generation of neighborhood segregation and suburnaization.\n\nif the drivers of segregation and suburbanization are similar, do white homewoners choose avenue of separation over another?\n\nfederal pressures to desegregate public schools led to an increase in segregated neighborhoods, as whites sought to utilize residential segregation to produce school homogeneity.\n\n\nUrban Renewal and Segregation\n\nbecause cities get money from property tax - the great depression messed up a lot of cities.\n\nneeded feds.\n\nCongress steps into housing legislation for like the first time\n\n1934 Housing Act and establishment of the Federal Housing Administration\n\nCongress had multiple goals: the reemployment of the construction industry, the shoring up of the financial sector, and the stimulation of home ownership. But these policies were also spurred by a commitment to residential segregation.\n\n\n\n\nthe Wagner-Steagall Act sought to \"provide decent, safe and sanitary housing for that large group of our population who [could not] afford to pay enough to cause private capital to supply their housing needs\"\nAllowing local governments to decide what land would be cleared and where new housing would be built virtually guaranteed the continuation and exacerbation of race and class segregation, because white homeowners and land-oriented businesses controlled city governments and planning commissions and opposed residential integration along either race or class lines.\n\nFurther, these interests quickly moved to ensure control of the new housing and renewal authorities created to direct and manage the process (Hirsch Reference Hirsch1983; Sugrue Reference Sugrue1996; Gotham Reference Gotham2001). Sugrue (Reference Sugrue1996) explains, \"[L]ocal governments had the final say over the expenditure of federal funds, the location of projects, and the type constructed\" (p. 60).\n\nDiscussion of HOLC and redlining.\nthe vigorousness with which a city pursued urban renewal affected the level of segregation after the completion of the program.\n\n\n\nRacially Contested Mayoral Elections:\n\nInterracial electoral competition was much more likely in more segregated cities.\nracially segregated cities were much more likely to experience interracial elections – even controlling for the share of the population that was white.\n\n\n\nFederal Desegregation of Schools and Increased Residential Segregation:\n\nChanges in fed gov made it harder for local governments to control neighborhoods and public goods.\ndesegregation orders significantly increased the share of neighborhoods that were both white defended and minority dominated. On average, desegregation orders generated about thirty new homogeneous neighborhoods in metropolitan areas. Homogeneity was achieved when whites moved within cities to new neighborhoods and to the suburbs.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7: Segregation’s Negative Consequences\n\nThe politics of segregated cities became polarized – pitting racially defined neighborhoods against each other. In turn, polarization made cooperation difficult. In segregated cities, local officials have trouble convincing residents to fund public goods.\nThis chapter provides evidence of the negative consequences of racial residential segregation.\n\n\nHow Segregation Creates Polarized Politics\n\nlocal politics is a battle over space\nOne of the few powers reserved, nearly exclusively, by local government is that of zoning or planning. When a city is residentially segregated by race, issues cleave along racial and not just spatial lines (Massey and Denton Reference Massey and Denton1998).\nNeighborhood racial isolation is associated with a high degree of racial intolerance, resentment, and competition among all racial groups (Oliver Reference Oliver2010).\n\nEnos as well.\n\nHowever, living in different types of neighborhoods may also change individuals' perspectives. In integrated neighborhoods, regular, casual interaction may work to counteract dominant, negative stereotypes\n\nENOS\n\nThe result of both population sorting and neighborhood influence is that individuals who live in homogeneous neighborhoods are more likely to harbor negative stereotypes about other groups\n\nENOS\n\nBecause segregation represents preferences or attitudes that are incompatible with collective investment, the uneven distribution of groups, not diversity per se, correlates with lower public goods spending.\n\n\n\nSegregation and Political Polarization\n\nI analyze the relationship between residential segregation patterns and racial divisions in mayoral elections in the nation's largest cities between 1990 and 2010.\nmore segregated cities are also more politically polarized\nAs the third column reveals, the relationship between segregation and polarization appears to be unaffected by the conservatism of the white population. In fact, the relationship between ideology and polarization is such that cities with more conservative white populations have smaller racial divides, underscoring the conclusion that racial polarization is not driven by ideological divisions.\n\n\n\nDiversity and Segregation in the Aggregate\n\ndoes segregation make it harder to reach consensus?\n\nif so, we should also see less support for government spending in segregated cities after accounting for racial demographics.\n\nsegregation and public goods spending are negatively related, even in the presence of changing demographics, diverse populations, and conservative residents.\nspending on public goods is lower in cities with greater segregation.\nAt low levels of segregation, white turnout is much higher than minority turnout, but the lines converge as segregation increases. Furthermore, using the racial polarization dataset described in the first section of this chapter, I find that turnout and segregation are positively correlated in the aggregate. These patterns strongly suggest that politics is more contentious in more segregated communities. Thus, a lack of participation by residents who support high spending is not likely to be the cause of lower public goods investment.\n\ninteresting.\n\n\n\n\nEvidence of Causality\n\nhard to assert that segregation causes lower public goods spending.\nShe uses an instrumental variable.\n\nwaterways because those are natural and different from roads and railways that were explicitly used to segregate.\nRECALL INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES:\n\nthe instrumental variable is theoretically relevant to X.\n\nWhat is our X variable?\n\nsegregation\n\n\nThe instrumental variable must satisfy the exclusion restriciton.\n\nZ -&gt; X -&gt; Y\n\nour IV is public good spending.\n\n\n\nnumber of waterways is used as an instrument for the H index (level of segregation in a city)\nDVs: direct general expenditure, roads, law enforcement, parks, sewers, welfare, Own source revenue\n\n\n\n\nSegregation and Sewer Overflows:\n\nsewer system is strongly related to capital fund-raising.\nthe vast majority of funding to reduce overflows comes from local sources\nthat more segregated cities will have more trouble coming to political consensus about public goods provision, then we ought to expect more segregated cities to witness more sewer overflows – all else equal.c\nlogged overflows per 1,000 persons measure serves as my dependent variable\nMy main independent variable is the city's H index of racial segregation, measured in 2000, if available, and 2010 if not\nThe data reveal a significant correlation between segregation and sewer overflows. Living in a city with very little segregation, one can expect about 1.5 overflows per year on average. This increases to nearly 2.5 overflows in cities at the ninety-fifth percentile of the segregation distribution. Not only do segregated cities see lower spending on public goods, but they also witness worse performance as well.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Locking in Segregation through Suburban Control\n\nSegregation between neighborhoods has declined BUT segreagtion between cities has remained stable and even rose.\nIn previous chapters, I argued that segregation was pursued by local governments to enhance property values and target local public goods toward white homeowners and land-oriented businesses. Such strategies, combined with political control of city councils and mayors' offices, ensured that local governments operated to protect the homogeneity of white homeowner neighborhoods, and provide them with disproportionate benefits.\nIn this chapter, I analyze the relationships between cities within metropolitan areas. I concentrate on the ways in which the politics of the central city (the city with the largest population in the metro area) and the pull of suburban opportunities affect demographic residential patterns in the metro area.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Link between Segregation and Suburbanization\n\nPeople choose where they live based on the services they provide.\n\nhowever, not all residents are equally able to match these preferences with housing location\n\ncritique of Tiebout.\n\n\nThe rapid increase in the population of the suburbs during the postwar period was mostly not the result of white flight. Rather, rising incomes, low-cost, federally backed mortgages, the lucrative federal mortgage deduction, new housing construction in suburban tracts, and an extensive highway system all worked to bring residents to the periphery\n\"[T]he increased heterogeneity of suburbia as a whole is usually not matched by a greater diversification within particular suburbs. There are now more poor and working-class people, more minorities and more industrial and commercial sites in suburbia. But poorer, working-class or black suburbanites are likely to live in different jurisdictions separate from those inhabited by affluent or white suburbanites\"\nOvert racism has decreased dramatically over the last several decades (Schuman et al. Reference Schuman, Steeh and Bobo1997), but whites continue to express a preference for same-race neighbors (Charles Reference Charles2003) and minority neighborhoods continue to be perceived as having poor-quality amenities (Bobo, Kluegel, and Smith Reference Bobo, Kluegel, Smith, Tuch and Martin1997; Ellen Reference Ellen2000; Emerson, Chai, and Yancey Reference Emerson, Chai and Yancey2001; Krysan Reference Krysan2002; Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillian Reference Bayer, Ferreira and McMillan2007).\nWhy, even as neighborhoods have grown more integrated, have cities become less so? The answer is politics and political control.\nIf an individual holds negative stereotypes of racial minorities, she is likely to oppose government expenditures, especially when she believes that there is a racial disparity in who shoulders the tax burden and in who benefits from public services\nThis chapter shows that suburban sorting along race and class lines is linked to central city elections of minority mayors, larger city budgets, and a greater share of spending on police. It is also linked to greater use of land-use regulations in the suburbs and availability of suburban school districts.\n\n\n\nMeasuring Suburbanization: A New Approach\n\nMy argument is that city politics affects segregation patterns.\n\n\n\nSchools, Land-Use Regulation, and Suburban Segregation\n\nMetro areas with larger numbers of school districts allow residents more opportunity to jurisdiction shop, thereby increasing the potential for segregation across city lines.\nSuburban land-use controls and availability of school districts are significantly related to the degree to which segregation is accounted for across, rather than within, cities in metropolitan areas.\nThe data reveal that in metropolitan areas with more racial and renter segregation across cities – that is, where whites/nonwhites, renters, and owners tend to live in different municipalities – we see more heterogeneity in municipal budgets.\nWhen city policy does not favor the interests of white homeowners, these residents are more likely to trade homogenous neighborhoods within cities for new homogeneous cities instead.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9: The Polarized Nation That Segregation Built\n\nNeighborhoods that successfully defended their white homeowner turf, despite the massive demographic and policy transformations of the postwar period, became the locus of modern conservatism.\n\nargument made by suburban warriors.\n\nIn this chapter, I begin by linking white residential spaces in 1970 to three important neighborhood characteristics: property values, single-family homeownership, and the whiteness of public schools. Then, I provide evidence that the relative whiteness of a neighborhood in 1970 is a powerful predictor of political attitudes and loyalties today. People who live in places that were whiter than their metropolitan area was in 1970 were more likely to vote for the Republican presidential candidate in 2008 and are more conservative than their individual attributes (e.g., race, gender, marital status, age, education, income, presence of children) would otherwise predict.\n\n\nThe Effect of Context:\n\nWhy would living in a neighborhood that was white in 1970 affect political views in 2008?\n\nthe whiteness of a neighborhood could produce individual-level conservatism through two different mechanisms:\n\nnonrandom migration of individuals into or out of whiter neighborhoods (sorting/selection)\n\nconservative people moved to white neighborhoods.\n\nBill bishop argument.\n\n\nor by directly affecting the ideology of residents.\n\nParticular types of places can generate distinctive preferences as a result of features of the place, like population density or community size (Rodden Reference Rodden2011; Gainsborough Reference Gainsborough2001; Ogorzalek Reference Ogorzalek2018; Oliver Reference Oliver2001).\nThat is, if your neighborhood is very dense, you may be more inclined to see the need for rodent control or sewage treatment. Places can also magnify the individual attributes of inhabitants – such as when minority neighborhoods lack elite networks (Wilson Reference Wilson1987; Widestrom Reference Widestrom2015). Neighborhood homogeneity might breed racial hostility and intolerance due to a lack of exposure to or contact with neighbors of different backgrounds (Oliver and Mendelberg Reference Oliver and Mendelberg2000; Oliver and Wong Reference Oliver and Wong2003). Additionally, past political experiences can shape current views.\nPatterns of race relations developed during early periods of American history can generate opinions and behaviors that are transmitted over time and remain detectable in modern politics (Hersh and Nall Reference Hersh and Nall2016). Such distinctive political attitudes are communicated through processes like neighborhood social interaction (Huckfeldt and Sprague Reference Huckfeldt and Sprague1995) and/or \"low-intensity cues\" – such as the casual observation of ones' neighbors (Cho and Rudolph Reference Cho and Rudolph2008). More straightforwardly, it seems reasonable to suspect that moving to a neighborhood with high property values and good schools leads homeowners to become obsessively concerned with keeping those values high and the schools good.\n\n\nboth of these mechanisms are probably at play.\n\nWhat I demonstrate is that neighborhood traits from the 1970s are associated with conservatism at aggregate, and individual levels are above and beyond the mobility of the population and the demographic makeup of the neighborhood today.\n\n\n\nLinking Segregation and Conservatism\n\nTradition segregation was explicit\nLaws change.\n\nHomeowners will talk about increased traffic, limited open space, or a change in the feel of the neighborhood as reasons for their opposition to development. They'll talk about their right to protect their neighborhoods and their schools from increased crime, property degradation, or poor academic performance. But they do not, usually, say that they want to limit the presence of black, Latino, or poor neighbors.\n\nBecause the Republican Party protected defenders' rights to choose their neighbors, it won their allegiance.\nResidents who live in defended neighborhoods today are more likely to identify as Republicans and more likely to vote for Republican presidential candidates. The local roots of modern conservatism are deep.\n\nsee Lisa McGirr\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10: Concluding Thoughts and New Designs\n\nAs Peterson (Reference Peterson1981), explained, local politics is \"above all the politics of land use\" (p. 25).\nI argue that the policies that generate segregation and racial inequality are driven fundamentally by whites' economic and political self-interest, which both interact with and produce racist beliefs.\nSegregation by Design asserts that across time and place, white property owners have achieved power, access, and policy that is unrepresentative of their share of the population. They turn out to vote at higher rates and dominate decision-making bodies. As a result, political outcomes at the local level are not pluralistic.\nHigher levels of government have disrupted white property owners' power. Mobilization among people of color has limited their power too. Segregation by Design tells this story. Of course, there are still many unanswered questions. To start, this book has neglected to interrogate how property owners differ from one another across time and place, and has completely ignored the role and agency of property owners of color. What happens when neighborhood property owners conflict with residential developers? What determines who wins? We need to know how variation in goals and perspectives may affect land-use policy, segregation, and inequality.\nState and federal governments can compel desegregation on various fronts.\nThus, desegregating neighborhoods and schools is likely to require stripping, to some degree, local control. At a minimum, going forward, states could analyze school district and municipality incorporation with an eye toward integration, limiting fragmentation and opportunities for segregation. Importantly, states can also require the building of multifamily housing, although this latter solution may only serve to increase segregation within cities if exclusive suburbs shove multifamily housing into concentrated neighborhoods."

Sokhey. \"Discussion Networks, Issues, and Perceptions of Polarization in the American Electorate.\" Political Behavior, 39(4), 967-988.\n\nThoughts:\n\nThis is kinda the same paper/mechanism as Ahler but only they add a variable to include networks (aka Mutz)\nthis is core networks\n\nwhat about non-core networks?\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nDrawing on the sizable literature on polarization in the American public, we consider the link between discussion network composition and perceptions of polarization. Participants in the 2008–2009 ANES panel study were asked to complete an innovative battery; they interactively moved histograms to rate other groups' positions on several prominent issues. These novel exercises provide data on individuals' projections of the average attitudes of others, but critically, they also provide data on the variability of such attitudes. Thus, we use these \"response-distributions\" to thoroughly assess (1) the relationship between network characteristics and perceptions of the distance between party opinions, and (2) the relationship between network characteristics and perceptions of the homogeneity of opinions within parties. We find evidence that discussion networks track with individual perceptions of the parties in the electorate: exposure to interpersonal disagreement predicts the perception of less distance between (the mean opinions of) the parties, and the reporting of more heterogeneity of opinion within the parties. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for democratic functioning more generally.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\nAhler but with Mutz and network stuff.\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nDoes political information exposure in core networks influence perceptions of the electorate?\nHow do people perceive distributions of issue attitudes?\nIf Democrats and Republicans think they are further apart than they really are, what factors are responsible?\nFinally, if \"social distances\" between the parties are growing [and are independent of actual issue stances (Iyengar et al. 2012)], do such gaps condition views of group opinions?\nThe central question is not what drives people to believe that others share their views, but what drives their perceptions of extremity and homogeneity in others.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe tolerance perspective predicts that when exposed to disagreement, citizens will perceive less distance between the parties and/or more heterogeneity within them.\nThe social categorization perspective argues that disagreement may encourage individuals to see more homogeneity within partisan groups and/or greater distance between said groups.\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nMany scholars cede that regardless of whether opinions of Democrats and Republicans are actually drifting apart, Americans tend to think they are drifting apart\nPerceptions of polarization are important in their own right. If citizens view members of the out-party as more ideologically extreme or homogenous than they are, a host of democratic negatives may follow: people may be less likely to engage in disagreeable discussion in order to avoid conflict (that may not actually exist), and may falsely dismiss contrary perspectives as radical/extreme—in other words, the beneficial effects of discourse across lines of difference may be precluded (see, e.g., Mutz 2006).\nTaken together, the fact that elites are polarized, but that the views of the average citizen are potentially more nuanced (and differ based on affect vs. issue positions) raises questions: How do people perceive distributions of issue attitudes?\nWe focus on how social networks structure such evaluations to move beyond standard assessments of how individual attitudes drive perceptions (i.e., simple projection—Judd et al. 2012), or of how affect towards groups and candidates has changed; perceptions of the composition and distribution of beliefs in the electorate warrant additional attention.\nexposure to socially supplied distributions of opinions will color individuals' perceptions of opinion distributions in broader groups of Democrats and Republicans\n\n\n\nIndependent Variable\n\nNetwork Characteristics\n\nThe discussion network battery contains a political name generator in which respondents are asked to identify three discussants with whom they discuss politics, and are then asked to report on their characteristics\n\n\n\n\nDependent Variable:\n\nMean Distance and Standard Deviations:\n\nhow homogenous or heterogeneous they think that their and the opposing party's views are on an issue, and how far apart they believe the two parties are\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nWe find evidence that discussion networks track with individual perceptions of the parties in the electorate: exposure to interpersonal disagreement predicts the perception of less distance between (the mean opinions of) the parties, and the reporting of more heterogeneity of opinion within the parties.\nExposure to disagreement serves to reduce differences between the two parties in the electorate; discussing politics with those who hold different beliefs affects perceptions of polarization by encouraging individuals to see less distance between the average opinions in the parties, but also more heterogeneity of opinion within them.\nFinally, some have argued that a different kind of selection is now at work—that Americans are exposed to dissonant perspectives less and less frequently in day to day life as our society becomes more spatially polarized (e.g., Bishop 2008); this has been pinned to increasing ideological polarization (as people are not afforded the opportunity to understand out-party views). We are not able to weigh in on the sorting debate, and we do not examine the extent to which exposure to disagreement influences actual opinion polarization (we limit our focus to perceptions). However, as our results suggest that exposure to political difference may reduce perceptions of polarization, we would again emphasize a cautiously optimistic tone. Even if people are moving to more politically homogeneous areas, since individuals are often unable to avoid all interpersonal disagreement, there may be reason to suspect that networks could help remedy some of the more deleterious consequences of geographic polarization. We encourage scholars to conduct additional research on the social roots of polarization perceptions so that more definitive conclusions can be reached, and more certain assessments given to this aspect of democratic health."

Research has illuminated the personal calculus of voting, but the social calculus has received little attention since the 1940s. This study expands our understanding of the social influences on individual choice by examining the relationship of partisan biases in media, organizational, and interpersonal intermediaries to the voting choices of Americans. Its results show that the traditional sources of social influence still dominate: Interpersonal discussion outweighs the media in affecting the vote. Media effects appear to be the product of newspaper editorial pages rather than television or newspaper reporting, which contain so little perceptible bias that they often are misperceived as hostile. Parties and secondary organizations also are influential, but only for less interested voters—who are more affected by social contexts in general. Overall, this study demonstrates that democratic citizens are embedded in social contexts that join with personal traits in shaping their voting decisions.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nThe primary sources of these cues are personal networks and groups, not the modern mass media, which has often been ceded greater electoral significance. Second, these partisan cues have a direct influence on voting behavior. To be sure, personal characteristics are key factors in voting: partisanship, ideologies, and fixed personal characteristics play powerful roles in determining the vote. Our evidence indicates, however, that these personal forces are only part of the voting calculus.\n\n\nResearch Questions:\n\nHow are political choices shaped by a decision maker’s immediate social and informational context?\nWhat candidates did the intermediaries to which voters were exposed in the 1992 presidential election campaign favor?\nWhat was the relationship between the biases of their intermediaries and voters’ choices in 1992?\nOur ultimate question is whether partisan biases in voters’ information sources influence their vote choices\n\n\n\nHypothesis/Argument:\n\nBy relying on one information source rather than another, citizens are more or less likely to encounter information that encourages some choices and outcomes while it discourages others.\nIf the flow of information coming to voters is skewed in favor of one candidate over another, we hypothesize that this will influence their electoral decisions, even after their own partisan orientations and other enduring personal influences on the vote are taken into account.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nThere is a cognitive capacity that varies and can be overwhelmed.\nShift away from voting as a product of “personal” to “social” calculus.\nThere are a lot of different ways to get information now than in 1940 (Lazarsfeld time).\nTV has changed everything.\nMessage sent \\(\\neq\\) message received.\n\nhard to test how people take cues from who if there are so many different ways.\n\npeople can also selectively perceive the messages that are sent.\nShould bias be measured at the source or at the receiver?\n\nauthors argue better to look at receiver.\n\nbut is still not perfect.\n\nAuthors re-argue we should just know both\n\n\n\nInterpersonal discussion networks are important influences on political behavior - Huckfeldt.\nGranovetter pops up again.\n\nimportance of weak ties!\n\nbecause of this, we need to look beyond the most intimate discussants.\n\n\nThey are arguing media is unbiased….lol\nPartisans in our data were more likely to perceive their newspaper and television news as biased in favor of the candidate of the other party\nexposure is a necessary ingredient for influence.\n“Personal discussants enjoy the advantage of having close and continuing relationships with the voter. No other intermediary can match the level of attention that discussants’ political messages receive.”\n\nidk if this is still the case anymore.\n\nZaller’s (1992) theory predicts that the influence of messages received from intermediaries will grow as political awareness declines, at least as long as the person is exposed to political messages. While inattentiveness makes reception of political messages less likely, once they are received people with little political information find them difficult to resist.\n\n-   This leaves less informed voters more open to influence by short-term considerations and other forces---including, perhaps, their immediate social context.\n\nBased on these results, one can conclude that the social context is more important for less politicized than for more politicized members of the American electorate.\nRather, voters’ enduring personal characteristics interact with the messages they are receiving from the established social context in which they operate.\n\n\n\nData:\n\n1992 presidential election in the US.\nFive nation Cross-National Election Project (CNEP)\ntelephone survey of the american electorate\n\nn=1318\n\ncluster this sample in 39 counties.\n\n\nthen did a snowball sample of discussants mentioned by the respondents in our main survey.\n\nstudy personal discussion networks. l\n\nAlso coded news reports and editorials in the major daily newspaper read by county residents for a sample of days during the election campaign.\nFourth, we conducted content analysis of the national network news programs during the same period.\nFifth, in each county they surveyed county party and presidential organizations on their activities during the campaign.\nrespondents were asked to report which candidate each of up to five discussants supported in the 1992 election\n\nthe first four were to be discussants “with whom they discussed important matters”\n\nthe fifth named discussants was prompted to be an explicitly political discussant who was not already mentioned\n\n60% of sample added a fifth.\n\nonly a slight majority of them were relatives.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, about 30% of Americans in 1992 were not located in a discussion context noticeably favorable to a single candidate. This is a substantial share of the electorate to lack partisan anchoring through personal networks—more than found in the early Columbia studies\nFig1 contains survey respondents perceptions of which candidate was favored by the principal newspaper they read and by the television network newscast they watched the most.\nOur survey asked respondents about their membership in up to three organizations, including whether each supported a candidate in the election. The number of specific organizations named was very large, precluding direct measurement of each organization’s partisan preferences, so we rely entirely upon perceptions of organizational bias.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nabout 30% of Americans in 1992 were not located in a discussion context noticeably favorable to a single candidate. This is a substantial share of the electorate to lack partisan anchoring through personal networks—more than found in the early Columbia studies\nPartisans in our data were more likely to perceive their newspaper and television news as biased in favor of the candidate of the other party\nCompared to discussion networks, then, the media were considerably less likely to be sources of partisan-biased information during the 1992 presidential election campaign. They were less partisan overall, and their partisanship was inconsistent across their stories.\nThe data on organizations tell a story of little organizational bias overall, but it generally favors the Democrats where it does appear. America is a nation of joiners, and 85% of the sample reported membership in at least one organization. The organizations Americans join are overwhelmingly nonpolitical, however; fewer than one-quarter of the respondents claimed that an organization to which they belonged supported one of the presidential candidates.\nPersonal discussants:\n\nIn each case, the candidate favored by the discussion network is advantaged. Of the two measures, perceived discussant preferences consistently turn out to be more important than actual discussant preferences, but each adds significantly to the account.\n\nRepublicans single out television as more “hostile” medium than newspapers.\nParty activity had a limited relationship to voting in 1992.\nCounty partisan context is null\n\ncounty is too big of a geographical unit.\n\nThe partisan cues of personal discussants, newspaper editorials, and secondary organizations seem most influential in presidential vote choices in 1992."

Howell. 2007. \"Accountability and Local Elections: Rethinking Retrospective Voting.\" Journal of Politics. 69(3): 844-858.\n\nAbstract:\nFor too long, research on retrospective voting has fixated on how economic trends affect incumbents’ electoral prospects in national and state elections. Hundreds of thousands of elections in the United States occur at the local level and have little to do with unemployment or inflation rates. This paper focuses on the most prevalent: school boards. Specifically, it examines whether voters hold school board members accountable for the performance of their schools. The 2000 elections reveal considerable evidence that voters evaluate school board members on the basis of student learning trends. During the 2002 and 2004 school board elections, however, when media (and by extension public) attention to testing and accountability systems drifted, measures of achievement did not influence incumbents’ electoral fortunes. These findings, we suggest, raise important questions about both the scope conditions of retrospective voting models and the information voters rely upon when evaluating incumbents.\n\n\nBumper Sticker\n\n\nResearch Questions:\n\nDo voters reward elected officials for a job well done?\nDo voters’ ballot selections primarily reflect other considerations that have little to do with an incumbent’s performance in office?\nDo average voters hold school board members accountable for the performance of their schools?\nDo voters punish or reward incumbent school board members on the basis of changes in student learning in local and district schools?\nWhat exactly do they hold them accountable for?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe prevalence of retrospective voting in local elections, we suggest, critically depends upon the volume, tone, and sources of information that voters have about recent changes in the relevant domains of public life.\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nRetrospective voting: the proposition that citizens examine whether the state of the world has improved under a politician’s watch, and vote accordingly.\nLocal gov officials usually overlooked.\nLiterature on retrospective voting supposes that a voter’s decision to support or oppose an incumbet’s reelection efforts ultimately rides upon recent changes in inflation and unemployment rates.\n\n\nWhether to Hold Incumbents Accountable?\n\nKey really kicks off this literature.\nretrospective seems to be somewhat common.\nNational/state elections have good evidence for retrospective but are sparse on local.\n\nKaufman (2004) finds that racial politics usually trump retrospective evaluations of incumbent performance in mayoral elections in major U.S. cities\n\nthis is interesting.\n\nwonder how DEI at school board is the racial element weaponized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Hold Incumbents Accountable for?\n\nschool-board members have some direct influence on school performance.\nI am wondering about the size of the school-board. Thinking about Oliver and polycentrism here.\n\n\n\nRetrospective Voting in School Board Elections\n\ntwo institutional features of local elections enhance the general possibility that voters will hold school board members responsible for the performance of local schools\n\nmembers’ job responsibilities are reasonably well defined, which simplifies the task of evaluating their performances in office.\nSecond, because most board elections are nonpartisan, party identification does not rival retrospective evaluations of incumbents as a basis for voting behavior.\n\nRetrospective depends on the amount and type of info that voters have about the incumbents’ performances in office.\nIn the context of school board elections, there are often measures of trends in the school.\ncoverage of school boards is uneven and episodic.\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\n31414 school and district-level achievement trends and precint- and district-lvel voting returns in 499 races over three electoral cycles in South Carolina.\n85 districts.\n\nhalf hold school board elections in any two-year election cylce.\nprecint-level election returns for all school board races and the computed the vote share for each incumbent running in a competitive election.\n\nstudent achievement data\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nWith average incumbent vote share at 58%, these estimates suggest that a major swing in test scores can erode as much as two-fifths of an incumbets margin of victory.\ndistrict-level scores were not significant, suggesting that voters focused on school performance within their immediate neighborhood rather than across the broader district.\nIn models that include both districtand precinct-level scores (not shown), we again find that only precinct-level scores have a significant relationship with vote share.\ntest score changes continue to attain statistical significance and remain in the expected direction: incumbents appear disinclined to seek reelection when their district’s test scores drop.\nThe point estimates from column 2 suggest that a movement from the 75th to the 25th percentile in test score change is associated with an 18 percentage point increase in the probability of facing a challenger\nThe evidence from South Carolina suggests that voters, at least some of the time, do acquire the information required to vote retrospectively in school board elections. Unfortunately, though, we do not observe the actual source of that information.\nSuppose, first, that voters rely upon mediated sources of information. To explain the findings we observe,it must be the case that the amount and/or type of media coverage granted to student test scores differed markedly across the three electoral cycles. In fact, we find considerable evidence that it did."

    "text": "Hillygus, D.S. 2010. \"Campaign Effects on Vote Choice.\" In The Oxford Handbook of American Elections and Political Behavior. J. Leighley, ed. Oxford UP.*\n\nAbstract:\nThis article describes how far the literature of campaign effects on vote choice has come, and where it should go. It seems clear that the effects of campaigns are more constrained than often is presented in the media. Moreover, the state of research regarding theinfluence of campaigns on vote choice (rather than turnout), including campaign effects due to citizen learning, campaign priming, and, more directly, voter persuasion, is discussed. The recent evidence of campaign effects largely reflects the availability of better data and more sophisticated research designs. In addition to individual-levelvariation in the way voters process campaign information, there is also variation in theparticular campaign messages they receive. The great variation in candidate strategy and voter decision making should be viewed as both an opportunity and challenge for campaign scholars.\n\n\nArgument/Point of Article:\n\nLiterature Review\n“Scholars should move beyond trying to estimate the effect of campaigns, and instead should study for whom, when, and in what ways campaigns matter.”\nWhat is the influence of campaigns on vote choice, citizen learning, campaign priming, and, more directly, voter persuasion?\n\n\n\nLiterature Review (intro):\n\ndebate about campaign effect.\n\nno longer a consensus of minimal campaign effects.\n\nIn a context in which Hitler had risen to power amidst an unprecedented propaganda campaign and an Orson Welles radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds had created mass panic, Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues were concerned that campaigns could manipulate the public.\n\nCambell argues its more of long-term characterisitcs about an individual\n\nColumbia school did offer evidence that campaigns can change the relative weight of some considerations.\n\npriming effect.\n\ncampaigns make things salient.\n\ncampaigns are important primarily because they activate latent predispositions.\n\n\n\ncampaigns offer a mobilization effect - Nie, Verba, Petrocik\n\n\nThe “Minimal Effects” Perspective\n\nPolitical scientists were able to develop the “fundamentals” (economic conditions and presidential approval) that would do a pretty good job at predicting who would win.\nCampaigns are minimal because they nullify each other.\n\ncandidates have similar skill and money.\n\nCampaigns provide voters with information to help activate their predispostion (Gelman and King)\n\n\n\nLearning\n\ncampaigns increase voters’ knowledge of candidates and issues.\ninterpersonal discussions (Beck et al. 2002)\n\nread earlier.\n\nWhat source of information produces the greatest learning effects?\n\nno real way to test/know this.\n\nMarkus Prior:\n\nthe expansion of media choice has exacerbated the knowledge gap in the electorate. The information age enables political junkies to follow the politicalworld more closely than ever before, but it also allows others to avoid it altogether\n\n\n\n\nPriming:\n\npriming - changing the weight voters attach to different considerations.\nstrong support for campaign’s effect in priming.\nCampaigns may help remind people of their party affiliation\n\nothers find ideology or issues more likely to be activated than partisanship.\n\npriming brings issues to the top of the head - more easily accessible cognitively\n\nZaller argument.\n\n\n\n\nPersuasion:\n\nThe question of whether campaigns persuade is normative the most important and interesting!\n\nhard to measure!\n\nPersuasion: any campaign-induced changes in the attitudes or considerations that underlie the vote decision.\nthe wayward partisan who returns home in response to the party conventions might be considered evidence of campaign persuasion.\nCampaigns do not typically get individuals to vote against their predispositions, but they do help voters sort through diverse and conflicting predispositions, shaping which onesvoters bring to bear in selecting a preferred candidate\n\nThis means, then, that learning and priming could be the mechanisms by which individualsmight change their vote choice\n\nDebate about the effect of persuasion\n\nconvention and debates can have a persuasion effect\ntelevision ad can too\n\nstill don’t really know.\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement and Analysis of Campaign Effects\n\nNew understandings of campaigns with new data.\nInnovations in field experiments andsurvey experiments have allowed for cleaner assessments of voter exposure to andreaction to campaign activities.\n\n\n\nToward a New Study of Campaign Effects\n\nWe need to step back to consider the reciprocal flow of influence between candidates and voters in a political campaign.\n\nAnd we should start with clearer expectations about the decision‐making process of both candidates and voters in a political campaign.\n\nRather, for any campaign effect—especially persuasion—we should expect that it may be larger or smaller depending on characteristics of thecampaign information and characteristics of the respondent\n\n\n\nHeterogeneity in Voter Decision Making\n\nWe should think of voter decision making as a dynamic process in which voters have a set of predispositions—existing beliefs, attitudes, interests, and attachments—and they are charged with the task of matching those predispositions with a candidateselection.\nAnd Zaller (1992) and Converse (1964), of course, arguethat those with mid‐levels of sophistication are most likely to change their mind inresponse to new information.\npartisan activation might be the main goal of the campaign.\n\npartisans are more influenced by campaign effects\n\n\n\n\nHeterogeneity in Campaign Messages\n\nThe volume and content of campaign messages will differ acrossgeographic areas, communication modes, and different households.\nWho are campaigns targeting?\n\ndebated a lot.\nwho is receiving the message?\n\nDemocrats should focus on the issues onwhich their party has a strong performance record—education, health care, and socialsecurity, while Republicans should focus on the issues they \"own\"—taxes,national security, crime. Yet, recent research has challenged the idea that candidates areactually following such a strategy (Kaplan, Park, and Ridout 2006; Sides2006). And, of course, the content of the message is not likely to be static, it will likely change as thecandidates react to each other, polls, media, and the broader environment—anothersource of variation that has rarely been accounted for in academic research."

I determine social group memberships significantly influence individual partisanship with a multivariate analysis using 56 years of ANES data. I then measure how many votes each politically relevant social group contributed to the party coalitions in each presidential election from 1952 to 2008. I discuss how group contributions have changed over time and establish the demographic and behavioral causes of group contribution change. I find that the party coalitions have been restructured as a result of groups’ changing voting behavior and the changing ratio of groups in the electorate.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nGroup membership -&gt; party affiliation\n\nWhat groups makeup the parties?\n\n\n\nResearch Questions:\n\nHow have the parties’ social base changed over time?\nWhat social group memberships actually structure individual level voting behavior?\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nDescriptive paper\nOnly focused on group membership that is politically relevant.\n\npolitically relevant groups as those group memberships that are statistically significant predictors of partisan identification, while groups that are not reference points have an effect that is statistically indistinguishable from zero.\n\nusing vote choice instead of partisanship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe size of a group’s contribution to a party’s coalition is a product of three factors:\n\nLoyalty—the proportion of group members that support the party\nTurnout—the proportion of group members that actually vote\nSize—the group’s proportion of the total population\n\nI wonder how much of this is driven by certain group membership disappearing\n\nunion membership is declining.\n\n\n\n\nExploring the sources of group contribution change\n\nThere are three reasons why a group’s contribution could change over time:\n\nConversion —A group’s loyalty to a party increases or decreases\nMobilization—A group’s rate of turnout increases or decreases\nDemographic Change—There are more or less voters in the group as a proportion of the total population compared to previous elections\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nSome group memberships have a consistent and significant effect on vote choice across all (or nearly all) decades including—African Americans, Latinos, Jews, union members, whites, Protestants and Catholics.\nThe effect of some group memberships moves in a consistent direction over time as the group becomes consistently more Democratic or Republican. These groups include—white Southerners, the non-religious, weekly church attendees, college graduates, men and women.\nOther group memberships never have a consistently significant effect on vote choice across all decades including—age group, birth cohorts, income category, urbanism and Asian."

In fact, we find that higher-income voters are more inclined to rely on issues (economic and moral) in making their voting decisions."

    "text": "Kraft, P, M. Lodge, and C. Taber. 2015. \"Why People 'Don't Trust the Evidence':Motivated Reasoning and Scientific Beliefs.\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science\n\nAbstract:\nIn this commentary, we embed the volume's contributions on public beliefs about science in a broader theoretical discussion of motivated political reasoning. The studies presented in the preceding section of the volume consistently find evidence for hyperskepticism toward scientific evidence among ideologues, no matter the domain or context—and this skepticism seems to be stronger among conservatives than liberals. Here, we show that these patterns can be understood as part of a general tendency among individuals to defend their prior attitudes and actively challenge attitudinally incongruent arguments, a tendency that appears to be evident among liberals and conservatives alike. We integrate the empirical results reported in this volume into a broader theoretical discussion of the John Q. Public model of information processing and motivated reasoning, which posits that both affective and cognitive reactions to events are triggered unconsciously. We find that the work in this volume is largely consistent with our theories of affect-driven motivated reasoning and biased attitude formation.\n\n\nLiterature Review/Argument:\n\nScientific debates should be independent of partisan considerations.\nindividuals employ more skepticism toward scientific evidence as ideologies\n\nmainly conservatives.\n\nThere is a general tendency among individuals to defend their prior attitudes and actively challenge attitudinally inconvenient arguments.\n\n\nPolitical Beliefs and Scientific Skepticism:\n\nBlank and Shaw find that when scientific results conflict with a readily available alternative view, individuals are less likely to defer to the research.\n\nnot just ideology and religiosity but also partisan identification!\n\nSchuldt, Roh, and Schwarz show that partisan divide is contingent on questionnaire design, including wording and order effects.\n\nbig difference in response between “climate change” and “global warming”.\n\ndifferent findings point to two different explanations:\n\npartisan differences toward science may be driven by alternative beliefs and motivations individuals hold that\nOr individual response patters are contingent on contextual informational frames.\n\nthe effect of framing is best understood if one takes into account the motivational processes engaged as people evaluate policy proposals.\n\nkinda a frank luntz argument here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting Affect First: Motivated Reasoning and the John Q. Public Model:\n\nIndividuals do not accept and internalize informational and contextual frames irrespective of their predispositions.\nJohn Q. Public model claims that these biases, and information processing in general, are driven by initial affect.\n\nthe fundamental assumption driving our model is that both affective and cognitive reactions to external and internal events are triggered unconsciously, followed spontaenously by the activation of associateive pathways that link thoughts to feelings to intentions to behavior, so that very early events, even those that occur below conscious awareness, set the direction for all subsequent processing.\n\nall thinking is suffused with feeling and these feelings arise automatically within a few milliseconds of exposure to a sociopolitical object or event.\nspreading activation hypothesis\n\nactivation from priors and incidental affect will spread along well-traveled “hot” associative pathways that link things together.\n\nevidence is accumulating that attitudes and behavior arise from automatic, uncontrolled processes and are often set before we begin seriously \"thinking\" about them. If this is the case, deliberation serves to rationalize rather than cause our thinking, reasoning, and intentions.\ndeliberation is a product of unconsciously determined, affectively driven processes.\nHow can the model described above account for the empirical findings on science denial?\n\nhot cognition hypothesis: JQP posits that all social objects and concepts for which prior attitudes exist are affectively charged. Initial affective responses to a stimulus enter the decision stream before any and all conscious deliberations and thereby influence all down-streaming processes, such as the activation of certain considerations in memory, or related judgements and evaluations.\n\nhow does that affect form? is it elite driven? Experience driven? Do we care? The affect arises if it is familiar or triggers those “hot pathways”.\n\n\nglobal warming and climate change have greater affective charge for republicans than democrats.\nHowever, the model presented in this commentary does not claim that individuals never revise their initial attitudes or are unable to overcome their initial affects, but JQP does suggest that persuasion is difficult and certainly more effortful than following the powerful affective currents down the stream of processing.\novercoming this is difficult and as long as political elites align the debates along partisan lines rather than emphasizing the necessity of a common understand of the underlying issues."

    "text": "Jerit, J and Yangzi Zhao. 2020. Political Misinformation. Annual Reviews.\n\nAbstract:\nMisinformation occurs when people hold incorrect factual beliefs and do so confidently. The problem, first conceptualized by Kuklinski and colleagues in 2000, plagues political systems and is exceedingly difficult to correct. In this review, we assess the empirical literature on political misinformation in the United States and consider what scholars have learned since the publication of that early study. We conclude that research on this topic has developed unevenly. Over time, scholars have elaborated on the psychological origins of political misinformation, and this work has cumulated in a productive way. By contrast, although there is an extensive body of research on how to correct misinformation, this literature is less coherent in its recommendations. Finally, a nascent line of research asks whether people’s reports of their factual beliefs are genuine or are instead a form of partisan cheerleading. Overall, scholarly research on political misinformation illustrates the many challenges inherent in representative democracy.\n\n\nBackground/Lit Review:\n\nMisinformation: when people hold incorrect factual beliefs and do so confidently.\nKulinski et al. (2000) is the big unconditional text for this lit.\nmisinformed people base their political opinions on inaccurate beliefs\n\nthink about lau and redlawsk here\n\nMisinformation \\(\\neq\\) belief in rumors and conspiratorial thinking\n\nrumors are statements that lack specific standards of evidence but gain credibility through widespread social transmission.\nconspiratorial thinking explain political or historical events through references to “the machinations of powerful people”\n\nFocus is on misinformation as defined as: incorrect, but confidently held, political beliefs.\n\n\n\nWhat Causes Political Misinformation?\n\nDifferent types of psychological motives\n\naccuracy motive: a desire to make the correct decision.\ndirectional motives: the desire to arrive at a specific conclusion, one that maintains consistency with one’s attitudes.\n\nindividuals use both of these but it varies based on context.\n\n\nparties impart strong direction goals\ntension between accuracy and directional\n\nJQP model: all objects we encounter as part of our daily life are infused with affect, with positive feelings for liking and negative feelings for disliking.\n\npeoples processing goals change across situations.\n\n\n\nOvercoming Misinformation Through Correction:\n\nCorrection should be difficult because people cling to misinformation for both motivational and cognitive reasons.\n\nmotivational basis if it stems from a person’s desire to arrive at a specific conclusion\nmay also be cognitivie and easily retrievable in memory.\n\nCorrecting methods?\n\nalternative factual account is effective\ncredibility of source.\nAlso, it is paramount that corrective efforts not boost the familiarity of misinformation.\n\n“Obama is not a Muslim”\n\nno good/effective correction.\n\nprocessing goals also influence corrective efforts.\nSo under what conditions will correction be successful for misinformation?\n\ntwo factors\n\nissue type\nsource of corrective message\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of Issue Type\n\nOn issues or topics that are closely connected to one’s partisan/ideological identity, one will be motivated to process information in a way that preserves those attachments.\nCorrections will be more successful when accepting the retraction does not threaten a person’s worldview or a cherished attitude.\n\n\n\nThe Source of the Corrective Message\n\nin addition to the topics, the source is important for correction.\nBerinsky (2017) found that a corrective message about ACA death panels is most effective at changing beliefs when it is attributed to a Republican compared to either a Democrat or a nonpartisan source.\nIn the case of the Berinsky and Bode & Vraga studies, the corrective messages were effective precisely because the threat to a person’s ideological commitments was reduced or absent (\n\n\n\nRemaining Gaps in the Literature\n\ndo we measure or manipulate misnformation?\nit remains hotly debated whether failed correction—and especially backfire effects— are asymmetric across liberals and conservatives.\nit is notoriously difficult to identify the standard for a successful correction, particularly when the dependent variable is an attitude.\n\n\n\nLesson from Pyschology\n\nInvalidated information is not simply deleted from memory because memory does not work like a whiteboard, and retractions do not simply erase misinformation.\nContinued influence Effect: CIE arises from cognitive mechanisms that allow false information to influence the reasoning process even after that information has been discredited.\n\n\n\nMeasurement: Confidently Wrong or Expressive Responding?\n\nThe more inaccurate people’s beliefs about welfare, the more certain they felt about being correct.\nRegular inclusion of confidence-in-knowledge measures would both improve the classification of these items (e.g., ignorance versus misinformation) and increase our ability to generalize across studies\n\nthis might have been good with barber and pope. Not sure what im getting at but I feel there is something I am circling around here.\n\nExpressive responding is thought to occur when there is a difference between the response formed by a respondent (their true belief) and the one they report in a survey.\nThe question of whether mistaken factual beliefs are genuine or whether some statements of belief are a product of partisan cheerleading is crucial to address because the answer has implications for the solutions that scholars devise."

    "text": "Enders et al. 2022. \"Are Republicans and Conservatives More Likely to Believe Conspiracy Theories?\" Political Behavior\n\nAbstract:\nA sizable literature tracing back to Richard Hofstadter's The Paranoid Style (1964) argues that Republicans and conservatives are more likely to believe conspiracy theories than Democrats and liberals. However, the evidence for this proposition is mixed. Since conspiracy theory beliefs are associated with dangerous orientations and behaviors, it is imperative that social scientists better understand the connection between conspiracy theories and political orientations. Employing 20 surveys of Americans from 2012 to 2021 (total n = 37,776), as well as surveys of 20 additional countries spanning six continents (total n = 26,416), we undertake an expansive investigation of the asymmetry thesis. First, we examine the relationship between beliefs in 52 conspiracy theories and both partisanship and ideology in the U.S.; this analysis is buttressed by an examination of beliefs in 11 conspiracy theories across 20 more countries. In our second test, we hold constant the content of the conspiracy theories investigated—manipulating only the partisanship of the theorized villains—to decipher whether those on the left or right are more likely to accuse political out-groups of conspiring. Finally, we inspect correlations between political orientations and the general predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories over the span of a decade. In no instance do we observe systematic evidence of a political asymmetry. Instead, the strength and direction of the relationship between political orientations and conspiricism is dependent on the characteristics of the specific conspiracy beliefs employed by researchers and the socio-political context in which those ideas are considered.\n\n\nBumper Sticker\nConspiratorial symmetry.\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nIs there evidence for the asymmetry theory in conspiracy beliefs.\nAre those on the political right more likely than those on the left to believe in conspiracy theories?\nDoes the relative size of the relationship between motivated conspiracy theory endorsement and political orientations vary depending on whether the purported conspirators are Democrats or Republicans?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nWe argue that contradictory findings are the result of researchers’ choices and assumptions.\nThere are inconsistent findings across this literature\n\nwe posit that inconsistencies across findings are partially due to the concept of conspiracy theory itself.\n\n\n\n\nBackground/Theory:\n\nHofstadter argues that REpublicans and conservatives are more likely to believe conspiracy theories than Democrats and liberals.\nSomething to note: there is a large qualitative difference across conspiracies. The conspiracies that republicans may believe in are not necessarilly or should be compared at the same level as democrat conspiracy theories.\nA conspiracy theory is an explanation of an event or circumstnace that accueses powerful actors of working in secret for their own benefit, against the common good, and in a way that undermiens bedrock societal norms, rules, or laws.\nbelief in conspiracy theories are often a reaction to elite political discourse.\nGiven that elite cues and motivated reasoning appear to similarly affect both Republicans/conservatives and Democrats/liberals\nThe last five years have witnessed Republican elites in government and media (most notably Donald Trump) utilizing conspiracy theories in a way unprecedented in the last half century of American politics, and with severe, deleterious consequences for democratic institutions. This alone has encouraged renewed conjecture about an asymmetry in conspiracy theory beliefs. However, elites are an imperfect reflection of the public—-they have different goals, incentives, and knowledge about politics. Moreover, elite rhetoric rarely changes predispositions, such as conspiracy thinking, so much as it activates predispositions and connects them to salient political choices (Leeper & Slothuus, 2014). In other words, while Republican elites may have recently activated conspiratorial predispositions among supporters in the mass public—-where they exist—-in a way that Democratic elites did not, they are unlikely to be able to cause once non-conspiratorial supporters to become highly conspiratorial.\nWe encourage future work to integrate the conspiratorial rhetoric of elites with studies of mass beliefs and investigate elite conspiratorial rhetoric from actors including and beyond Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nFinding 1: The Relationship between Conspiracy Theory Beliefs and Political Orientations Depends on the Conspiracy Theory\n\nThere is political balance in belief of conspiracy theories\nThey add a fake conspiracy theory to see if Republicans would believe in it despite it being completely made up\n\nthis is the treatment basically.\n\nlots of variability across countries.\nThe relationship between political ideology and conspiracy theory beliefs appears to be dependent on both the details of the conspiracy theories and socio-political context.\nFurthermore, even though Finding 1 involves more conspiracy theory beliefs than previous studies, our findings remain an artifact of which conspiracy theories researchers investigate because there is no \"correct\" or \"representative\" set of conspiracy theories that researchers should employ.\n\n\n\nFinding 2: The Political Left and Right Both Accuse the Out-Party of Conspiring\n\nSurvey experiment\ntesting motivated reasoning.\nKeeping conspiracy theory constant and then varying the party identification of the conspirator beliefs.\nwe expect that Republican/conservative respondents would be more likely to endorse the \"Democrats are conspirators\" version of the questions\n\nvice versa\n\nA similar pattern emerges for ideology. In four of the 10 tests, the correlations are not statistically significantly different from one another. In the remaining six, liberals engage in greater motivated conspiracy theory endorsement than conservatives.\nwe find no support for the hypothesis that those on the right are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories that impugn liberals than liberals are to endorse the exact same conspiracy theories when they impugn conservatives.\n\n\n\nFinding 3: Conspiracy Thinking is Unsystematically Related to Political Orientations\n\nfocus on general predisposition to engage in conspiracy theorizing.\n4 item conspiracy thinking scale\nWe found only mixed evidence for the proposition that strong partisans or extreme ideological identifiers exhibit higher levels of conspiracy theorizing than weak identifiers or moderates/independents\n\n\n\nResults\n\nAcross multiple surveys and measurement strategies, we found more evidence for partisan and ideological symmetry in conspiricism, however operationalized, than for asymmetry.\nBy fusing social media data with survey data researchers can gain greater leverage over questions about the conditions under which online behaviors are reflective of, or even impact, beliefs and offline behaviors."

    "text": "ANECDOTE PARAGRAPH\nA healthy democracy requires a politically active and engaged mass.\nQuestions about why some voters turnout and others do not have been tested and theorized at length. Socioeconomic status can increase or decrease turnout. Population density can dampen political participation in local elections.\n.Despite this vast literature, we still know very little about how physical space-the built environment-can shape political behaviors.\nThe built environment is a concept heavily studied within the fields of urban planning and public health. The built environment is defined as the man-made structures, features, and facilities viewed collectively as an environment in which people live and work (Lawrence and Low 1990). Studies of the built environment struggle due to measurement issues and differences. We choose to operationalize the built environment by using a measure of walkability. Walkability is closely related concept but is defined as the east of walking to amenities within a given area. We use our measure of walkability to study voter turnout in the 25 most populated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA). Previous studies of the built environment and political phenomenon have varied in their measurements and use surveys/case studies to study the effect on political participation. We provide the first known systematic national study of the built environment on political participation. To measure voter turnout, we use the L2 voter file aggregated to the Census block group level. We find a significantly positive association between walkability and voter turnout. We then field a survey to better understand what underlying mechanisms drive this association.\nOur results motivate greater attention to the relationship between the built environment and political phenomenon. The design of physical space has been rarely considered on political behavior. Because physical space structures how people interact and engage socially, how its’ design varies can lead to different political behaviors. In addition, its’ design is a collection of social choices made over time. By understanding how the built environment structures social interaction and thus political behaviors, we can better shape its formation to improve political outcomes more conducive to a healthy and equitable democracy."

We calculate this by taking the number of voters who turned out in an election divided by the number of registered voters in a Census block group. Summary statistics for general election voter turnout can be found in Table 2. Turnout data is sourced using the L2 voter file accessed through the Redistricting Data Hub, a nonprofit that purchased the file for use towards research on gerrymandering.\nTurnout data is available for earlier elections cycles. However, we choose to focus only on turnout in the 2016, 2018, and 2020 election cycles. Because the walkability measure is time invariant and is only measured at the time of its creation in 2018, we limit our scope to only these three election years. Given the built environment is a culmination of buildings constructed over many years, and typical construction of a building can take anywhere from 6 to 17+ months (Statista 2025), the change in walkability is likely negligible between the periods observed. We feel less confident with this assumption as we extend the election periods to before 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.
