We have some dataset where the mean is 50. Now let’s say one of our observations is 38. 38-50 = -12. See what happens!? We have a negative number. All observations to the left of our mean are negative while all observations to the right of our mean are positive.\n\nWhen we add these all up without the square term, we get ZERO!\n\nThus we square to accommodate for these canceling out.\n\nThere are other reasons we square but they aren’t relevant here and this is the main reason.\n\n\n\nNow the \\(n-1\\)\n\nN represents the number of observations.\n\nWhy are we subtracting it by 1?\n\nIf we were calculating the population variance, then we wouldn’t subtract by 1. However, we are pretty much never working with the population. We are always using some samples. \nThis part is not super intuitive. BUT, we are using the sample mean, NOT the population mean to calculate the variance.\n\nWe don’t know what the “true” population mean is. We have an estimate of it using our sample. Thus, there is some uncertainty around the sample mean (we don’t know if the sample mean is = to the population mean). To account for this uncertainty we add a -1 to our denominator. \n\nBy subtracting 1 from the denominator this makes the spread a little larger to account for that uncertainty. Think about what happens when we make our denominator smaller compared to if we don’t. Example:\n\n\\(\\frac{16}{4-1}\\) vs. \\(\\frac{16}{4}\\)\n\nthe one with the \\(4-1\\) denominator will have a larger output and thus account for the uncertainty in our measurement."

(multiple)\n\nWhat is confusing is that we can get standard error from one single measurement, even though it describes the means from multiple sets. Thus, even if you only have a single set of measurements, you are often given the option to plot the standard error.\n\nJust watch the damn video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A82brFpdr9g\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we take the square root of observations in the denominator? \n\nBy dividing by the square root of the sample size, we’re essentially adjusting for the fact that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean tends to decrease as the sample size increases. This is due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal as the sample size increases, with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.

Solving for beta in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) requires us to find a line of best fit that minimizes the unexplained difference (the error). \nTo do this we take the sum of the squared residuals  \n\nIt may help to understand this through the formula of the residual. \n\nFirst the residual is the amount our actual observed value differs from the predicted value (This is in matrix notation). \n\n\\((y-\\textbf{X}\\beta_0)\\)\n\ny is our observed value and the \\(\\textbf{X}\\beta_0\\) is our predicted value (the line of best fit). \n\nWE SQUARE THIS!

Remember, we do not know the Beta. \n\nWe set to zero to find the critical point (the minimum) \nTaking the partial derivative with respect to beta, you’re essentially finding the point where the error function is not changing with respect to changes in beta. Where the slope of the error function with respect to beta is zero. \n\nFigure b is a visual representation of what this looks like when we set our minimum.

Then: vcv &lt;- s.2*(solve(t(X)%*%X))\n\nThis is our VCV of the X’s and then we take the square root of the diagonal to get our SE.\n\nWe use the omega (and the assumptions of no spherical errors) to derive the equation for the SE (equation above). However, if we have spherical disturbances and use the same equation to derive our standard errors then our standard errors are wrong.\nAndy:\nYes,if there are non-spherical disturbances than our standard VCV above isn’t technically correct anymore b/c the equation doesn’t simplify to that.\nStone:\nThen the omega matrix (and its assumptions) is related to the population error. And thus, when we get a sample with spherical disturbances that does not match our expectations of the population error of no spherical disturbances, we then must fix it. Right?\nAndy:\nRight…we can’t know what the population Omega is, but we can get a good guess based off our sample Omega matrix\nStone:\nSo, if we switch the order, e%*%t(e) gives us the matrix of errors (WHICH IS NOT THE OMEGA MATRIX(?)). We want our matrix of errors to look like the omega matrix. It never will but we use the various tests to figure out the level of spherical errors that are present in this matrix.\nAndy:\nThe matrix of the errors IS the Omega matrix, which is the variance covariance matrix of the errors (note the other VCV for our X’s above). It’ll never be spherical perfectly but our assumptions are about expectations so it just needs to be consistently a problem (e.g., 2 errors can be correlated, but it’s only a problem if on average there’s a correlation between errors)\nStone:\nThen when we detect spherical disturbances, we purge it or do whatever (FGLS, Robust/cluster SE), which then fixes our variance and then fixes our SE? Do I have all this right? This all feels kind of magical.\nAndy:\nIf you’re running FGLS you’re using the info in the residual Omega to adjust both your SE’s and coefficients. If you’re correcting just your SEs you’re basically adjusting the standard SE formula to account for the pattern you want to correct for."

Long story short, it is less taxing on your computer to do these calculations. Besides more computer sciencey explanations, your computer is doing matrix algebra all the time. \nFinally, matrix algebra will be used in further methods classes. This is especially important in machine learning. You are working with an array now but in machine learning, those arrays gain more dimensions.

Covariance is hard to interpret because the scale depends on the variances of two inputs.

Variance helps us understand the dispersion or variability in a data set. Variance estimates how far a set of numbers are spread out from the mean value. It can be difficult to interpret based on the output alone. This is because these values are squared, so we can’t really tell based on the number alone whether the value is relatively high or low.\nUnderstanding variance is critical in statistics.

To be a good instrumental variable, instrumental variables must satisfy two conditions:\n\nThe instrumental variable is theoretically relevant to x.\nThe instrumental variable must satisfy the exclusion restriction.\n\nThe first point requires that our instrument (z) must be endogenous to our independent variable (x)\nThe exclusion restriction is typically where instrumental variables get attacked. The instrumental variable (z in this case) must only affect X. Z-&gt; X -&gt; Y. The difficulty to this condition is that there is no statistical test. The exclusion restriction must be defended by theory.\nIt is very difficult to find an instrument that is both related to X and does not affect Y. An example of a good instrument is provided below (thank you ChrisP from StackExchange):\n“For example, suppose we want to estimate the effect of police (𝑥) on crime (𝑦) in a cross-section of cities. One issue is that places with lots of crime will hire more police. We therefore seek an instrument 𝑧𝑧 that is correlated with the size of the police force, but unrelated to crime.\nOne possible 𝑧 is number of firefighters. The assumptions are that cities with lots of firefighters also have large police forces (relevance) and that firefighters do not affect crime (exclusion). Relevance can be checked with the reduced form regressions, but whether firefighters also affect crime is something to be argued for. Theoretically, they do not and are therefore a valid instrument.”\n\nWhy should we use an instrumental variable?\nThe need for an instrumental variable arises when we are concerned for confounding variables or measurement error."

If the determinant of a matrix is zero, then we cannot take the inverse of that matrix. In a sense, the determinant “summaries” the information in the matrix. A specific type of information from a matrix. It is easier to talk about a single number than the whole data.\n\nDeterminants measure the factor of how much the area of a given region increases or decreases in space.\n\nhow much does the transformation stretch or squish “things”.\n\nthe determinant tells us the factor of how much a given area stretches or squishes.\n\nin 3 dimensions this tells us the factor of change in volume\n\n\n\nIf the determinant is zero, it is squishes all of space onto a line or single point. Since then, the area of any region would be zero.\nDeterminants are non-zero if the matrix has full rank\nonly a square matrix can have a determinant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an inverse is badly scaled or ill-conditioned, then the inverse is unstable. This means a tiny change in just one of the elements of the original matrix can result in HUGE changes in many (or all) of the elements of its inverse.\nKnowing how it is calculated isn’t super important. You can just google this if needed. Our computers can do this all as it gets much more tedious when we increase the # of dimensions.\nYou can compute a negative determinant (pre absolute value). This would tell you orientation and that the space has been inverted. If you still take the absolute value of the determinant, that still gives you the factor in which the space changed."

You can apply a transformation to it - rotate it, stretch bits, squash bits, etc. If you paint an arrow on the shape, after the transformation the arrow will most likely be pointing a different direction.\nBut sometimes the transformation you apply conspires to make so that the arrow doesn’t change direction. Maybe it gets stretched or squished, but it still points in the same direction. From the arrow’s perspective, all you did was scale it up or down in size by some amount.\nIf that happens, the arrow is called an eigenvector of the transformation, and the amount it gets scaled by is its associated eigenvalue. They are properties of the transformation itself, not the shape you apply it to.”\n\nA matrix can have multiple eigenvalues BUT no more than its number or rows/columns.\nEach eigenvalue is associate with a specific eigenvector.\nYou can get negative eigenvalues but they are not good for us in statistics.\n\n\nDefinite\n\neigenvalues are closely related to definiteness.\nWhy do we care about definiteness?\n\nIt is useful for establishing if a (multivariate) function has a maximum, minimum or neither at a critical point.\n\nthis is important for regression (OLS). We are trying to find the line that minimizes the squared difference.\n\n\nWe want positive definiteness.\n\nTo have positive definiteness we need our matrix to satisfy the following:\n\nsymmetric\nall eigenvalues are positive\nall the subdeterminants are positive\nyou could also just calculate the quadratic form and check its positiveness\n\nif the quadratic form is &gt; 0 then it is positive definiteness.\nwe want a positive definite matrix because it is good for interpretation."

Their overall format is the same but the shorthand symbols, such as “dx,” are replaced by their stylized version of the letter d: \\(\\partial\\). Partial derivatives should be labeled as \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\), depending on the variable being derived.\nThe two derivatives should be read as “The partial derivative, with respect to x,” and “The partial derivative, with respect to y.”\n\nWhen taking a partial derivative with respect to a particular variable, treat all other variables as though they are constants.\n\nWhen deriving with respect to x, treat y as a constant, and do not derive the y.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\\(f(x,y)=x^2y+2x^3\\)\n\\(f(x,y)=xy^2+x^3\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x)y^2+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3)=y^2 +3x^2\\)\n\ntake the partial derivative, with respect to x.\n\nhold y constant.\nthe \\(y^2+3x^2\\) is the rate of change for the function.\n\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}x(y^2)+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}x^3=2xy+0=2xy\\)\n\ntake the partial derivative, with respect to y.\n\nhold x constant. `\nthe \\(2xy\\) is the rate of change for the function."

(British spelling)\nAbstract: This article discusses and reviews the growing literature on the nexus of macro-level structures and individual behaviour that some studies are a part of. It looks at the effects that macro-level institutions and contexts have on citizen behaviour, along with how political institutions and the environment where citizens form opinions and act, help in moderating the effects of individual-level factors on citizen behaviour. The modelling structures and behaviour, effects of structures on voter behaviour, and the interactions of structures and behaviour in research on economic voting are some of the topics covered in the article.\nOutline:\n\nDoes x cause behaviour y? It depends!\n\nExample: Does institutional performance affect people’s sense of whether their political system is legitimate?\n\nAnswer: The impact of corruption on system support is conditional on whether citizens are supporters of the incumbent government.\n\nStudies are getting better at using institutions and context to predict the effects of citizen behaviour.\n\nComparative study of structures and behaviour = citizens in context \nContext and behaviour intimately connected by:\n\nFormal and informal rules; people’s preferences, attitudes, and behaviour affect the establishment and functioning of rules\nCitizens are exposed to variable social, political, and economic environments that they are supposed to understand, interpret, and sometimes shape\n\nAdvances in surveys, replication, and computing have allowed for cross-national and multi-level research into behaviour\n1980s and 1990s renewed focus on institutional questions across polysci that could be tested, as well as interest in developing contextual theories of political behaviour\nComparative study of behaviour politics has investigated macro-level contexts/structures:\n\nInstitutions\nStructural conditions\n\nInteraction between structures and behaviour presumes several things:\n\nPolitics is about the interaction of people’s values and the rules and conditions that govern the implementation of those values\nThe rules and realities in which citizens make choices are themselves a function of people’s values\n\n“Put another way: contexts are critical for understanding the decisions people make because they affect different people differently, and people’s decisions, in turn, shape the nature, shape, and stability of these contexts” (678).\n\n\nCommon approach assumes that context shapes behaviour; assumes behaviour to be DV and that it is exogenous and stable\n\nDo institutions have direct effects on behaviour?\n\nVoting example: structures can affect voters directly, indirectly, and interactively (or contingently)\n\nDirect: rational choice theory; individuals weigh costs and benefits of voting and act accordingly\nIndirect: behaviours of elites within electoral rules empower or constrain citizen choices; structures have consequences but these consequences have secondary (or indirect) effects on behaviour\nContingent: effect of some structural feature strengthened or weakened, depending on presence of some 3rd variable; the turnout gap between individuals with many and few resources is particularly pronounced in countries where the cost of voting is high\n\n\n\n\n{INSERT PHOTO HERE}\n\nRecent studies have looked at how the nature of a country’s representative structures interacts with the willingness of voters to punish governments for bad economic performance\n\nBad economy impact hinges on ability of voters to hold gov’t responsible\nInstitutions can hamper this ability of voters to reward or punish gov’ts\nClarity of responsibility also varies over time within (and across) countries b/c of election outcomes that change bargaining power and reshape context\nAlso contingent upon credible alternatives for voters to vote into office\n\nInteractions of vote choice and structures in research on legitimacy\n\nWhat role do institutions play in moderating sense of loss or victory citizens feel?\n\nInstitutions shape the responses of winners and losers; citizen attitudes toward democratic institutions shaped by country’s political context\n\n\n“At the end of the day, what is particularly noteworthy about cross-level investigations of behavioural politics is that they hold the promise of producing a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of political life by connected hitherto unconnected streams of scholarship in the areas of institutions, political economy, policy, and behaviour and allowing us a better and more complex empirical and theoretical handle on the hows and whys of citizen politics” (690)."

Arnold A. Rogow, cited p.482).  \n\n\nKEY ARGUMENT:\nFollowing evidence and psychological research on personality traits of  different society’s strata, Lipset posits that the lower strata are predisposed to support  authoritarianism due to a lack of “sophistication” and facing economic and psychological  insecurity. The lower class will support economic liberalism but not political liberalism, while the  middle and upper class will support political liberalism. Hence, according to Lipset, there is a  natural link between the lower-class attitudes and their support of Communism. \n-Pre-1914: working-class supported both economic and political liberalism \n-Post-1914: “The intransigent, intolerant, and demonological aspects of Communist ideology attract members from the lower class of low-income, low-status occupations, and little education” (483).\n\n\nDEMOCRATIC VALUES AND STRATIFICATION:\n• “Leftism/economic liberalism associated with socio-economic status” (485). • “Psychologically oriented investigators have studied the social correlates of authoritarian  personality structures as measured by the now famous F scale”(Adorno, 1950, cited p.  486). \n• Even in conservatism, economic status predicts tolerance levels (see Eysenck, 1956 and  Stouffer, 1955, cited p.486)\n\n\nAUTHORITARIAN RELIGION AND STRATIFICATION:\n• Fundamentalist and chiliastic/millennial religious tradition as a predisposition for drastic  and rapid measures demanding authoritarian order. \n• The appeal of fundamentalism to the lower class acts as a pressure valve in a utopian world  where the upper class no longer dominates. \n• See Engels and his take on evangelism (488). \n\n\nTYPICAL SOCIAL SITUATION OF LOWER-CLASS PERSON\n\n“There is consistent evidence that degree of formal education, itself closely correlated with  social and economic status, is also highly correlated with undemocratic attitudes” (489). • Education predicts attitudes better than occupation (Morris Janowitz and Dwaine Marvick study, cited pp.489-490). \nPrincipal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  “sophistication,” economic security, and psychological security -&gt; mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = “surviving”  \n\n\n\nTHE PERSPECTIVES OF LOWER-CLASS GROUPS\n\nPrincipal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  “sophistication,” economic security, and psychological security -&gt; mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = “surviving”\nIncapacity of mental abstraction and fixed mental context\n\n\n\nEXTREMISM AS A COMPLEX ALTERNATIVE: A TEST OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nWhen the Communist Party is small and weak, it tends to uphold non-economic  liberalism/democratic values because of the presence of intellectual leadership. \nWhen the Communist Party (or Socialist in some cases) is a mass party, it tends to be more  authoritarian (or less committed to democratic values) because it has stripped its  intellectual leadership.\nUnderdeveloped countries/economies exacerbate the problems of the lower class and  increase the predisposition to authoritarianism on a like-for-like basis. \nThis argument is evaluated subnationally and supports the urban/rural predisposition to  uphold democratic values and political liberalism.\n\nHISTORICAL PATTERNS AND DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS\n\nHistorically, the left has been responsible for democratization; intellectual leadership still  supports democratic values, but the masses of the lower strata do not understand the  implications of the left beyond economic value to them. \nConservatism is vulnerable in democracy for demographic reasons (500). • Neither conservatism nor the authoritarian predisposition of the lower class should be seen  as a threat to democracy. \nEducational attainment is an essential “Social Requisites of Democracy” (Lipset, 1959)."

Zuckerman, Ed., The Social Logic of Politics: Personal Networks as Contexts for Political Behavior. Temple University Press.\n\nChapter 1: Returning to the Social Logic of Political Behavior\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Despite a period of deviation from theory, social logic is important for studying political choice.” \n\n\nSummary: \nThis chapter offers an intellectual history of the critical texts that defined the research orientation of political behavior. Is focuses on how traditional theories from sociology and psychology informed our understanding of political behaviors through interactions with primary groups. However, along the way, the political science discipline that studied behavior began undergoing changes to the way behavioral study was approached - emphasizing, instead, individual level survey research and a reconceptualization of social logic. Fortunately, social logic is back on the mend. \n\n\nResearch Question/Purpose: \nThe purpose of this chapter is to outline the reasons for which those who study political choice and behavior should return to the social logic of the original behavioral revolution in political science. \n\n\nData/Methods: \nThere is no data used. Passages, statements, and long quotations stand in for the data. Draws on authors such as Campbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes, Verba Findings: \nWe need to return to our roots an incorporate social logic back into behavioral political science \nInterpersonal relationships can both prevent and facilitate change \nMany scholars broke away from social logic, pursuing instead individual level analysis from surveys and redefining social logic to fit their particular needs Newer research is returning to social logic\n\n\nDefinitions: \nSocial Logic of Politics:\na theory of politics that emphasizes the ways in which social factors (social identities, distribution of power across groups, public opinion) influence individual behaviors and how those interact with institutional structures to effect the political process. \n\n\nDiscussion Questions: \nWhat are the consequences of the social logic of politics for our understanding of those communities/persons with intersectional identities? Is this theory anglo centric, or does it retain its superior qualities across groups? \nHow might association through primary groups have an impact of institutions? At what point does the saliency of group association diminish? Do our politics/attitudes change drastically with each primary group we grow closer to, or do those groups we first develop our attitudes through matter most? \n\n\nAdditional Notes: \n\n\nIntro: \nThe immediate social circumstances of people’s lives influence what they believe and do about politics \nImmediate social circles are powerful forces in swaying ones political beliefs and actions \nGroup relationships are important for fixing and maintaining opinions in relation to large parts of the political system (such as parties) (Key, 1961) \n\n\nSources in Sociology: \nparticularly influential were Lazarsfeld, Katz, Berelson, Gaudet, and McPhee Electoral Sociology was where the onset of the behavioral revolution in political science first observed electoral choice \nVoting is a reflection of our behavior - of our conversations with other people and the attitudes we shape through those interactions \nBy this logic, we vote based on how the relationships we have shape us This is counter to theories of voting as a rational act \n\n\nSources in Social Psychology \nparticularly influential were Kurt Lewin and Leon Festinger \nhelped explain conformity\nsharing an identity (social class, ethnicity, religion, etc.) does NOT define a social group \nopinions, preferences, and beliefs are a joint function of how “real” the matter is, the views held by the members of a person’s groups, and the persons own conceptions joining a group tends to produce changes in opinions and attitudes toward alignment with the group \n\n\nThe Turn Away from the Social Logic of Politics \n\nStarted to examine individuals instead of groups \nBegan surveying a lot (members of the same social circles shouldn’t be surveyed together -- its no longer as-if random, and you introduce bias into your survey responses) \nTurned social groups into objects of individual identification \nElectoral research shifted towards understanding party identification and perceptions of candidates \n\n\nWhat factors explain this shift away from the social logic? \nOne set derives from decision to use national sample surveys as the exclusive source of empirical evidence of behavior \nAnother set derives from theory issues -- PoliSci insisted that sociologists couldn’t explain electoral decisions or outcomes -- opted instead for immediate determinants of vote choice: attitudes and calculations \nStatistics professors, rearing political sciences, conveyed cherished assumptions of independent sampling -- which makes it nearly impossible to capture the psychology of inter-dependance \n\n\nRecognizing that data problems inhibited their ability to follow theoretical preferences \nCampbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes altered the definition of the social group and conceptualized it according to a personal perceptions regarding a reference object - taking it far away from its original intent/definition from Lewis Many others would make even larger breaks, such as Key and Downs (immediate circle provides no more than time-saving sources of information to calculating citizens) \n\n\n\nReturning (Again) to the Social Logic of Politics \nWe returned! \nMichigan survey responses can be used to study the role of immediate social structures on political choice and behavior \nTon of other research is starting to do the same thing"

    "text": "Converse, Philip E. 2006 [1964]. “The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics.” Critical  Review: A Journal of Politics and Society 18(1): 1-74\n\nNormative question: \nDoes the citizenry have the “capacity” to participate in democracy? Concern the age-old  question of the demos’ potential to access information and process it in a way that would be  individually coherent in election expressions. Converse’s (1964) “The Nature of Belief Systems  in Mass Publics” marks a turning point since it can quantitatively/statistically demonstrate\ndemocracy defenders’ worst fears: the mass public competence for a normative functioning of  democracy is blight. This question has also been approached with similar results by Lipmann (1922), “Public Opinion” and Schumpeter (1950), “Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy” (see  also Bennett, 2006, “Democratic Competence, Before Converse and After”). \n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nMass Public: Ideologically Innocent  \n\n\nDV:\nDegree of Belief System Coherence (Individual) (a continuum)\n\n\nIV:\nLevel of Constrained Idea-Elements (a continuum)\n\n\nData:\nConverse stipulates that the degree of coherence of the mass public belief system is contingent on the level of constraints of the idea-elements populating a belief system: the more constrained, the  more coherent. This, in turn, predicts a degree of capacity to participate in democracy according  to one’s self-assessed ideological placement. Idea-elements are mainly constrained by the  transmission of information and its digestibility. For this reason, Converse finds that 15% of the  population is deemed ideologue or near-ideologue (possessing a coherent belief system = elite political actors). In contrast, the remaining 85% (the masses) float between having a particular  interest (issue public) or having no idea. If ideology is not driving most of the public’s opinion  incentive, what is? Converse suggests that “visible” social groupings serve as a stable heuristic  informing public opinion: party ID (.70) has more bearing than policies, but policies concerning  visible groups (school desegregation .45) have more bearing than regular policies (government and housing .28). This “ideology by proxy” might produce idiosyncratic outcomes as well: the  working man associating with Socialists against the rich but against government reigning of private  enterprise’s provision of public goods. \n\nPICTURE HERE\nAcquiring and processing information is contingent on education. Education is more prevalent in  higher strata of society (Lipset, 1959, “Social Requisite of Democracy”).\n\nPICTURE HERE\n\n\nInteresting proposition: “The net result of these circumstances is that the elites of the leftist parties enjoy a”natural” numerical superiority, yet they are cursed with a clientele that is less dependable or solid in its support. The rightist elite has a natural clientele that is more limited but more dependable.”"

Ch. 6: 100-122.\n\nBumper Sticker:\nSocial networks allow us to rethink and re-conceptualize the role of groups in mass politics and public opinion.\n\n\nAbstract\nThis article presents a survey and interpretation of the contributions made by #network #theories on the study of citizens and democratic policies. The article serves as an overview of the topic. It begins by locating the network research within the rich substantive and theoretical tradition of individually and #group-based studies of #electoral #politics and #public #opinion . It addresses some methodological issues in the study of political information #networks. The article ends with the discussion of theoretical and substantive insights that were generated in several studies, such as the study of communication and persuasion among citizens.\n\n\nResearch Question:\nWhat is network analysis? What are the theoretical and substantive insights that we can derive from it, particularly regarding the study of communication and persuasion among citizens? What are some of the methodological issues of network analysis?\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nThe author sets out to analyze the contribution of network theories, which have provided us the ability to analyze citizen and democratic politics from across the micro-macro spectrum. Network theories draw on the importance of groups, communities, and political information networks among and between individuals (Downs 1957) while incorporating a conceptual apparatus that extends far past the traditional notions of primary groups, organizations, and societal groups in order to define the relationships that exist among individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Despite its advantages, there are still some methodological issues with network analysis.\n\n\nData/Methods:\nIt is a literature review so no real data/methods.\n\n\nFindings:\n\nWhat is network analysis and how does it fit into the existing literature on the study of individuals and groups?\n\nNetwork studies can be seen as a particular species within a larger genus—as one type of a contextual analysis of politics (Knoke 1990)\nnetworks are formed at the complex intersection between individual preference, individual engagement, and individual location within particular contexts.\nEulau (1986) and Przeworski and Teune (1970) define contextual factors in terms of the aggregation of individual characteristics that affect individuals through processes of social interaction.\n\nNetwork Studies diverge from contextual studies in their effort to incorporate a direct mapping for the particular patterns of recurrent interaction among actors.\n\nIndividual level and aggregate level analysis both suffer from the same problem: they ignore the implications that arise due to patterns of individual interdependence located in time, place, and setting.\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the methodological issues of the study of political information networks?\n\nAbsent direct measures on patterns of communication, neither the individual measures nor their associated aggregate versions directly address the specifics of communication and persuasion among the individuals who make up the aggregates.\nNetwork studies are particularly useful in analyzing well defined populations - such as clergies, political elites, court, and legislatures.\n\nan unfortunate limitation of egocentric networks is the failure to embed dyads within larger networks and in the context of all other dyads in that same network.\nHowever, they aren’t straightforward when analyzing large populations - which is the primary object of study for scholars concerned with studies of mass behavior (egocentric network survey questions and snowball surveys can help address this; pg. 5-6)\n\nPolitical communication networks are created at the intersection of individual choice (demand) and environmental supply (which is stochastic).\n\n\n\nWhat are the substantive and theoretical insights generated by it?\n\nPeople are more inclined to discuss politics with others who share similar political beliefs\nStudies ALSO demonstrate that patterns of both agreement and disagreement can be profitably understood within complex processes of communication and persuasion\n\nThis means that there is persistent heterogeneity of opinions in less-dense (larger) social networks people aren’t as afraid of disagreement as we initially thought\n\nPolitical heterogeneity in the form of cross cutting cleavages can depress political participation BUT increased levels of tolerance (which might be good?)\nPolitical communication networks are more important in less developed democracy, where parties are less institutionalize and politics is more volatile\nDiversity of group discussion decreases the susceptibility of individuals to issue framing by elites\nNetwork studies of political communication and persuasion provide a theoretical, analytical response to the human limitations of the citizen in democratic politics.\n\nthis is important because it to do with the cognitive limitations of individuals in being self-contained, fully informed, independent maximizers\nparticularly useful is social capital - which allows people to rely on one another for accurate information\n\npolitical interdependence among citizens helps to explain why public opinion in the aggregate is more sophisticated than the opinions held by the average citizen - its more fully informed\nsolutions to collective action problems can be seen as occurring within networks of relationships among strategic actors who use the information they acquire through repeated interactions to facilitate group efforts"

There are two lines of literature that provide contradictory findings:\n\nOne argues that threat increases authoritarian preferences among those that are more prone to authoritarianism\nAnother argues that threat is associated with a switch in ideology among those who are normally non-authoritarian Using a two-wave panel study of the French population taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris, the authors find that the two occur simultaneously.\n\n\n\nResearch Question:\nWhat best explains the relationship between individual perceptions of threat and increased preferences for authoritarian policy?\nIs the increase in support for authoritarian policies following a terrorist attack the result of:\n\nconservative and authoritarian prone individuals just more strongly manifesting their disposition in response to threat\nOR increases in ideological “switching” to support authoritarian policies in light of threatening events?\n\n\n\nTheory/Argument:\nThe authors argue that the endorsement of authoritarian policies can be explained by the theory of affective intelligence. When people experience anxiety due to novel circumstances, such as that induced by terrorist attacks, they will abandon their habitual political attachments and attend to the circumstance in a risk-averse and conservative manner.\n\nH1: increased anger will enhance decision making based on past dispositional convictions, leading to increased polarization between left and right wing individuals (strengthen authoritarian tendencies for right-wing and weaken those same tendencies for the right)\nH2: increased anxiety will initiate decision-making that is less reliant on extant convictions and hence make those on the left end of the left-right scale more attentive and responsive to calls from the right to adopt authoritarian policies.\n\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nTwo-wave panel taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris\nData retrieved from the CEVIPOF barometer of political confidence\n\nsurvey was conducted using a representative sample containing 1,524 respondents in two waves\n\nConstruct two OLS models\n\none measures attitude change as a function of demographic variables, ideology, as well as anxiety and anger\nsecond model includes two interaction terms that assess fear and anger with the left-right scale respectively with the expectation that the effect of fear and anger on authoritarian policies with be conditional on prior ideological conviction\n\n\nModel 1:\n\\[\nAttiude_{t2}=fear_{t2}+anger_{t2}+left/right\\: scale_{t1}+attitude_{t1}+demographics_{t1}\n\\]\nModel 2:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}Attitude_{t2} &= fear_{t2} + anger_{t2} + left/right\\: scale_{t1} \\\\&+ fear_{t2} * left/right\\: scale_1 + anger_{t2} * left/right\\: scale + attitude_{t1} + demographics_{t1}\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nDependent Variable:\n\nsupport for authoritarian policies\na scale consisting of all available items in the study that measure adoption or rejection of authoritarian politic preferences\n\neach item (survey question) was measured using 4-point response option (higher values = support for authoritarian policies)\nonly one factor possessed an eigenvalue over 1\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Variable:\n\nemotional reaction to the terrorist attacks\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nThreat increases authoritarian preferences among those who are more prone to authoritarianism AND those with non-authoritarian ideology\nOverall, people who felt fear following the attack were more likely to have switched their opinion in an authoritarian direction\nLeft-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful after the attack were more likely to change in the direction of endorsing authoritarian policies\nRight-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful did not experience a change in direction of endorsing authoritarian policies\nRight-wing citizens who gelt predominantly angry following the attack experienced heightened endorsement of authoritarianism\nLeft-wing citizen on the far-left who felt predominantly angry were the least likely to support authoritarian politics following the attacks (see figure 3) but is not statistically significant\nH2 is supported by the first OLS model\nH1 is not supported UNTIL the conditional model\n\n\n\nImportance/Contribution:\n\ncontributes to our understanding of individual level variation in the endorsement of authoritarian policies as well as our understanding of attitudinal polarization (why fear might reduce polarization across a public)\nimportant because the psychological mechanisms that account for the public’s reaction to terrorist attacks is key to understanding enhanced support for the restriction of civil liberties\nalso advances and systematizes the literature of emotions and politics by assessing the impact of anxiety and anger on the formation of political attitudes\ntakes advantage of REAL threat perceptions, instead of experimentally manipulated ones\nhas external validity (uses a representative sample of the French population)\nchallenges conventional wisdom that emotions are irrational, turbulent states that hinder reasoning - affect activates political reasoning\n\n\n\nDefinitions/Concepts:\n\nTheories of Affective Intelligence\n\nprovides a framework for understanding the interplay of fear and anger with ideological convictions\nwith respect to anxiety, the theory holds that when citizens find themselves in novel circumstances, they tend to break from habitual political attachments (ideology/partisanship) and actively try to attend to contemporary circumstances about their environment.\nwith respect to anger, the theory holds that it may trigger authoritarian policy preferences through the activation of habitually learned routines, activating conservative or authoritarian attitudes among individuals who already hold a right-wing disposition.\n\nit is not the potency of threat the increases anger, but rather the degree of normative violation\n\n\n\n\nTerror Management Theory (TMT)\n\npeople feel threatened by their own death and therefore adopt worldviews that allow them to find meaning and worth in their lives.\n\nawareness of ones death can cause anxiety\nis used to explain that mortality-related threat reinforces extant political beliefs regardless of whether these are liberal or conservative.\npolitical ideology serves as a protective shield against death anxiety.\n\n\n\n\nLeft-Right Ideological Identification\n\ndefined by the authors as the an organized cluster of political values that make some individuals more inclined to support some political ideas than others.\n\n\n\nThreat\n\ndefined by the authors as an exogenous event that poses harmful consequences for the individual or her environment and evokes negative emotional reactions.\n\n\n\nAnxiety\n\nelevated in threatening circumstances and is one of the prime emotional reactions to a terrorist event when heightened, conveys a perception of increased risk and prompts individuals to adopt risk-averse behavior to eliminate or avert the threat\n\n\n\nAnger\n\ngenerated when people are obstructed from reaching a valued goal by an external agent whose conduct is deemed unfair and in cases when a threatening stimulus is perceived\n\n\n\nThreat Stimulus\n\nAssessed on two distinct grounds:\n\nis the event novel?

This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being “motivated- skepticals” when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e. spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of “partisan processing” that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:\nH1: there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs\nH2: there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments\nH3: there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones\nThese combined will results in:\nH4: attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments\nWhich is conditional upon:\nH5: the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism\nH6: and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nTwo experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control\nThe participants (Ps) were recruited from introductory political science courses at Stony Brook University\nStudy 1: N=126\nStudy 2: N=136\nFirst Part: Confirmation Bias\nThe participants (Ps) were seated at computers and their political attitudes were assessed through the evaluation of a series of contemporary political issues aimed at activating their priors - this was done through random assignment into either condition 1 or condition 2 (see figure 1)\nThey rated the items on a series of scales to assess attitude strength (0-100) and attitude position (like-dislike; 9 item scale)\nThey then viewed information on an information board, where they could seek out hidden policy arguments by known source alone (see figure 2); the amount of time they spend engaging in each argument was recorded by the software.\nThey viewed eight arguments without a time limit, but could only view each argument ONCE\nThey then completed the same attitude battery from the beginning of the experiment before filing out demographic information and a political knowledge scale ( to assess sophistication)\nSecond Part: Disconfirmation Bias\nadministered the battery again, but with the conditions (issues) swapped.\nthen asked to rank the strength of 8 arguments (4 pro and 4 con)\nthen there was a post test battery AGAIN and a recognition memory test\nthey were also asked to list their thoughts regarding two pro and two con arguments they were presented with Arguments were taken from online sources and edited such that they were similar in complexity and length.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nstrong evidence of a prior attitude effect (H1) such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments.\nParticipants counter-argued the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias (H2) - this was supported by the participants spending MORE time on the policy arguments that they disagreed with\nAlso find a confirmation bias (H3)—the seeking out of confirmatory evidence—when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read - this was supported by the participants seeking out information in the matrix that they agreed with\nBoth the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization (H4) —the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes—especially among those with the strongest priors (H5) and highest levels of political sophistication (H6)."

Such measurements tend to vary in terms of how they are phrased on surveys and also struggle to capture the range of partisan identity, typically at the low and high ends of the spectrum. The authors believe that they can develop a multi-item scale of partisan identity that better predicts political behavior ACROSS various multiparty democracies than the traditional single item scales common on surveys. \n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nPartisan Identity Scale\nCreates an Eight-Item Scale of Partisanship that is derived from Social Identity Theory Derives three (3) hypothesis to test whether the scale is better than traditional models: H1: The Partisan Identity Scale should differentiate equally well among low, middling, and high levels of identity to best uncover the link between identity and political activity across its full range. Expect each scale item to provide more complete information about partisan strength than the traditional single party identification item. \nIn terms of the IRT analysis, this means that each item’s information function will be more peaked and contain greater information than the standard single measure of partisan strength. In the three European multi-party systems under study, we expect both lower and higher levels of partisan intensity to remain less well detected when measured with the traditional item\nH2: the partisan identity scale to exhibit all three types of invariance, which means that the fit of the metric invariance model will be no worse than the fit of the configural model, and that the fit of the scalar model will be no worse than that of the metric model. \nH3: The partisan identity scale should more powerfully predict in-party voting and political engagement than the traditional party identification item. We also expect the partisan identity scale to better predict political behavior than a multi-item indicator of ideological intensity \n\n\n\nData:\nUses Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K. as the three countries with which to derive and apply the scale.\n\nNetherlands:\n2012 Dutch Parliamentary elections among members of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The LISS contains 5000 households, entailing 8000 individuals Data are drawn from three time points: August 2012 (‘’Elections 2012’‘), after the national election in September 2012 (’‘Dutch Parliamentary Election Study’‘), and again as part of a module in December 2012/January 2013 (’‘Politics and Values: Wave 6’’).\n\n\nSweden:\nSwedish data were drawn from the Swedish Citizen Panel, a largely opt-in online panel run by the Laboratory of Opinion Research (LORE) at the University of Gothenburg. \nUtilize data from Panel 8 (11/14/13–12/18/13) and add-on Panel 8-2 (12/10/13–1/7/14). 16,130 panelists were invited to take the Panel 8 survey and 9279 completed it for a completion rate of 64 %. \n2000 panelists were invited to complete Panel 8-2 of which 1496 answered the survey. All panelists in Panel 8.2 and a randomly selected 2000 panelists in Citizen Panel 8 received the identity model. \nOur analytic sample is confined to those in Panel 8 and Panel 8-2 who completed the identity items (N = 2464). \n\n\nUK:\nData for the U.K were taken from the 2015 British Election Study (BES), an online panel study conducted by YouGov. \ndraw on data from pre-election wave 3 of the BES, conducted between September 19, 2014 and October 17, 2014 and pre- election wave 4, conducted in March 2015. \nIn total, 27,839 respondents participated in wave 3 and 6141 were randomly assigned and 5954 completed a module that included the partisan identity items. \nIn wave 4, 16,629 respondents participated and 3500 of them completed the partisan identity module.\n\n\n\nMeasures:\nPartisanship Strength by Country vs. Partisan Identity Strength (the 8 Item Scale that is also known as the Partisan Identity Scale) \n\n\nMethods:\nthe methods are pretty complex, but essentially each hypothesis undergoes a different set of tests/inquiry. \nH1 - figure 1 shows how the 8 item scale that the authors derived is better measure of latent partisan strength than the individual measures in each country. This is also event in the peaks that you can see in each figure. They are more much more sensitive to to the full range of the low- high spectrum. H2 - invariance is measured using R software to perform multi-group confirmatory analysis (CFA) Configural invariance is a good fit \nThe partisan scale has the same metric across countries \nIts also scalar across countries \nH3 - analyse the determinants of in-party voting using a logistic regression model \nPartisan identity strength has a sizeable influence on in-party voting and its effects exceed that of partisanship strength. \nPartisan identity predicted in- party vote and participation while holding partisan strength constant\n\n\nFindings:\nLevels of partisanship have decreased in Europe in recent decades. \nThe eight-item partisan identification scale: \n\nprovides greater information about partisan intensity than the standard single-item\npossess the same measurement across all three countries \nbetter predicts in-party voting and political participation than ideological intensity measures"

To the authors, the reason for this has to do with the “hierarchy of values”. When people have obvious values that rank higher than others (humanitarianism, egalitarianism, equality) AND these #values align with political elites values, then partisan identity remains a steady tool with which to measure the political world against. HOWEVER, for some people, the values rank similarly and therefore cause conflicting #preferences that individuals struggle to resolve. Competing values will produce #volatility in partisan opinions specifically when individuals endorse values that cross the fault lines of partisan dialogue \n\n\nData/Methods:\nData: ANES data from 1992, 1994, and 1996\nModel: Estimates several heteroskedastic regression models as well as ordered probit models The heteroskedastic regression models are used because they expect differences in the response variance of party identification survey items to reflect value-conflict \nthis is because citizens with ideologically inconsistent value structures will struggle to identify with one party or another \nthere should be unequal variance across observations (which is heteroskedastic) \nthis heteroskedasticity is modeled to see if those who experience value conflict reveal less predictable responses to party identification survey items than those who do \n\n\nIndependent Variable:\nValue conflict \nis measured using 4 core values in American Politics: \nEgalitarianism, limited government, moral traditionalism, and humanitarianism \nThe measures for these values are derived from a set of ANES survey questions on each value\n1992 and 1996 are the years they were taken from (1992 is missing humanitarianism)\n\n\nDependent Variable:\nPartisan Instability \nTwo “manifestations” \n\npredictability of survey response (those experience value conflict should have less predictable responses to partisan questions) to two survey questions: \n\nseven-point party identification scale and ideological self identification scale \n\nchange in party identification over time (this one is tested using the 1994 and 1996 panel data) \n\n\n\nFindings:\n1992 and 1996 elections reveal value-driven volatility in partisan identification \n\nInstabilities in political views reflect either: \n\nlow information (for some) \ntrade-offs of the political world that cause conflict of values \n\n\nValue conflict will disrupt partisan stability when an individuals value organization is non-ideological - i.e. it doesn’t quite fit the rhetoric or portrayal by the liberal vs. conservative, left-right spectrum. what makes it non-ideological is that you support values on BOTH sides \nThose that have values the match political elites leads to stable partisanship \nThose that have internalized value organization that doesn’t match elites leads to conflicts of values and partisan volatility. \nElites identify and interpret core values to justify their policy positions \nValues and ideology are traditionally distinct concepts - but values can be distributed along an ideological spectrum"

    "text": "Benton, A. L. (2005). “Dissatisfied Democrats or retrospective voters?”, 38(4), 417–442.\n\nAbstract:\nThis article examines recent trends in #Latin-American #voting-behavior and casts them in terms of sincere (economic) and strategic (electoral) concerns. It argues that thanks to years of economic adversity, Latin Americans have developed long, sophisticated #economic-memories . Although this has resulted in rising frustration with democratic government, according to recent opinion polls, it has not always led voters to #punish all parties responsible for hardship at election time. A panel study of the region’s presidential systems demonstrates that citizens punish incumbents by voting for established #nonincumbents when electoral laws reduce opportunities available to small parties in the systems, even if #nonincumbents have also been blamed for hard economic times. More #permissive-electoral-systems , in contrast, encourage citizens to reject all parties responsible for economic decline. The analysis demonstrates how economic and electoral concerns interact to affect voting behavior, #political-accountability , and #public-opinion in Latin America.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nEconomic Evaluations Voter Laws Voter Behavior\n\n\nResearch Question:\nIf most Latin Americans have faced economic hardship during successive governments, why do they reject both the incumbent and non-incumbent parties in some systems and only the incumbent party in others?\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nMany Latin American economies have experienced some form poor performance that has resulted in different forms of electoral punishment. Barton, drawing on previous literature regarding economic theories of voter behavior, devises a theory that enables her to assess the institutional features that interact with economic performance to determine who voters choose to punish in subsequent elections. In highly permissible systems, where there are more parties to choose from, voters memories of economic performance can interact with electoral strategies to allow the punishment of multiple parties (as has been the case in multiple countries). However, more restrictive systems, which limit the number of viable parties, forces voters to focus their punishing efforts on the incumbent alone, as they require an alternative option of some form and therefore increases support for the form incumbent.\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\npanel data from 13 Latin American Countries\n\nrequired (a) to be a presidential system and have had (b) more than one party win the presidency, so that current and former incumbents compete; (c) to have elections deemed free of fraud by international observers, so that their results reflect voters’ reactions to party performance; and (d) to have an economic crisis and/or economic reform during democratic rule.\nin these countries, 64 elections were held, with 39 instances in which current and former incumbents competed for power\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Variable:\neconomic performance as measured by the percentage change in GDP per capita during each parties last 2 years in office.\n\n\nDependent Variable:\n\nChange in support for incumbents - measured as the difference between votes received by an incumbent party in presidential elections while in office and votes received in the previous election when the party won.\nChange in support for non-incumbents out of power - measured as change in support received in elections after leaving office and support when the party originally came into power.\n\n\n\nModel:\n\nUses OLS with #panel-corrected standard errors #PCSEs , which were selected because of the limited number of countries and small (often unbalanced) number of observations in each panel.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nH1: When incumbent parties are blamed for poor economic performance, they will lose support, regardless of the electoral system used to elect them.\nH2: Nonincumbent parties previously in power will derive greater electoral benefits in restrictive, compared with permissive, electoral contexts when incumbent parties are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.\nH3: Former incumbents blamed for economic decline will continue to receive lower levels of support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts, all else being equal.\nH4: Current incumbents will gain support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts when former incumbents are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis\nSupport\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nH1\nYes\nincumbent parties’ support decreases with economic downturns, without regard to institutional change (p.430)\n\n\nH2\nYes\nwhen electoral laws construct institutional barriers to small parties (restrictive), groups once holding the presidency will suffer losses in support when incumbents manage economic growth; as GDP declines, parties previously in power begin to experience a surge of supprot (p.431)\n\n\nH3\nYes\naccounting for the presence of Honduras, there was no relationship between poor economic performance and punishment of former incumbents in restrictive systems; there was a relationship between poor economic performance and the punishment of incumbents in permissive systems (pg.436)\n\n\nH4\nYes\nnonincumbents’ performance has implications for incumbents’ support. As predicted, incumbents gain about 10% of the national votes when nonincumbents are responsible for neoliberal economic reform in all electoral settings\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Findings:\n\nRestrictive institutions reduce the incentive for voters to waste support on parties unlikely to win.\nRather than helping nonincumbents weather the electoral effect of incumbents’ economic growth, runoffs cause nonincumbents to suffer additional electoral losses."

    "text": "Lewis-Beck, Michael S., and Mary Stegmaier. 2009. “Economic Models of Voting.” OHPB. Ch. 27: 518-537.\n\nBumper Sticker:\nThe state of the economy can help predict voter decisions.\n\n\nPurpose:\nThis is a literature review on micro-level, survey research studies of economic voting in the U.S., Britain, France, and Globally.\n\n\nOverview:\nQuestions regarding the precise nature of economic voting led to four general “types”.\n\nRetrospective Voting\n\nOriginating with V.O. Key (1966), this type of voting occurs when voters review the performance of the incumbent government.\n\nProspective Voting\n\nOriginating with Downs (1957), this type of voting occurs when voters look to the future and vote according to the governments potential economic performance.\n\nPocketbook Voting (personal finances)\n\nThis theory of voting suggests that when personal or household financial conditions have deteriorated, voters will punish the incumbent.\n\nSociotropic Voting (national economy rather than personal finances).\n\nThis theory of voting suggests that voters are more likely to be considering the national economic situation when casting their vote.\n\n\nOf these types, the retrospective sociotropic and prospective sociotropic appear to be the most relevant across empirical evaluations. That is, people tend to vote based of their perceptions of national economic performance, both in the past (retrospective sociotropic) and the future (prospective sociotropic). The type of voting that is cued depends on whether or not an incumbent is running, and therefore a reliable place to point blame. Essentially, the reward-punishment hypothesis holds up across settings, with slight variation according to group membership (party id, gender, etc.), institutional context (voting system, prime-minister v. president, number of parties) and economic context (personal, neighborhood, national).\n\n\nFindings:\n\nUnited States:\n\nANES is good source for election studies\nMost theories of economic voting focus on the U.S.\nPocketbook voting is weak in presidential elections -- sociotropic is strong\nStrength of economic voting can cary based on context -- such is the case when considering the attribution of responsibility (e.g. the attribution of blame to particular party/candidate/branch of government)\n\nin the U.S. the presidency is an important institutional context for which to blame punish electorally\n\nWhile other types of factors matter and interact them, sociotropic economic effects (both retrospective and prospective) themselves cannot be understated when assessing the general behavior of the voter population.\n\n\n\nBritain:\n\nBES is a good source for election studies\nBritish voters show the same trends of reward and punishment regarding economic voting\nThere may be important regional contexts\n\nJohnston 1997 finds that when voter’s perceptions of their neighborhoods are that they are worse off, they will punish the incumbent\n\nRetrospective and Prospective are both important\nPerceptual shifts in economic conditions are almost as great as realigning with a different party (Clarke et al. 2004)\n\n\n\nFrance:\n\nEurobarometer and FNES are good sources for election studies\nA general finding—significant retrospective sociotropic effects, but no retrospective pocketbook effects\nIt is largely sociotropic and more or less equally retrospective or prospective, depending in part on the institutional context.\nThe French voter is sophisticated, knowing whom and how much to blame.\n\nWhen government is unified, the president is the lightning rod for economic discontent. However, under cohabitation, the burden shifts to the prime minister.\n\nSmaller parties are blamed less than large parties, legislative candidates are blamed less than presidential candidates, and presidential candidates who are prime minister are blamed more than presidential candidates who are not prime minister.\n\n\n\nCross-National Studies:\n\nSimilar trends have been found in cross-national studies\n\nLewis‐Beck and Mitchell (1990), on the five major western European countries; Chappell and Veiga (2000), on thirteen western European nations; Pacek (1994) and Tucker (2001) on central European samples; Remmer (1991) on twelve Latin American countries; Pacek and Radcli (1995) on eight low‐income nations; Wilkin, Haller, and Norporth (1997) on a worldwide sample of countries.\n\nImportant Takeaways:\n\nResponsibility Hypothesis seems to hold - that when responsibility is hard to pin down, voters are less likely to punish incumbents - this is an important contextual factors\n\nSuch is the case in more countries with more “coalitional complexity” -- when more parties make up the incumbent government, is it difficult to assign blame\nPresidential Systems and systems with more restrictive electoral laws tend to strengthen the economic vote\nIn the context of globalization, there is a significant decrease in economic voting in the face of open trade, as electorates can’t assign blame to the government alone"

    "section": "Parametric vs. Non-Parametric models",
    "text": "Parametric vs. Non-Parametric models\nOur goal is to use data to estimate f(x) (this is the line or true relationship). We want to find a function \\(\\hat{f}\\) such that \\(Y\\approx \\hat{f}(\\textbf{X})\\) for any observation (X, Y). So how do we estimate f(X) (the line/relationship)? We can use either a parametric or non-parametric approach/model. Up until now, I have only been taught parametric (this being linear regression, etc.).\nSo which is better, parametric or non-parametric? The answer is simple: the parametric approach will outperform the non-parametric approach if the parametric form that has been selected is close to the true form of \\(f\\).\n\nParametric Methods\n\nWe make an assumption about the functional form, or shape of f (the function/line). Usually this assumption is that \\(f\\) is linear.\nWe then need to fit or train the model. This means we need to estimate the parameters (\\(\\beta_1,\\beta_2,...,\\beta_p\\)).\n\nthe most common approach and the one we have been trained extensively is ordinary least squares (OLS).\n\nOLS is one of the many possible ways to fit the linear model\n\nWe use OLS because when the assumptions are met, it is BLUE.\n\n\n\nOne potential downside of a parametric approach is that the model we choose will usually not match the true unknown form of \\(f\\).\n\nwe want to be careful about over-fitting the data.\n\nthis means they follow the errors, or noise, too closely.\nthis is bad because your model will struggle to estimate responses on new observations that were not part of the original training data set.\n\n\nMaybe the true relationship has some curvature (it isn’t linear) but the linear model we create gets us reasonably close to describing the relationship between the X and Y variables.\n\n\n\nNon-Parametric Methods\n\nWe do not make assumptions about the functional form of \\(f\\).\n\nnon-parametric approaches estimate \\(f\\) as close to the data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly\n\nlower residuals\n\n\nOne major disadvantage of non-parametric approaches is that a lot more observations are needed to get an accurate estimate for \\(f\\).\nYou can still over fit a non parametric model.\n\n\n\nPrediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn obvious question that follows is: Why would we ever chose a more restrictive method instead of a very flexible approach? Wouldn’t more flexibility get us closer to the true \\(f\\)?\n\nrestrictive models are easier to interpret\n\nthe relationship is straightforward and easy to understand!\nOLS is not only really good (it is the best when assumptions are met) but it is super easy to interpret.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervised versus Unsupervised Learning\n\nSupervised\n\nPretty much all the models I have used thus far (and listed prior) use supervised learning.\n\neach observation of the predictor measurement has an associated response measurement for \\(x_i\\) there is an associated \\(y_i\\) value.\n\nGoal: prediction and inference (both involve modeling the relationship between predictors and outcome of interest)\nThe goal of supervised learning is to learn a predictive model that maps features of the data (e.g. house size, location, floor type, …) to an output (e.g. house price). If the output is categorical, the task is called classification, and if it is numerical, it is called regression.\n\n\n\nUnsupervised\n\nMore challenging\nnot focused on in this workshop.\nGoal: search for simple structure underlying data set (what are the relationships between variables)\nYou have a bunch of dependent variables and you think there is some cause underlying them. We are trying to back out an X.\nfor every observation we observe a vector of measurements \\(x_i\\) but no associated response \\(y_i\\)\n\nlike going in blind\n\ncalled unsupervised because we lack a response variable that can supervise our analysis.\nOne type is called cluster analysis.\n\n\n\nSemi-supervised learning\n\nmore rare\nkind of in between the two.\ndon’t worry about this, we don’t go over it."

This balance is the bias-variance trade off.\nWhen we are estimating \\(f\\), we don’t want to ignore true nonlinear complexities, but we also want parsimonious models of social/behavioral phenomena that generalize well.\nOur estimated function \\(\\hat{f}\\) should be an approximation to \\(f\\) (i.e., the true data generating process) that minimizes bias and variance.\nThis is referred to as a trade-of because it is easy to obtain a method with extremely low bias but high variance (for instance, by drawing a curve that passes through every single training observation) or a method with very low variance but high bias (by ftting a horizontal line to the data). The challenge lies in finding a method for which both the variance and the squared bias are low.\n\n\nVariance\n\nVariance refers to the amount by which \\(\\hat{f}\\) would change if we estimated it using a different training data set.\n\nremember that we are trying to estimate \\(f\\) using our sample. There is uncertainty around it. Different data may give us a different \\(\\hat{f}\\).\n\nWe can use one sample to estimate the variance around the estimate.\n\nthis of course is called Standard Error. If a method has high variance then small changes in the training data can result in large changes in \\(\\hat{f}\\).\n\n\n\nIn general more flexible statistical methods have higher variance.\n\n\n\nBias\n\nrefers to the coefficient.\nAs a general rule, as we use more flexible methods, the variance will increase and the bias will decrease.\nOverfitting a model reduces the bias as much as possible at the expense of variance.\nDoes our estimate \\(\\approx\\) the true population estimate"

What is it?\n\nCross-validation explanation\n\nRandomly divide the available set of samples into two parts: a training set and a test or hold-out set.\n\nkeep 80% of the data for training and then use 20% of the data for testing\n\nthis ratio can range. Could use 70-30, 50-50, etc.\n\n\nEstimate the model using the remaining of the data.\n\nApply the model to the observations in that subset, generating predictions \\((\\hat{Y}_{test}=\\hat{f}(X_{test}))\\) and residuals \\(Y_{test}-\\hat{Y}_{test}\\) to estimate testing error.\n\nOne issue in doing this: we lose data.\n\nMaybe we have very little data…we don’t want to give up some of that data!

Every additional independent variable we include increases the space exponentially: the space that we’re operating in for DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV3 is exponentially larger than DV ~ IV1 + IV2.\n\nAnd so we’ll end up in cases where we don’t have observations in unique combinations of IV1, 2, and 3. A parametric model, like OLS, will fit a line through the middle of the space (to minimize error) but it will end up giving us predictions for observations that don’t exist\n\ne.g., if we are predicting vote choice using race (white, black, Asian) and partisanship (democrat, independent, republican), if we have 1,000 observations we should observe every combination of those IVs. However, if we add additional covariates, like income, gender, state of residence etc., we are likely to end up with situations where we have no observations with a given combination of covariate values (e.g., perhaps we have no black, female, republicans who make &gt;$100k, and live in Alaska)\n\nThis is a problem ML field cares about but the political science field does not give this issue much attention (they should)."

    "text": "Pattie, Charles, and Ron Johnston. 2000. “People Who Talk Together Vote Together: An Exploration of Contextual Effects in Great Britain.” Annals of the Association of American Geographers 90(1): 41-66.\n\nAbstract:\nMany students of British voting patterns have tested for the existence of contextual effects, which postulate that voters are influenced by events and people in their local milieux. One of those contextual effects is the neighborhood effect, whereby individuals are influenced by the nature of the politically relevant information circulating within their social networks, many of which are spatiallyconstrained to their local area. Although ecological analyses have identified patterns consistent with this hypothesis, there have been virtually no direct investigations of the effect, largely because of the absence of relevant data. Using information from a large, clustered survey of voters at the time of the 1992 general election, this paper uncovers clear evidence of such effects: people are much more likely to change their votes in a particular direction if those with whom they discuss political issues support that direction, especially if they are members of the respondent’s family and are the individuals with whom they discuss politics most.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nWho we talk to is as important as who we are and who we talk to is very much influenced by where we live — we are what we are, and do what we do, because of where we are, and have been OR those who talk together tend to vote together.\n\n\nResearch Question:\nDoes the neighborhood effect have an impact on voter decisions?\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nMost researchers have accepted that voters are influence by their immediate social and geographical environments as well as their own individual circumstances. However, the way in which such contextual factors operate is contested. Most explanations point to spatial variation in economic and political contexts and the driving force behind voter’s decisions. That is, “nonsocial” context on economic and political conditions at the local and national level compose the voting repertoire with which individuals draw on at the polls.\nHowever, the authors speculate that the influence of immediate social networks (family, friends, colleagues) on individual opinions informs their voting behavior. Early research explored such possibilities, but scarcity of data left this “neighborhood effect” to be abandoned if favor of explanations that could be explored.\n\n\nHypothesis:\nMain hypothesis: Each group would be influenced by the dominant nature of electorally relevant information in their social networks—those who changed the party that they supported should be in networks where support for their new party is strong, whereas those who remained loyal to a party should be in networks that give it strong support.\n\n\nData/Methods:\n\nExplores contextual effects on voting behavior in Great Britain\nUses data collected in the British Election Study (BES) from the 1992 British General Election, which lends itself to the data requirement of networks of people living in the same locality.\n\nThe data uses a cluster rather than a random sample: 210 “points” (which are polling districts made up of 1,000-2,000 voters).\nUsed a stratified random design with a random sample of respondents selected from the electoral roll for the district\nProduces 2,526 individuals with an average sample size of around 16 per cluster, with a peaked distribution between 16 and 19\n\nAuthors chose to focus on why some respondents, from their own recollection, changed their vote between 1987 and 1992 while others did not\nBy aggregating the reported 1987 votes of each BES respondent by polling district, the authors were able to estimate the vote share there for each of the three main political parties that fought in all British constituencies in both 1987 and 1992: Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat (Alliance in 1987).\nFirst analysis:\n\nContrasts those who switched their vote to a particular party in 1992 (coded 1) against those who didn’t (coded 0)\nGives 3 dependent variables:\n\n1. switch to conservative 2) switch to labor 3) switch to Liberal\n\nEmploys a Logistic Regression (because the DVs are binary)\nThen does the same thing but looks at those who defected (voted for each party in 1987) So those who voted for a particular party in 1987 and again in 1992 (the loyalists) against those that voted for another party/ didn’t vote at all in 1992 (the defectors)\n\nSecond analysis:\n\nlooks at the impact of conversations with the individuals respondents named as the first (primary) discussant of politics and analyzing how that affected transitions to each party\nMeasures those who who didn’t vote for the same party in 1992 as they did in 1987 against those who did\nAlso looks at those who defected versus those who didn’t\n\nThird analysis:\n\nAssesses the degree to which cross cutting relationships impact vote choice by bringing in two additional discussants that the respondents listed\nThe more discussants who support a particular party, the greater the expected probability that an individual will switch to that party, and the less the probability that he or she will defect from it.\n\nFourth analysis:\n\nIt’s possible that discussants don’t live in the same neighborhood (i.e. context) as the respondent. Therefore, there a chance that political context and conversations on voting linked, or could they be separate?\nhypothesize that the more support a party has in a locality (the independent variables employed in the regressions reported in Tables 3 and 4), the greater the probability that individuals there will encounter, talk to, and be converted by that party’s partisans\ntested by dividing the respondents according to how many discussants they report having a particular partisanship, which can vary from 0 to 3.\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nSocial networks are indeed important influences on voting decisions\n\nFamilies who talk together, vote together! (kinda) - voters were more likely to vote/not vote for a party based on conversations they had with their families\nMore accurately: those who talked together tended to vote together.\nConversations with friends are also important\n\nFirst analysis:\n\nthe more their local area was dominated by supporters of a particular party, the greater the probability that individuals switched their support to that party between 1987 and 1992—if they had not voted for it at the first of those two election\nlocal context did not influence voters’ decisions to abandon a party they have previously supported, but that the choice of which party to switch their support to was influenced by local conditions—which is the hypothesized mechanism that underlies the neighborhood effect.\n\nSecond analysis:\n\nThose who did not voter conservative in 1987 were more likely to vote conservative in 1992 if their primary discussant was conservative\n\ntalking to Labour or Liberal party discussants made not conservative voters less likely to vote conservative (duh)\n\nSame results hold for other parties - voters were more likely to vote for a particular party if the primary discussant was a member of that party\nFrequency of conversation about politics appeared to have no influence\nthose people who voted for a party in 1987 were less likely to vote for another party in 1992 if their primary discussant had been a supporter of the same parter when compared to their discussant being from another party or having no discussant at all\n\nThird analysis:\n\nMore likely to support and less likely to defect if the discussants were from the same party\n\nFourth Analysis:\n\nIf a respondent had more discussants from a particular party, then there was also an associated increase in the number of votes for that party in the respondents district\nThis shows that there is a link between spatial and communicative contexts, supporting the neighboring effects.\n\nIt is not logical to ignore social networks, and conversations within them, as a possible influence on the voting decision of individuals\n\n\n\nNon-Findings:\n\nCan’t distinguish if the influential conversations are locally based\nThey know that the conversations matter, but they have no information on the relative locations of the individuals involved in those conversations (how immediate are they?).\nAlso don’t know what the content of the conversations were"

But if these slow attitudinal changes are happening across the majority of the population, how do we account for democratic backsliding and the rise of violence against minorities in postindustrial countries following exogenous shocks/social strains? (think terrorist attacks, economic shocks like the 2008 recession, mass migration/immigration from Syria, etc.). Do we think that these represent latent variables that were always present? Are they blips along a long-term progressive path? Or do they represent something more insidious?\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nThis book sets out to understand how modernization has changed cultural attitudes toward gender equality and to analyze the political consequences of this process\nCore arguments: people’s lives have been changed in 2-stage modernization process:\n\nShift from agrarian to industrialized societies\nMove from industrial to postindustrial societies\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction – Explaining the Rising Tide of Gender Equality\n\nWomen’s progress worldwide uneven – lagging in government representation\nUN encouraged states to recognize women’s rights through Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 1979\n\n“...the role of the state is now widely understood to be central in actively consolidating and reinforcing gender equality” (7).\n\nCultural barriers: perceptions of appropriate division of roles in home and family, paid employment, and political spere shaped by predominant culture – the social norms, beliefs, and values in society\n\nThes norms, beliefs and values rest on levels of societal modernization and religious traditions\nGender = the socially constructed roles and learned behavior of women and men associated with the biological characteristics of females and males\nCultural change not sufficient itself for gender equality but is a necessary condition for gender equality\n\nModernization brings systematic, predictable changes in gender roles in 2 phases:\n\n\n\nIndustrialization → women into paid workforce → reduced fertility rates, increased literacy and greater educational opportunities → greater female participation in representative government (but still less power than men)\nPostindustrialization → women rise in management and professions → women gain political influence in elected & appointed bodies (over half of women worldwide haven’t entered this phase yet)\n\n\nChanges probabilistic, not deterministic (11)\n\n\n\nChapter 2: From Traditional Roles toward Gender Equality\n\nFour major predictions – expect to find systematic differences in cultural indicators of gender equality:\n\nbetween societies based on their level of economic development\nwithin societies based on generational cohorts\nbetween women and men, and\nwithin societies based on structural and cultural factors such as education and class\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chapter analyzes indirect attitudinal evidence\nThis study develops a Gender Equality Scale by combining 5 items from the pooled 1995-2001 World Values Surveys/European Values Surveys\n\nMENPOL Q118: “On the whole, men make better political leaders than women do.” (Agree coded low) (1990-2001 WVS/EVS)\nMENJOBS Q78: “When jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women.” (Agree coded low) (1990-2001 WVS/EVS)\nBOYEDUC Q119: “A university education is more important for a boy than a girl.” (Agree coded low) (1990-2001 WVS/EVS)\nNEEDKID Q110: “Do you think that a woman has to have children in order to be fulfilled or is this not necessary?” (Agree coded low) (1981-2001 WVS/EVS)\nSGLMUM Q112: “If a woman wants to have a child as a single parent but she doesn’t want to have a stable relationship with a man, do you approve or disapprove?” (1981-2001 WVS/EVS)\n\nPrincipal component factor analysis revealed that all 5 items tap a single dimension (see Table 2.1) w/Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.54*\n\n\nGender Equality Scale summed across items & standardized to 100 points\n\nMean score for postindustrial societies = 80%; 68% for industrial; 60% for agrarian\n\n\nFigure 2.2: plot of logged GDP per cap vs. Gender Equality Scale; R2 = 0.54"

When such is the case, both men and women have an incentive to cultivate their outside options by entering into paid work, and the distribution of unpaid work is determined by bargaining powers dependent upon the political-economic factors outside the family.\nWhat is important is that divorce is an option that varies across contexts. In places where divorce is a more viable, then outside options become important for long-term welfare. Meaning that both sexes will prefer social and economic policies that maximize these options, even if it reduces household income or other measures of aggregate welfare.\nMen are disincentivized to support their wives working because 1.) it increases her agency/options to exit the marriage and 2.) increases the amount of work he has to do in the home. Additionally, women in specific skills economies typically bear a bigger penalty for career interruptions such as for child rearing, they face more limited work opportunities and may invest less in their market-relevant education as a result. This, in turn, weakens their bargaining power at home, and they get stuck sweeping floors more of the time than their counterparts in economies that specialize in general skills. This occurs unless the government steps in and adopts policies to counter the disadvantages of women in specific skills countries. This is where the gender gap in preferences enters the story."

    "text": "Lyons, J., Utych, S.M. 2023. “You’re Not From Here!: The Consequences of Urban and Rural Identities.” Political Behavior 45: 75–101.\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Rural and Urban identities exist and influence preferences in predictable ways”\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nTo what extent do urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race?\nAre these identities consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world?\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nAs the American political landscape becomes increasingly divided along urban–rural lines, it raises the prospect of deepening social identities that are tied to one’s community-type. As community-type becomes an important social identity, it can lead to favoritism of one’s community in-group, or denigration of one’s community out-group. We explore the extent to which urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race, and whether they are consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world. Using national survey data, we demonstrate that people in both urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors which are correlated with the urban–rural divide. We use two different experiments to assess the consequences of this identity, finding that there are distinct effects in the political arena when allocating government resources, and in the non-political world when judging hypothetical job applications. These effects are generally smaller in magnitude than other factors, such as partisanship, but suggest that community-type identities are important in politics.\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nLyons and Utych set out to assess what appears to be a growing divide between rural and urban party affiliation and voting patterns.They explore the extent to which people use information about rural and urban community types to form impressions about American politics, as well as how people use this information to make decisions about political and non-political matters. If people are using urban and rural identities in similar ways to partisanship, and partisanship uses group identity as a way of perceiving the world, then there is a chance that people may be using geographic information such as urban and rural community type to evaluate the political and interpersonal landscape around them.\nThey focus on discriminatory behaviors. If urban and rural community types are taking on the qualities of social identities, then the in-group and out-group processing of information along lines of community type should be salient. That is, those from urban (rural) locations should confer a preference to urban (rural) locations/people, and a penalty to rural (urban) locations/people when making decisions that allocate resources, benefits, or opportunities.\n\n\nData/Methods:\nUses three different studies\n\n\nFirst Study:\n\nFirst, uses National Survey Data to show that people perceive values differences between people who live in rural and urban places -- appear to be driven by more than just party or race\n\ndo people who live in rural (urban) areas think that people who live in urban (rural) places are different than them, and do they think that they are getting an unfair shake from government relative to those who live in other community types?\nPew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (Wave 32)\nOrdered logit\n\n\n\nIV:\nwhether the respondents live in urban or rural setting\n\n\nDV:\n\nperceptions of others values\n\nused by creating a dichotomous variable from three survey questions (p.80)\n\nperceptions of government distribution of resources across community types\n\nalso created a dichotomous variable from survey questions (p.84-85)\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Study:\n\nSecond, uses a conjoint experiment to explore where urban or rural identities are consequential for how people distribute resources in a hypothetical political scenario\n\nconducted on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in July 2019.7 We recruited 572 respondents to participate in the study, who were paid $1.25 to participate in a study that took less than 10 min, on average.\n\nover representative of young, liberal, white, educated, male\nFirst, participants were provided a sample pairing of two cities, to familiarize themselves with the task. Participants were told they were in charge of allocating $50,000 in highway funding between two cities. These cities were randomly assigned to vary on three dimensions—location (urban, suburban, or rural), mayor partisanship (Republican, Democrat, or non-partisan), year of last investment (2006, 2012, or 2018), percentage African-American (5%, 20%, or 65%) and average household income ($30,000, $60,000, or $90,000). Each individual completed the practice trial, and then 15 test trials.\nkey variation is based on the “location” variation, allowing us to compare how individuals allocate funding between urban, suburban, and rural areas.\nOne observation for each trial includes city characteristics for City A, while the second observation includes city characteristics for City B.\n\n\n\n\nD.V.\n\nthe allocation decision between City A or City B, which takes a value of 1 if the respondent allocates funding to that city, and 0 if they allocate funding for the other city.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nFind that rural identities influence opinions and that partisans react to urban and rural information in expected ways\nFind that Democrats are more likely prefer urban areas to suburban areas, but not difference in the allocation of resources between Urban and Rural Republicans, however, are more likely to allocate to rural areas\nNo location based preferences for rural respondents\n\n\n\n\nThird Study:\n\nThird, uses a resume experience to test discrimination in a non-political setting, finding that people evaluate hypothetical job applicants more favorably when they are from the same community types\n\nrecruited 1467 respondents via MTurk who live in urban or rural areas13 to participate in the study, who were paid $0.50 to participate in a study that took roughly 2.5 min to complete, on average.\nParticipants shown a hypothetical resume and then asked to rate the applicant on a series of evaluative criteria/ traits\nparticipants had preference for co-location\n\n\n\nExpectations:\n\nurban and rural identities are formative for the way in which people view themselves and others, and it is in ways that go above and beyond race, partisanship, and other demographic or socioeconomic factors\nDemocrats should discriminate in a fashion that confers favor to urban locations or people, while Republicans should show a preference for rural locations or people.\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nBoth urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors\nEach identity has a distinct impact on the political arenas when is comes to allocating government resources\nAlso has an impact in the non-political world when judging job applications\nEffects are smaller than other factors, such as partisanship\nLess educated community residents are more likely to perceive values difference\n\nIn rural places, so are younger people, males, whites, liberals, and non-religious service attenders\nresults are particularly related to rural areas\n\nFor government resources\n\nPeople who are older, more educated, Republicans and very conservative are the most likely to believe that urban area get more than their fair share of resources. By far the largest effect is from ideology (0.57 change in predicted probability across the full range), with partisanship (0.47 change in predicted probability) and age (0.22 change in predicted probability) also resulting in meaningful changes in predicted probabilities.\n\nurban residents appear to have a well-defined out group, but it isn’t rural areas, it is the suburbs"

Ch. 37: 693-707.\n\nBumper Sticker:\nWhat does the political science literature discuss in relation to social movements and Democracy?\n\n\nClassical Perspective:\nThese theories might be problematic because of ideological differences in the actual social movements and the scholars who studied them. (the scholars didn’t like the social movements so that is why their theories are rather dismissive of the people that make them up.)\n\nPre 1960 Perspective - In social movements, people lose their individuality and become susceptible to irrational behavior, which may include great bravery and sacrifice for the group, but also uncontrolled violence towards outsiders. Mostly negative view of social movements. \n\n“Crowd-psychological ideas” - Max Weber (charismatic leadership), Emile Durkheim (collective conscience), Gustave Le Bon. \n\nAdorno perspective - “In search for new social anchors, the uprooted and isolated individuals of mass society were seen as easy targets for totalitarian mass movements of the left and right. Such movements were moreover seens as attracting particular types of ‘authoritarian’ personalities.”\n\nMotivated by theories of “mass society”\nRapid social change was seen as breaking down traditional social ties and norms.\n\nTheories of Relative Deprivation - gap between what people get and what they expect and aspire to get on the basis of past trends and comparisons with other groups.\n\nDeprivation leads to frustration and striking out at perceived sources of anger.\n\n\n\n\nResource Mobilization Perspective:\n1960s radical movements changed everything. Mancur Olson’s economic theory of collective action changes everything.\n\nMancur Olson perspective - social movements were interpreted as rational, utility maximizing actors, and new vocabulary. \n\nBasically rat choice.\nEmphasized group solidarity and the integration of individuals into social networks rather than breakdown of social norms and social uprootedness. Not just a bunch of isolated weirdos. - KEY DIFFERENCE FROM CLASSICAL PERSPECTIVE.\nProblems with it: downplays context and just typical issues with rat choice.\n\n\n\n\nPolitical Opportunity Structure Perspective:\nWant more focus on external factors in shaping social movements. Mobilization + classical theories focused on internal factors.\n\nPolitical opportunity structures - argue that variations in the amount and types of social movement activity can be explained by variations in the political context that they confront. \n\nSocial movement structure/existence is related to factors such as electoral volatility, composition of party system, inst. Centralization, separation of powers, political elites.\nContrast French protests to Swiss protests. French are bigger because of more centralization.\nStill problematic - diminishes the conception of agency. Opportunities are not decided by external factors but creative individuals that set the plan/agenda. \n\n\n\n\nEvolutionary Model Perspective:\nFocus on interplay of movement-external (environmental selection) and internal (variation/innovation and retention/diffusion) elements.\n\nNew model.\nDoes not require strong assumptions about cognitive or psychological mechanisms that generate strategic decisions of movement activists and their opponents.\nBridge between agency-orientated and structural perspective within social movement research."

Is this the case? Are there examples of VPOs led by women?\nThere also appears to be an assumption that women participate in VPOs for rational reasons such as being victimized, fighting for increased political rights, etc. Outside of Islamic fundamentalism, are there other ways in which women can be radicalized to participate in violence that the study fails to control for?\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nMost studies ignore women’s participation in VPOs\nIf they do examine this phenomenon, it’s through case studies or small-N studies, and focused on “supply-side” dynamics (what characteristics condition women towards violence) rather then “demand-side” dynamics (ways in which different organizational preferences & behaviors work to facilitate or impede women’s presence in VPOs)\n\n“Women’s voluntary participation in violent politics is tied invariably to the availability of opportunities” (489)\n\n3 assumptions:\n\n\nRecruiter and female participants choose purposefully among action alternatives to maximize benefits and minimize costs (everyone thinks like an economist)\nEach organization’s ability to succeed depends on ability to attract and retain members willing to engage in violence\nTo be successful, leaders must be able to persuade potential members to overcome collective action problems while frustrating opponents’ ability to do the same\n\n\nReasons for why women join VPOs mimic reasons why individuals join; that is, they are not particular to women\n\nSupply-side reasons alone not enough to explain variation in participation between men and women in VPOs\n\nCase study: Eritrea (1961-1991) and their war for independence\n\nELF included marginal number of women and mostly in support roles\nEPLF split from ELF & included women in all aspects of org throughout its existence\nAfter victory in war with ELF and major gains in war against Ethiopia, EPLF saw flood of women’s participation\n\nEPLF instrumental in establishment of National Union of Eritrean Women (NUEW) in 1979\nRemained committed to women’s participation"

Instead, the authors explore the content of these events. The goal of the paper is to check the plausibility of tentative thesis - that mass violence can be perceived through a rationalist framework\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nTraditional explanations for why insurgent groups choose to engage is mass violence have focused primarily on ideology as the main explanatory factor. The authors argue that, counter to traditional accounts, mass violence against civilians is strategic with aims of maximizing civilian support. They sketch a theoretical framework for the analysis of civil wars to see how it fares in one particular case: insurgent violence in Algeria. \n\n\nMethod/Finding:\n\nFocus on insurgent violence in Algeria in 1996 during the civil war, which started in 1992 after the Algerian Military (Incumbents) “aborted” the parliamentary election and terminated democracy \n\nThis deprived the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of a sweeping victory and they eventually become outlawed insurgents that formed into two groups - the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) and the GIA (which is believed to have contributed to most of the Massacres. \n\nGeneralized out to other countries at the end of the paper. \nThey find that Massacres tend to happen under conditions of fragmented rule, support for the incumbent state, and escalating violence.\nThey were not random, but attacked specific neighborhoods\n\nFamilies of sympathizers were left alone \nVictims belonged to three groups\n\nLocal opponents who supported incumbents \nPeople supporting competing insurgent groups \nFormer sympathizers who switched allegiance (most targeted this group)\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nMassacre\n\nDefined narrowly as large-scale, face-to-face violence against civilians targeted in groups and in the context of a civil war.\n\nViolence\n\nMeasure in it most basic form: homicide"

To address this issue, this research aims to differentiate between the two.\n\nconflation of tolerance with prejudice has made it difficult to understand what tolerance truly means and how it differs from dislike or disapproval of certain groups.\ndistinguishing analytically between tolerance and prejudice. \ndefine tolerance as an abstract value orientation towards diversity, without focusing on specific groups, ideas, or behaviors. This allows authors to analyze tolerance both within societies and across different societies.\nsuggests that tolerance is best understood as a three-dimensional concept, involving acceptance of, respect for, and appreciation of difference.\nfound that only an appreciation of difference has the potential to reduce prejudice.\n\ndemonstrates the validity of these measures and their independence from welfare attitudes. \nResults suggest that only an appreciation of difference can reduce prejudice, but relationship btwn tolerance/other outcomes remain unclear.\n\n\nThere are two main approaches to studying tolerance. \n\nThe first sees tolerance as permitting something disliked, suggesting that prejudice is necessary for tolerance. \n\nThis view implies that one can only be tolerant if they’ve been prejudiced before. Empirical studies following this approach often start with the assumption that certain groups are widely disliked.\nHowever, this method makes it hard to separate tolerance from prejudice in practice.\n\nThe second approach defines tolerance as a positive response to diversity itself, without requiring prior prejudice. \n\nThis view focuses on subjective reactions to diverse values, behaviors, and lifestyles. \nAlthough this conceptualization is analytically distinct from prejudice, previous studies using this definition still rely on measures of prejudice, limiting our understanding of tolerance.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth approaches have methodological issues. They either link tolerance closely to prejudice or fail to measure tolerance in a way consistent with its definition. \n\nAdditionally, previous research has often overlooked the multidimensionality of tolerance and lacks abstraction in its conceptualization and measurement. \nTo address these limitations, the study advances a new conception of tolerance and develops measures consistent with this definition, avoiding the pitfalls of previous approaches.\npropose a new understanding of tolerance as a value orientation towards difference, which focuses on how individuals respond to diversity itself rather than merely putting up with disliked aspects. \nThis definition is abstract and distinct from previous concepts, not requiring the identification of objectionable groups or behaviors. \n\ndraw on Forst’s dimensions of tolerance: \n\nAcceptance\nrespect for difference\nappreciation of difference.\n\nThese dimensions represent different levels of engagement with diversity, ranging from basic acceptance to a deeper appreciation. \nthis approach allows for the measurement of various expressions of tolerance without relying on specific groups or behaviors, making our measures politically and temporally neutral. \nThis framework provides a clearer understanding of tolerance and facilitates its empirical investigation.\n8 positively worded items were selected to capture three dimensions of tolerance: acceptance, respect, and appreciation. \n\n\nDescriptive statistics show moderate to high levels of tolerance among respondents"

Levy, Eds., The Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology, 2nd edition. Oxford University Press.\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Experiences during early childhood are largey  responsible for partisan predispositions and political leanings in adult life” \n\n\nPurpose:\nThis chapter examines the life histories of political orientations as they evolve from early childhood through old age.\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nSears and Brown (2013) employ a life history perspective (framework) to understanding how political orientations evolve across the human lifespan. The use of this framework provides some helpful insights: \n\nIs addresses the constant tension between continuity and change as played out throughout an individuals lifespan\nIt helps us to understand the origins of orientations that are politically consequential among adults, whether concerning politics specifically or intergroup relations. \n\n\n\nFindings:\nThis review has suggested that partisan predispositions are most likely to be acquired in early development, if not quite as uniformly early as originally thought.\n\n\n\nThe authors suggest that this is due the role of “time” which is treated as an independent variable that takes three forms\n\nThe persisting effects of early experiences\nThe major events or “the times” that characterize the environment an individual has experienced \nThe life stages of development - children, adolescents, adults all have different cognitive capabilities \n\nBased on the various ways fo thinking about time, the authors pose four alternative models of the full political life cycel that are often contrasted in the literature and which speak to Campbell’s conception of party identification being shaped by early learning behavior, persistence, and later influence on voting behavior. \n\nfour alternative models of the full political life cycle have often been contrasted: \n(1) persistence: the residues of preadult learning persist through life; \n(2) a variant, impressionable years: orientations are particularly susceptible to influence in late adolescence and early adulthood, but tend to stabilize thereafter\n(3) its major alternative, lifelong openness: individuals remain open to influence throughout later life, including by “the times”\n(4) life cycle: people show distinctive specific propensities at different stages of life (this one is particularly difficult to pin down)\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nThe Life-History Perspective\n\na theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Things:\n\n\n\nThe life history perspective of political development is a theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time. This perspective views political development as akin to the life cycle of an organism, with distinct stages of growth, maturation, decline, and potential renewal.\n\n\n\nKey features of the life history perspective of political development include:\n\n\n\nStages of Development: Similar to biological life cycles, political systems are seen to progress through various stages of development. These stages may include periods of consolidation, expansion, crisis, and transformation. Each stage is characterized by specific challenges, opportunities, and dynamics.\nAdaptation to Environmental Pressures: Just as organisms adapt to their environments to survive and thrive, political systems must adapt to changing societal, economic, and environmental conditions. This may involve institutional reforms, policy adjustments, or shifts in political strategies to address new challenges or opportunities.\nResource Allocation and Trade-offs: The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resource allocation and trade-offs in political development. Political systems must allocate scarce resources, such as financial capital, human capital, and political capital, among competing priorities and objectives. Decisions about resource allocation may have long-term implications for the trajectory of political development.\nReproduction and Inheritance: Political systems often inherit institutional legacies, cultural norms, and social structures from previous generations. These inherited traits shape the opportunities and constraints faced by contemporary political actors and influence the trajectory of political development. Similarly, political systems may reproduce themselves through processes of institutional continuity, elite reproduction, and socialization.\nVariation and Diversity: Just as biological organisms exhibit variation and diversity within and across species, political systems display variation and diversity in their structures, institutions, and practices. The life history perspective recognizes that different political systems may follow distinct trajectories of development due to historical legacies, cultural norms, and contextual factors.\nAdaptive Responses to External Shocks: Political systems may face external shocks and disruptions, such as economic crises, wars, or natural disasters, that necessitate adaptive responses. The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resilience and flexibility in responding to external shocks and maintaining political stability and legitimacy.\n\nPartisanship is apparently a really salient predictor of mate choice lol"

    "text": "Tajfel, Henri. 1982. “Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations.” Annual Review of Psychology 33(1): 1-39.\nAWFUL READ! NEVER WRITE A LIT REVIEW LIKE THIS GUY!!!!\nI did my best to try to take the major themes of each section but he just throws every possible research paper on the subject at you. Literally a whirlwind of information.\n\nIntroduction:\nIntergroup behavior: “Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, collectively or individually, with another group or its members in terms of their group identification, we have an instance of intergroup behavior.”\n\n\nWhat is a group?:\n\nexternal : outside designations. Ex - bank clerks, hospital patients, etc.\nInternal: “group identification” \n\nTo achieve “identification” \n\ncognitive - awareness and membership \nEvaluative one - awareness is related to some value connotation\nEmotional investment in awareness and evaluations. \n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Process in Intergroup Behavior:\n\nFrom Individual to Group Impressions\n\nHow cognitive structures determine certain aspects of intergroup attitudes.\n\nWe are trying to understand cognitive processes and relate it to interpersonal behavior.\n\nDiscussion of stereotypes \n\nCognitive mechanism: since members of minority groups often represent “infrequent” stimuli and therefore a conjunction of their relatively rare appearance with some of their actions lends itself to the construction of “illusionary correlations” and thus to stereotyping.” \n\nSolo status research: When an individual is not part of the group or they are “solo” (think Black man with a group of white men), the Black man will have polarized evaluations compared with evaluations of the same person identified as belonging to the majority group. Aka more variation in view of Black man from white colleagues compared to less variation in view of white guy by white colleagues. \n\nNote: this is not equal across group identities. Some groups still face this issue more than others when the group is mixed. Seems kind of like a primitive concept of intersectionality being developed. \n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Membership and Intergroup Behavior\n\nThe Scope and range of Ethnocentrism\n\nSumner coins term\n\nAlso develops ingroup/outgroup\nArgues ethnocentrism is universal\n\nNot exactly true \n\nGenerates questions that ask about conditions that give rise to ethnocentrism \n\nIn sum, “which differences are emphasized under what circumstances appears to be flexible and context dependent; this flexibility permits individuals to mobilize different group identities for different purposes.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Development of Ethnocentrism\n\nLots of debate \nChildren adopt status + image of their group from outgroup (sometimes) \n\nTension between status development from perception of both ingroup and outgroup\n\nThe growth of group self respect in underprivileged minorities, closely related to socioeconomic, political, and psychological changes both inside the group and outside of it, would result in a corresponding decrease of ingroup devaluations and of low comparative expectancies. \n\nLong process. \nSociopsych transformation is the effect of socioeconomic and political change. \n\n\nIntergroup Conflict and Competition\n\nInterpersonal and intergroup behavior\n\nTwo different approaches \n\nThe “interpersonal extreme” defined as interaction between two or more individuals which is very largely determined by their individual characteristics and the nature of the personal relations between them - Deutsch\nThe “intergroup extreme” defined as interactions which are largely determined by group memberships of the participants and very little-if at all-by their personal relations or individual characteristics. - sherif \n\n\nIntergroup conflict and group cohesion\n\nDoes conflict promote greater cohesion inside the groups engaged in it? At the limit, can conflict create a cohesive group where only a loose structure existed before? \n\nYes, but conditions. \n\nWhat happens if all members of a group are not equally affected by the conflict?\nOr when the consensus about threat, when it is dubious, cannot be transformed by the leadership into an “authoritatively enforced cohesion”?\nOr if a group is unable to deal with threat or to provide emotional support? \n\n\nThere is a connection between in group cohesion and intergroup conflict\n\nPower and status in intergroup behavior \n\nInitially a peripheral focus in the field. But gaining steam. Four research trends \n\nFunctioning of minorities\nThe experimentally induced effects of intergroup power relations \nThe effects of status on intergroup attitudes \nRole played in intergroup behavior by the perceived illegitimacy and/or instability of social differentials. \n\n\n\nSocial categorization and intergroup behavior \n\nSocial categorization: cognitions, values, and groups \n\nStereotypes are categorization.\n\nCognitive function: resulting in the accentuation of similarities and differences, was the utilization of the category membership of individual items for ordering, systematizing, and simplifying the complex network of social groups confront individuals in their social environment\nValue functionL resulted in a still more emphatic accentuation of these same, similarities and differences when they were associated with subjective value differentials applying to social categories. \n“As a result of the categorization process, within-group differences become minimized and between-group differences become exaggerated”\n\nSalience of identity? \n\nThe value and cognitive functions of social accentuation provide a basis for the understanding of the structure and direction of biases in intergroup attitudes and stereotypes, but they cannot tell us very much about the contents of the groups’ reciprocal conceptions. \n\n\nSocial categorization and intergroup discrimination\n\nBoys and holiday camp experiment. Once boys found out about other groups existence they started to form ingroup-outgroup identities before anything started. \n\nWhat are the minimal conditions that would create intergroup discrimination? \n\nCommon fate\n\nSocial identity and social comparison \n\nSocial identity is defined as “the part of the individuals’ self-concept which derives from their knowledge of their membership of a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional significance of that membership.” \n“The social group is seen to function as a provider of positive social identity for its members through comparing itself, and distinguishing itself, from other comparison groups along salient dimensions which have a clear value differential”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reduction of Intergroup Discrimination:\n\n\nIntergroup Cooperation and superordinate Goals \n\nIntergroup cooperation leads to less discrimination than intergroup competition. \n\n\n\nIntergroup Contact\n\nIt is just like one paragraph? IDK not much discussion. \n\nIf you want to know more about this stuff check out more modern literature from Ryan Enos (in my opinion -Stone) \n\n\nMultigroup Membership and “Individualization” of the Outgroup  \n\nTribes provide evidence of this\n\nCrossing of memberships\n\nSome research shows a reduction of discrimination\nThis breaks up the homogeneity of the outgroup."

Ch. 1-3.\n\nBumper Sticker:\nPolitical Participation is important for democracy\n\n\nPreface:\n“The characterization of The Civic Culture as celebrating popular apathy came out of a popular mood that extended into academic circles, which accorded little importance to the policy-making and performances side of democratic government. It overlooked the fact that democracy not only required popular participation but that elected leaders had also to govern, and that governing required obligation, patience, and trust. It was this necessary mix of activism and participation with other important ingredients that The Civic Culture celebrated.” (preface) \n\n\nChapter 1: An Approach to Political Culture:\n\nPolitical culture of democracy and the social structures and processes that sustain it. \n\nA new political world culture is developing. \n\n“Participation explosion”\n\n“What must be learned about democracy is a matter of attitude and feeling, and this is harder to learn”. (p.4) \n\nThe Civic Culture:\n\nCombines modernity with tradition\nA culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permeated change but moderated it\n“The working class could enter into politics and, in a process of trial and error, find the language in which to couch their demands and the means to make them effective” (p.6) - kinda reminds me of historical institutionalism. \nIndividuals are not only oriented to political input, they are also orientated positively to the input structures and the input process. \n\nThe civic culture is a participant political culture in which the political culture and political structure are congruent. P.30 \n\n\nWhat is democratic culture? How does it spread? What attitudes and behaviors must be present to create democracy?\nDemocracy is maintained by an active citizenry. More info, more involvement, and a sense of civic responsibility are essential. \nLooks at 5 countries: United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, and Mexico\n\nA bit concerned about these choices. \nThese countries help escape an American focus - I disagree. \n\nPolitical Culture:\n\nRefers specifically to political orientations - attitudes toward the political system and its various parts, and attitudes towards the role of the self in the system. \nPsychological orientation to social objects. \nWhen we speak of the political culture of a society, we refer to the political system as internalized in the cognitions, feelings, and evaluations of its population. People are inducted into it just as they are socialized into nonpolitical roles and social systems. P.13 \n\nThe political culture of a nation is a particular distribution of patterns of orientation toward political objects among the members of a nation. What are those orientations? (see below) \nPolitical Orientation:\n\nOrientation refers to the internalized aspects of objects and relationships.\nIncludes three types: \n\n1) cognitive orientation - knowledge and belief about political system\n2) affective orientation - feelings about political system \n3) evaluational orientation - judgments and opinions about political objects \n\n\nWe have classified orientation but we now must classify objects of political orientation. \n\nSystem as general object \nInput objects  \nOutput objects \nSelf as object \n\nCharacterizing political culture is done by understanding the various orientations toward the various objects. The types of political culture according to the authors are: \n\nParochial Political Culture\nSubject Political Culture \nParticipant Political Culture \n\n“In the civic culture participant political orientations combine with and do not replace subject and parochial political orientations. Individuals become participants in the political process, but they do not give up their orientations as subjects or parochials.” p.30 \n“Thus attitudes favorable to participation within the political system play a major role in the civic culture, but so do such nonpolitical attitudes as trust in other people and social participation in general. The maintenance of these more traditional attitudes and their fusion with the participant orientations lead to a balanced political culture in which political activity, involvement, and rationality exist but are balanced by passivity, traditionality, and commitment to parochial values.” p.30\nThe connecting link between micro and macro politics is political culture.\nSurvey of 5 nations - 1000 interviews in each country. Interviews take place in 1959. US takes place in 1960\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Patterns of Political Cognition\n\nRecall the classification types of political culture: Parochial, Subject, Participant. \n\nOf the 5 countries - parochial and subject are rare. \n\n\n\nMeasures of cognitive content and processes:\n\nHow much importance is attributed to national and local government\nAwareness and exposure of and exposure to politics and public affairs \nPolitical information adult population possesses \nMeasure of the readiness of these populations to make choices or entertain opinions about political issues and problems.\n\n\n\nThe impact of government: To what extent do the people in these countries perceive government as having an effect on them as individuals? To what extent do they see their lives as related to the activities of governments? \n\nAmericans and British respondents in the great majority perceive an impact of their national and local governments and ascribe high favorability \nGermans are similar but a larger percentage are more skeptical in saying the governments sometime improved conditions \nItalians attribute high favorability to gov \nMinority of Mexicans attribute significance to the government and is skeptical in the benefits of the government. \nFrom the results the authors say: \n\nUS, Britain, German are bulk “allegiants” \nItaly, and mexico (mainly mexico) are majority subject and parochial. \n\nEducation correlated with awareness of the significance of the government\n\nAwareness of politics: Do people pay attention to political and governmental affairs (even campaigns)?\n\nThe civic culture, as we use the term, includes a sense of obligation to participate in political input activities, as well as a sense of competence to participate. \nEducation correlated with higher interest.\n\nHaving information and Opinions: Can people identify national leaders and can people identify cabinet offices or departments at the national level of government? \n\nGermans, English, and Americans have higher well-informed respondents. \nMexico the worst\nExcept italy, low information high opinions are common\nbritish , American, and germans are more cognitively oriented to the input and output of government\n\nMexicans and Italians are alienated and parochial.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Feeling Toward Government and Politics\n\nGeneralized attitudes toward the whole: toward the nation, its virtues, accomplishments,\n\nSystem affect: see above \n\nNational pride \n\n“Speaking generally, what are the aspects of this country that you are most proud of?”\nItalians have more pride in items not related to politics \nAmericans and British had higher rates of indicating government/political/public policy items. \nGermans are less prideful in politics. More prideful in science contributions, economy, and personal virtues. \nMexicans are interested in politics and have high political pride\n\nIs the Mexican revolution responsible?\n\nBetter occupation correlates with more political pride \n\nExcept in germany and Italy \n\nSuggests alienation from system\n\nBoth have fascist past? \n\n\n\n\n\nOutput affect: expectations of treatment by government and police\n\nAttitudes toward the executive/gov affecting respondents. \nIf expected to treat fairly then we expect favorability to government authority from respondent \nRespondents were asked two hypotheticals \n\nMexicans continually are more alienated\nPolice had high favorability…more than government officials - except in mexico. \n\n\nInput affect \n\nFeelings people have about the agencies and processes involved in the election of public officials and enactment of general public policies. \nConcerned with face-to-face communication.\nMeasures:\n\nHow much do respondents report discussing politics \n\nTalking politics is an active form of politics\n\nMass media is passive \n\nAre people becoming more passive in politics? \n\n\nTalking politics also indicates some sense of safety in political communication."

Why do you think this is? How well does this fit with Howard’s hypothesis?\nIs this generalizable? (LOLOLOLOL)\nDo you buy voluntary organization participation as a measure of civil societal health? Why or why not?\nIf you wanted to expand upon this study (or even replicate it), how would you design it differently?\n\n\n\nGeneral Note:\n\nThis book explores how people adapt to a new democracy (looking at post-communist Europe)\n\nSpecifically focused on civil society as crucial part of public space between state and family, and embodied in voluntary organizations\nSeeks to explain why post-communist civil society is weak\n\nPost-Communist Europe\n\nRemarkably low rates of participation in voluntary organizations of civil society\nNon-democratic countries not represented\n2 scholarly approaches:\n\nContemporary political and economic attributes and policies the most important factors explaining and predicting cross-national variation\nCausal variables are legacies of communism – historical/cultural context\n\nSocietal similarities resistant to change even while political institutions have\n\nCase studies\n\nRussia & East Germany\n\nEconomic levels high in East Germany but low in Russia\nPolitical and legal institutions well developed in EG but Russian systems weak and underdeveloped\nBoth societies belong to different cultural and religious civilizations\nSubstantial variation provides maximal analytic leverage for explaining causes of similarly low levels of civic participation\n\n\nThe Organization of the Book\n\nTheory\nEmpirical results\nCausal explanation using 2 different methodological approaches\n\n“Experiential” approach to societal continuity and change = individuals are agents who make choices\nFor societal change to occur and last, 3 factors must take place:\n\n\n\n\nNew institutions must be authoritative and binding.\nInstitutions should build upon existing traditions and culture.\nSeveral decades and generations are needed to change people’s habits and acculturation.\n\n\nCh. 2: 3 main individual-level causal factors that guide empirical analysis:\n\n\nMost post-communist citizens still strongly mistrust and avoid organizations, even now that participation is voluntary.\nMany of the private and informal networks that developed under communism – because of the politicization and state control of the public sphere, as well as the shortage economy – still persist today in an altogether new institutional environment, and they serve as a disincentive for many people to join formal organizations.\nMany post-communist citizens are extremely dissatisfied with the new political and economic system which hasn’t lived up to their hopes and ideals, and their disappointment has caused them to withdraw even further from public activities.\n\n\nCh. 3: conceptual analysis of civil society\n\nLinz & Stepan’s 5 “arenas” of democratization:\n\n\n\nCivil society\nPolitical society\nEconomic society\nThe rule of law\nState bureaucracy\n\nAll of these overlap!\n\nCh. 4: empirical findings that constitute “baseline” of comparison\n\nCountries divided into 3 groups by prior regime type: “older democracies,” “post-authoritarian,” or “post-communist” using 1995-97 World Values Survey\nQuestions asked to respondents about membership in 9 orgs:\n\n\n\nChurch/religious org\nSports/recreational club\nEducational, cultural, or artistic org\nLabor union\nPolitical party or movement\nEnvironmental org\nProfessional association\nCharity org\nOther voluntary org\n\n\nResults show that participation in voluntary organizations is much lower in post-communist countries than in the older democracies and post-authoritarian countries (with exception of labor unions)\n\n\n\nCh. 5-6: causal explanations\nCh. 7: conclusion and wider implications\n\n\n\nChapter 5 – Explaining Organizational Membership: An Evaluation of Alternative Hypotheses\n\nAnalysis of the Post-Communist Organizational Membership Study (PCOMS) survey of 1999 conducted in Russia, Eastern Germany, and Western Germany\nFigure 5.1: divides each of the 3 samples into quintiles based on total household income, showing average number of organizational membership per person\n\nPeople w/higher income levels tend to have higher levels of organizational membership in all 3 societies\n\nFigure 5.2: different education levels within the 3 sampes\n\nCountry-specific education variables recoded to fit a continuum for low, medium, high, and very high\nWith 1 minor exception, increasing levels of education associated with higher levels of organizational membership in all 3 samples\n\nFigure 5.3: results for organizational membership for all 3 samples when grouped by age\n\nUnder 25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65 and over\nWest German sample shows membership at its highest for people 45-54;

Does interethnic engagement differ from intraethnic engagement from the perspective of ethnic conflict? What role do civic organizations play in times of ethnic tensions and why?\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nCivil society organizations (both formal & informal) between ethnic communities reduce probability for ethnic violence.\n\n\n\nData:\nAll reported Hindu-Muslim riots in India 1950-1995 in 6 different cities\n\n\nMethods:\n\nQualitative analysis with process tracing\n\nPaired cases where similar stimuli applied to each and different outcomes observed to argue for causality (controlled comparison)\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nAssociational engagement deters ethnic conflict from devolving into ethnic violence between paired cities in study.\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nThere is an integral link between the structure of civil life in a multiethnic society, on the one hand, and the presence or absence of ethnic violence, on the other.\nInterethnic and intraethnic networks of civic engagement play very different roles in ethnic conflict.\n\nInterethnic networks  are agents of peace b/c they build bridges and manage tensions\nIf communities are organized along only intraethnic lines and interconnections with other communities are very weak/nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely\n\nBoth intraethnic and interethnic civic networks can be further broken down into organized and quotidian types based on whether civic interaction is formal or informal\n\nAssociational forms of engagement = formal civic interaction; business associations, professional organizations, reading clubs, film clubs, sports clubs, NGOs, trade unions, and cadre-based political parties\nEveryday forms of engagement = informal civic interaction; family visits, eating together regularly, joint participation in festivals, allowing children to play together\n\nBoth forms of engagement promote peace; their absence or weakness opens up space for ethnic violence\nAssociational forms more influential\n\n\nIndia as case study: much of India’s associational civic structure put into place in the 1920s as movement against the British with 2 goals:\n\nPolitical independence from the British\nSocial transformation of India\n\n\n\n\nEthnicity, ethnic conflict, and civil society \n\nEthnicity = the set to which religion, race, language, and sect belong as subsets in a broad definition of ascriptive group identities\nEthnic conflict = disagreement between different ethnic groups over resources, identity, patronage, and policies; not necessarily violent\n\nEthnic peace = an absence of violence, not an absence of conflict\n\nCivil society = formal and informal societal groups that engage citizens??\n\nThe puzzle\n\nDespite ethnic diversity, some places remain peaceful while others experience enduring patterns of violence. Why?\n\nThe importance of studying levels of variance in independent variables\nFor this project, all reported Hindu-Muslim riots in India 1950-1995 used\n\nUnit of analysis = towns/cities (disproportionate share of communal violence)\n6 cities selected: 3-riot prone and 3 peaceful, then paired\n\nAligarh & Calicut – population percentage pairing\nHyderabad & Lucknow – 2 controls added; previous Muslim rule and “reasonable cultural similarities”\nAhmedabad & Surat – from same state of Gujarat sharing history, language, and culture but not violence (hard test)\n\n\n\n\nThe arguments linking ethnic conflict and civil society (theory)\n\n“The preexisting local networks of civic engagement between the two communities stand out as the single most important proximate explanation for the difference between peace and violence” (374).\n2 mechanisms connecting civil society and ethnic conflict:\n\nCivic networks often make neighborhood-level peace possible by promoting communication between members of different religious communities\n\nSustained prior interaction or cordiality facilitated this\n\nIf vibrant formal organizations serving the economic, cultural, and social needs of the 2 communities exist, the support for communal peace tends to be strong and more solidly expressed\n\nParadox: rural India has far fewer formal associations and the least amount of violence\nSee Figure 1: relationship between size and civic links\n\nN represents # of persons in a village/city\nK represents # of links that must be made to connect everyone\nFor a given level of civic density (in this case, each person connected to everyone else), K rises faster than N\nK = N(N-1)/2\nAssociations link individuals and communities\n\n\n\nOrganized civic networks that are intercommunal:\n\nBetter withstand exogenous shocks\nConstrain local politicians acting strategically that might try to polarize communities for political gain\nAre less violent\n\nThis argument is probabilistic\n\n\n\nEmpirical evidence\n\nSimilar provocations, different responses:\n\nAligarh – riot-prone, Calicut – peaceful; both 36-38% Muslim\n\n1989-1992, Hindu nationalist agitation to destroy Baburi mosque led to violence across India but outcomes above were different\nIn Calicut, politicians of all parties promoted peace; city-level peace committees provided info and constructed forums for individuals to express anger\nHindu-Muslim civic integration runs deep in Calicut\nAssociational engagement ubiquitous in Calicut\nCalicut has vibrant social & educational activities\n\n\n\nCausation and endogeneity\n\nDid communal violence destroy civic networks?\n\nCity of Surat (in Gujarat) had a bad riot after destruction of Ayodhya mosque in 1992\n\nMajority of violence confined to slums\nIn old city, peace committees quickly formed\n\n\nA transformative ideological shift in national politics caused systematic organizational efforts\nIn short-to medium-run, organizational civic order became a constraint on behavior of politicians"

    "text": "Bailard, Catie Snow. 2012. “A Field Experiment on the Internet’s Effect in an African Election: Savvier Citizens, Disaffected Voters, or Both?” Journal of Communication 62(2): 330-344.\nI like this one a lot.\n\nResearch Question:\nDoes the internet influence evaluations of the government and motivate people to organize politically?\n\n\nContributions to Literature:\n\nThis paper tests the internet’s effect at a more antecedent and foundational stage of political behavior. Past literature looks at the internet’s influence after people have already moved to act and organize. \nThe second contribution is methodological. A field experiment can provide direct causal tests. This is a first for this body of research.\n\n\n\nTheory:\nWhy would the internet have an effect on political organization?\n“Mirror-Holding” - The internet enables more people to mirror hold. What does this mean? \n\nThe Internet holds up a mirror for users to better discern and reflect on how their government is actually performing. \nThe global nature of the Internet also opens more panoramic windows that better enable individuals to view how governments function in other countries, particularly the high-functioning democracies that tend to be most visible on the Internet. This provides users with a more realistic and globally consistent scale by which to make comparative evaluations about their own government’s performance. \n\nThe internet provides more information to citizens, from a broader range of perspectives, than would otherwise be the case-thus improving the capacity of citizens to make more informed evaluations of their governments. \n\nReminds me a bit of Kevin Munger supply and demand perspective of youtube. \n\nBy providing a venue to publicly document government’s failure or abuses, often coupled with pictures and videos, individuals more readily link their personal experiences to a much larger, pervasive, and entrenched national trend.\n\n\nHypothesis:\nThis the internet will provide a more robust and different set of information regarding the integrity of the Tanzania election compared to that provided by the traditional media.\n\n\nMethod:\nField Experiment:\n\nFocus: 2010 Tanzania elections \n\nWhy?: 2010 elections were not deemed fully free and fair? \n\nUchaguzi (an internet platform) allowed people to create a visual map of where election abuses were reported - allowing citizens to view and reflect on it. \n\nUnit of analysis: Tanzanian individuals \n\nSubjects were recruited in person at several congregation points in the community of Morogoro. Morgogoro is 120 miles away from the economic capital. 200k population. 200 names were collected. Using random assignment, 70 respondents were given the internet treatment and 70 respondents were given the no-internet control condition. \nSubjects were asked to meet at internet cafes. Pre Surveys were given. Individuals then had access to the internet at the cafe for 2 months. Control group was not given internet time but would gain it after the experiment was over. No restrictions were put on how respondents used the internet. After 2 months, respondents were contacted again for a post survey.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nTreatment group had less faith in a fair election and believed the recount was less fair. \nUsers with facebook accounts were more likely to think the election was unfair.\nTreatment was also more likely to trust the police force.\n***Internet users who became more aware of electoral abuses also may have become less likely to believe that their vote mattered as a consequence. While some protested, others simply stayed home. \n\nThe internet may be a double edged sword. \n\nThe internet can alter the cost-benefit calculus of political behavior by expanding the range of information individuals have regarding their government’s actual performance.\nMembers of the disaffected Internet group were less likely to vote. \n\nShowing internet is not the amazing positive force we thought it was \n\nThis is obvious now but in 2010 not so much! \n\n\n\n\n\nStone’s Thoughts:\nI love this article! The theory section regarding how the internet influences political behavior is really intuitive. I think I have a good understanding for how the internet influenced all of us and how it culminated into Trump and the polarization across the world. Let me (attempt) to explain my perspective. \n\nFor the masses: The internet increased communication and information (duh). As Bailard points out, this changes the cost-benefit analysis for individuals to FORM political opinions. In essence, it becomes easier to engage in politics because it reduces the cost to do so. Information can be obtained so readily and easy that people can engage and it seems Bailard shows this to be the case. As a result, the SUPPLY of voters/individuals interested in politics, increases. \nFor elites: The internet provides a new platform for people to engage in politics. Prior to the internet, the barrier to become an elite was much more difficult. The internet democratized who can be an elite. Youtube, facebook, etc. provided a space for anyone to become an elite. This increased the SUPPLY of elites (look at Kevin Munger’s work). The greater supply of elites introduced greater VARIATION in ideology of the elite class (this is how you get polarization to increase as more and more people are expressing different viewpoints). The increased variation of ideology in the elite class spills over into the information and cues they provide to the masses. Because it is easier to be an elite and share information, the masses now have greater access to the variation in perspectives. In short, there used to be a strong barrier towards becoming an elite, perhaps gated by education, money, network, etc; however, the internet basically allows anyone to become an elite and provide cues to people. \nThere is a greater SUPPLY of informed voters, SUPPLY of elites, SUPPLY of information and that is what might be driving our polarized epoch. \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk."

    "text": "Mishler, William, and Richard Rose. 2001. “What are the origins of Political Trust? Testing Institutional and Cultural Theories in Post-communist Societies.” Comparative Political Studies 34(1): 30-62.\n\nBumper Sticker:\n“Micro-level institutional arrangements are the source of political trust.”\n\n\nResearch Question:\nWhat is the source of political trust?\n\n\nPurpose:\nUnderstanding how trust begins is important for the consolidation of new democracies. There are competing explanations for the sources of political trust. Some hypotheses stress exogenous determinants  (these are considered cultural theories) while others stress endogenous determinants (these are considered institutional theories). Both can take micro- and macro-level forms. The authors set out to assess which determinants are stronger.\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\n\n(National Culture): Trust in political institutions varies between countries rather than among individuals according to historically rooted, national experiences embedded in interpersonal structure.\n(Individual socialization): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries according to individuals’ trust in others as shaped by their places in the social structure.\n(Government performance): Trust in institutions varies across rather than within countries in proportion to the success of government policies and the character of political institutions.\n(Individual evaluations): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries in accordance with both individuals attitudes and values and the social and economic positions individuals occupy.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nStrongly support the superiority of institutional explanations (endogenous) of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. \nThe effects of macro-political and economic performance on trust are indirect and mediated at the micro level by an individual’s value-laden perceptions\nContrary to cultural theories, interpersonal trust varies widely within societies and has little appreciable effect on institutional trust at either the aggregate or individual levels\nmicro-institutional hypothesis (Hypothesis 4) is confirmed, and the other hypotheses (Hypothesis 1 through Hypothesis 3) are rejected.\n\nBuilding trust: (p. 56) Trust can be nurtured by improving the conduct and performance of political institutions. Governments can generate public trust the old-fashioned way: They can earn it by responding promptly and effectively to public priorities, rooting out corrupt practices, and protecting new freedoms (Hetherington, 1998, reaches similar conclusions). Political institutions also can earn trust through economic policies that promise and ultimately provide a better material future for the country as a whole.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nData - data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. \n\nAggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with survey data on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. \n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey data (p. 40) analyzed here come from the fifth New Democracies Barometer (NDB V), organized by the Paul Lazarsfeld Society, Vienna, and the seventh New Russia Barometer (NRB VII), organized by the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde.\n\nNDB interviews were conducted between January 1998 and May 1998 in seven Central and East European countries—Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia—and in two successor states of the former Soviet Union, Belarus and Ukraine. \nProfessional survey firms conducted face-to-face interviews using national probability samples of approximately 1,000 in each country. \nIn addition, NRB interviews were conducted in Russia by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion in March 1998 and April 1998 using a multistage national probability sample that yielded 1,904 face-to-face interviews \n\nTo test the effects of both national context and individual differences\n\nPooled the survey data from the 10 countries in a single multinational file of 11,499 respondents.\nEach country was weighted equally as having 1,000 cases, and a variety of macro-contextual and aggregate performance variables were added to the merged data set so that respondents could be analyzed in terms of both their individual attributes and their national contexts.\n\nInstitutional trust was measured using the question “There are many different institutions in the country, for example, the government, courts, police, civil servants. Please show me on this 7-point scale, where 1 represents great distrust and 7 represents trust, how much is your personal trust in each of the following institutions?”\nThen were asked “how much do you trust most people you meet?”\n\n\n\nWhen testing micro theories\n\nFive proxies for political socialization are included in the model: age, education, gender, town size, and church attendance.\nFive political performance measures also are used, including the aggregate index of political corruption and micro-level perceptions of personal freedom, government fairness, political corruption, and government responsiveness to citizen influence.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nCultural Theories - view trust as exogenous to political institutions and are a basic character trait learned early in life.\n\nMicro-Theories - focus on differences in individual socialization experiences as sources of significant variation in political trust within as well as between societies.\nMacro-Theories - emphasize the homogenizing tendencies of national traditions and make little allowance for variation in trust among individuals within societies\n\nInstitutional Theories - view trust as endogenous and as a consequence of institutional performance.\n\nMicro-Theories - emphasize the aggregate performance of institutions in such matters as promoting growth, governing effectively, and avoiding corruption.\n\nThe outputs of institutional trust are assumed to determine individual responses.\n\nMacro-Theories - emphasize that individual evaluations of institutional performance are conditioned by individual tastes and experiences\n\nSuch as whether a person thinks that political integrity or economic growth is more important and whether that individual personally has experienced the effects of corruption or the benefits of economic growth. \n\n\nMacro-Theories - emphasize that trust is a collective or group property broadly shared by all members of a society\nMicro-Theories - hold that trust varies among individuals within a society based on differences in socialization and social background, political and economic experiences, or individual perceptions and evaluations.\nLifetime-Learning Model - A model that integrates early-life socialization and adult learning, thereby allowing direct empirical comparisons.\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nPopular trust in political institutions is vital to democracy, but in post-Communist countries, popular distrust for institutions is widespread, and prospects for generating increased political trust are uncertain given disagreements over its origins. Cultural theories emphasizing exogenous determinants of trust compete with institutional theories emphasizing endogenous influences, and both can be further differentiated into micro and macro variants. Competing hypotheses drawn from these theories are tested using data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Aggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with survey data on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. Results strongly support the superiority of institutional explanations of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. This encourages cautious optimism about the potential for nurturing popular trust in new democratic institutions."

Individuals are negatively impacted by uncivil exchanges on televised political discourse as evidenced by lower trust in government on surveys following exposure.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nMutz and Reeves write that “when political actors engage in TV interactions that violate the norms for everyday, face-to-face discourse, they reaffirm viewers’ sense that politicians cannot be counted on to obey the same norms for social behavior by which ordinary citizens abide” (2). Does this work in the opposite direction? If politicians began treating each other respectfully on televised debates, would we expect to see an increase in political trust and that would translate into greater political participation?\nRelated to the question above – if we assume that academic literature is the dominant civil medium for research-backed discourse, and that this discourse is important for policy change, institutional stability, and informed public participation in politics, how do we amplify its reach?\nIf this study were repeated today, would the results hold? Do we agree that people expect political actors to act civilly toward each other? And if not, is this partly due to the dwindling approval ratings overall of our politicians and our political institutions?\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nTelevision and political trust\n\nRobinson popularized term “videomalaise” in 1975 to refer to attitudes that resulted from watching television news\nEvidence supporting the causal claim that television is responsible for low levels of political trust has been limited\n\nClaims have broadened into general critique of political journalism\n\nMain emphasis of research has been on the extent to which televised politics heightens the importance of personality characteristics in general evaluations of candidates\n\nCandidates’ personal qualities more important to voters who obtained political news from TV (Keeter 1987)\nTV primes people to rely more on personality perceptions when evaluating candidates (Druckman 2003)\n\nSocial psychology theories of human-media interaction suggest that TV political disagreements would exacerbate the “intensification of feeling” Lippmann described in 1925\n\n“When political actors engage in TV interactions that violate the norms for everyday, face-to-face discourse, they reaffirm viewers’ sense that politicians cannot be counted on to obey the same norms for social behavior by which ordinary citizens abide” (2)\nFocus of this study is TV b/c it’s the dominant medium\n\n\nTheoretical basis for videomalaise\n\nTo trust = to assume that a person or institution will “observe the rules of the game” (Citrin and Muste 1999)\n\nPeople expect political actors who appear on television to abide by the same social norms acknowledged by ordinary Americans\nPeople react negatively to incivility (even if it’s on TV)\n\nExperience of political conflict on TV substantially different from real life\n\nNeed for politeness is particularly great when expressing controversial views (Kingwell 1995)\nPoliteness and respect toward individuals involved in a legal conflict enhances their perceptions of fair treatment (Tyler 1990)\n\nTelevision world provides uniquely intimate perspective on conflicts\n\nWhen social norms for civility are violated on TV, viewers’ intimate perspective intensifies an already negative reaction to incivility\nReeves & Nass (1996) show that when motion appears on TV, physiological responses are the same as when motion occurs in the immediate environment – the human brain hasn’t evolved quickly enough to respond in rational ways to technologies such as TV\n\nWhen encountering differences of opinion in person, people tend to downplay differences and maintain a polite, cordial atmosphere\n\nIn contrast, TV emphasizes conflict and strong differences of opinion to enhance dramatic value and attract viewers\nTV is also a highly intimate medium\n\nCentral hypothesis: This violation of social norms should cause negative reactions toward politicians and government\n\nPeople expect others to obey social norms and evaluate them less favorably when they don’t\nGiven that the normative expectation is one of civility, this influence should be primarily a function of negative reactions to incivility rather than positive reaction s to civility\nFurther hypothesize that TV viewers will respond negatively to incivility on TV due to largely gut-level, emotional reactions to violations of social norms rather than a cognitive awareness of excessive conflict\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\n\nProblems with validity and reliability of self-reported media exposure (Price & Zaller 1993), so experimental design used\nCentral manipulation: the extent to which politicians exchanged political viewpoints in a manner that violates the typical norms governing face-to-face political conflict\n\nUsed adults and undergraduates\nExposed viewers to systematically different versions of 4 different political disagreements drawn from a larger pool\n\nManipulated extent of civility and politeness w/o altering political content\nExpectation that when dissonant views were presented in an uncivil fashion, they would encourage more negative, distrustful attitudes toward politics and politicians\n\nProfessional actors hired to play roles of 2 congressional candidates with TV studio/political talk show mock program\nTeleprompters used to hep actors adhere closely to a script\nCandidates assigned opposing views on each issue and interaction was to be civl or uncivil\n\nExperiment 1: free trade, mental health insurance, Internet privacy regulation, and NASA funding\nExperiment 2: tobacco regulation, taxation of retail sales on the Internet, public service experience, and free trade\nExperiment 3: tobacco regulation, Internet taxes, repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, and public service experience\n\nEach edited to 5 min in length\n\n\n2 versions of each exchange taped\n\nCandidates expressed exactly same position in same words in both versions, offered same arguments, but civil exchanges were VERY civil and uncivil exchanges took personal jabs, raised voices, and never apologized (as well as rude nonverbal reactions)\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows results: candidates in uncivil versions of issue exchanges consistently perceived as less polite, more quarrelsome, more emotional, agitated, and hostile\n\n2 null findings: no perceived ideological differences in a candidate’s stand in civil vs. uncivil condition\n\n\n\nProcedures\n\nParticipants sat alone in a room w/a comfy couch and overstuffed chair, coffee table, and 32-inch TV\n\nAfter consent, they filled out a pretest questionnaire\nThen viewed 20 min of TV program featuring same scripted disagreements on 4 different issues\nThen filled out posttest questionnaire\n\nSubjects in experiment #2 not told hypothesis in order to facilitate follow-up interviews by phone\n\n\nExperiment 1 subjects randomly assigned to civil or uncivil conditions (n = 67)\nExperiment 2 included a 3rd control condition where subjects didn’t watch any political TV (n = 155)\n\nControl group included to determine whether differences between civil and uncivil condition swerve due to an elevation of political trust in the civil condition, a decrease in trust in the uncivil condition, or some combo\nThis control group filled out same pre- and posttest questionnaires but watched a non-political program\n\nExperiment 3 used within-subjects design where all were assigned to both civil and uncivil conditions in random order to understand process of influence\nPolitical trust measured from National Election Studies under rubric of support for the political system\n\nResults\n\nData analyzed by testing difference of mean levels of trust in 2 conditions in experiment 1; all 3 trust measures significantly influenced negatively by uncivil exchange (see Figure 2)\n\nPeople differentiated between the importance of public conflict and the civility of that conflict\nUncivil versions perceived to be more entertaining than civil versions"

In addition, conservative and right-wing people have also been associated with a more intuitive cognitive style in the way they process information (Deppe et al. 2015).

What if our dismal assessments of the individual capabilities of citizens were based on measures driven, in part, by the reasonable decisions of those very same citizens, rather than on innate capabilities alone?\n\n\nHypothesis:\nCitizen capability and choice are funneled through contextual and structural elements in a society to produce political sophistication.\n\n\nData:\n\n1989 Cross-national Euro-Barometer survey data from 12 pre-1995 EU nations\n\n\n\nMethods:\nOrdinary Least Squares regression model\n\n\nFindings:\n\nConsiderable and significant differences in citizen political sophistication across nations due to contextual factors shaping availability, usefulness, and cost political info.\n\nCitizen performance varies from country to country\nPartisan and electoral systems that increase uncertainty of how election outcomes will be reflected in representative institutions or muddy the party-policy linkages in the minds of the voters act as strong disincentives for active accumulation and usage of accurate political info\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nLiterature on political sophistication offers 2 competing visions of the electorate:\n\nMass public is not well versed in matters of politics\nConclusions about voters not valid\n\nMeasurement strategies/instruments not good\nConclusions of first view overlook useful info voters do have and use\n\n\nAuthors agree with 2nd view and seek to operationalize definition of sophistication\n\nIndividual levels of sophistication are the product of choices driven by a contextual incentive structure\n\nClassic view: Converse (1964) – voter opinions not ideologically constrained across time or issues; this is basically stating that voters don’t understand politics\n\nCitizens can’t hold reps accountable if they don’t understand the system\n\nMore generous view rejects this\n\nMeasures used to estimate level of info and integration crude and unreliable (Achen 1975; Erikson 1979; Luskin 1987)\nMeasures systematically underestimate levels of info and cognitive capacity among citizens (Nie & Andersen 1974)\nIndividuals may not be politically sophisticated but democracy is safe b/c sophistication is a “collective phenomenon” (Feld & Grofman 1988)\nCollective public opinion measures stable and consistent (Page & Shapiro 1992; Stimson 1991)\nEven in absence of high levels of info, voters may successfully use scant amounts of info to develop specific issue positions; they can take cues from\n\naffective orientation toward relevant actors (Brady & Sniderman 1985)\nPolitical environment (Zaller 1992)\nGeneral orientations toward politics or specific issue areas (Feldman 1988 & 1989; Peffley & Hurwitz 1993)\n\nIndividuals understand issues that are personally salient (Neuman 1986)\nRecognized difference in stability and consistency between opinion on ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ issues (Carmines & Stimson 1989)\n\n“While many citizens lack extensive political information, ‘assessing voters by civics exams misses the many things that voters do know, and the many ways they can do without the facts that the civics tradition assumes they should know’ (Popkin 1991, 20; emphasis in the original)” (128).\n\n\nPublic’s performance on measures of sophistication not sufficient to illustrate political capabilities\n\nShortcomings may be the product of systems – and individual choices structured by those systems\nCurrent 3 components to measure sophistication:\n\n\n\nMeans (cognitive capacity)\nMotive (incentives toward collecting and using accurate political info)\nOpportunity (availability of aforementioned info)\n\n\nHow do we measure this accurately then?\n\nCapabilities\n\nSmart people can and do have more info and more accurate info\nIndividual-level characteristics have an effect on sophistication\n\nEducation\nIncome\nOccupational status\nMedia usage\n\nThese variables may be the best proxies to control for different dimensions of individual capabilities\nThe more highly educated may have been indoctrinated into the standard belief system/dominant social ideology\nBeing at a higher ed or socioeconomic status may reduce costs of collecting political info\n\n\nChoices\n\nAs opportunities to get info become more scarce, motivation to get it must increase; thus, several factors will structure these choices:\n\nParty system\n\nIndividuals in multiparty system would be more motivated to collect info b/c opportunity to do so is greater\nDowns’ (1957) median voter theorem tells us parties will try to differentiate themselves from each other to mobilize support – increasing available info\nThis effect declines as number of parties get significantly higher\n\nElectoral system\n\nNationally competitive elections will increase political sophistication by increasing motivation\nParliamentary societies lower cost of political info b/c parties’ positions are stable\nCompulsory voting increases turnout and may increase sophistication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData and Analysis\n\nSophistication: using 1989 Euro-Barometer postelection survey in 12 nations of pre-1995 EU by calculating absolute distances between respondent’s placement of each of his or her society’s political parties on a 10-point ideological scale and the mean placement of those parties by the remaining respondents from that society\n\nCompute a mean across these distances that equals the inaccuracy of the respondent’s info using the society mean as the baseline\nLow scores = high sophistication so they invert this measure\nDV sophistication 0-9 w/9 representing extremely high level of sophistication"

If so, how?\n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\n\nDevelops  a theory that accounts for the variety of ways in which pro- and anti- gay-rights actors engage with the media, which generates clear expectations about how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs.\nThe author argues that increased overall media consumption enhances support for LGBTQs, but that this effect is driven by consumption of newspaper, internet and social media. This is because government censorship of queer content is often directed at television programs that contain positive representations of LGBTQs.\nThe media impacts public opinion of the LGBTQ+ community through (1) exposing individuals to positive representation and (2) exposing individuals to new information in general\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nDifferent types of media produce distinct effects on public opinions of LGBTQ+ people\n\nRadio and television have no significant effect on pro-gay attitudes\nNewspapers, internet, or social media have a positive effect on support\n\nThese effects are conditional on censorship of queer representation from certain mediums \nShow that governments proudly publicize their crackdowns on queer content in TV \n78 %  of respondents report negative attitudes towards homosexuality.\n\nHowever, individuals who consume more media overall are 4–8 %t more likely to express pro-gay beliefs.\n\nThrough content analysis of radio, newspaper and the internet, provide preliminary evidence that the mechanisms driving these effects is increased access and exposure to positive LGBTQ representation.\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nLooks at media consumption across thirty-three African countries. \nmulti-methods approach, which combines cross-sectional survey data with content analysis and descriptive data from across Africa\n\nCross-national survey data from Afrobarometer Round 6 conducted in 2014 and 2015.\n\nEstimates 6 binomial logits \nCountry fixed effects and district-clustered standard errors help to account for country and sub-national differences \n\nOne to look at the impact of an individuals aggregate score across, and then one for each of the 5 mediums \n\nResults hold when replicated using OLS and ordered-probit models \n\n\n\nIV:\n\nquestions in the survey that ask how often the respondent gets their news from five different sources: radio, television, newspaper, internet and social media.\n\n\n\nDV:\n\nprimary dependent variable is a question in the survey that asks how the respondent would feel about having a ‘homosexual’ as a neighbor\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nPolitical leaders across Africa frequently accuse the media of promoting homosexuality, while activists often use the media to promote pro-LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) narratives. Despite extensive research on how the media affects public opinion, including studies that show how exposure to certain information can increase support of LGBTQs, there is virtually no research on how the media influences attitudes towards LGBTQs across Africa. This study develops a theory that accounts for actors’ mixed approach to the media and shows how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs. Specifically, the study finds that radio and television have no, or a negative, significant effect on pro-gay attitudes, whereas individuals who consume more newspapers, internet or social media are significantly more likely to support LGBTQs (by approximately 2 to 4 per cent). The author argues that these differential effects are conditional on censorship of queer representation from certain mediums. The analysis confirms that the results are not driven by selection effects, and that the relationship is unique to LGBTQ support but not other social attitudes. The results have important implications, especially given the growing politicization of same-sex relations and changing media consumption habits across Africa."

    "text": "Aldrich, John H. 1993. “Rational Choice and Turnout.” American Journal of Political Science 37(1): 246-278.\n\nContext:\nRational choice is very popular within the voter turnout field. At the time, people were moving away from RCT, Aldrich argues that it is still useful and can’t help us get closer to explaining why some people vote and others do not. \n\n\nGoal:\nUse rational choice to help us understand why some people vote and others do not. \n\nWe can find variables that increase or decrease the likelihood of turning out. But they never in an absolute sense tell us above. \n\n\n\nThe Basic Model:\n\nPreferences determine behavior \n\nRat choice is about HOW those preferences determine behavior\n\nA citizen’s preferences are realized in the outcome. We infer a voters preference through the action of who they vote for. \n\nCitizens’ preferences are transformed into utilities for outcomes when it matters how much the citizen prefers one outcome over another. \n\nConclusions of basic model: \n\nNever vote for the less preferred candidate\nIf costs of voting are high, always abstain\nIf costs of voting are zero, then vote for A because voting for A dominates abstaining \nIf cost is between 0 and 5, the basic model is silent. Rational choice models of turnout differ over ways to handle these cases. See figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nRat Choice:\nRational choice theories are theories about the (expected) utility associated with outcomes generates or induces preferences for the particular actions at hand. \n\nFundamental is that rat choice argues that whichever outcome has a higher utility (1,0), the individual will choose actions to receive the higher utility outcome. \nActions are instruments to achieve outcomes\nThe action of voting is an instrument to achieve the desired outcome. \n\n\n\nCost of Voting:\n\nVoting is not a costless action. \n\nYou have to obtain information, process it, decide what to do. \nYou have to go to the polls. \n\nSome people say that not voting is costless\n\nAldrich disagrees, rational abstainers must pay cost of deciding to vote or not. \n\nCost of voting is represented as, C\nC &gt; 0 \nWhen costs are high -&gt; voter turnout decreases\n\n“When registration laws were passed, poll taxes were raised, or residency requirements were enacted, turnout fell.\n\n\nVoters must still give some thought to what others might do. That factors into the voters choice to act. \n\nIf the voter thinks that their candidate will lose considerably, they probably will be less likely to vote. \n\nTHE PROBLEM: voters do not know the situation they face.\n\n\n\n\nThe Calculus of Voting Model:\n\nInitially developed by Downs and extended by Riker. \n\nControversial addition to the model. The term D\nD represents the value of seeing democracy continue. If noe voted, Downs argued the political system would fail and thus some vote to ensure the continued vitality of democracy.\n\nRiker continues this - change it to “citizens duty” \n\n\nAdding a D term is the same as subtracting a C term. \n\nMore of a sense of citizen duty can counter the cost of voting. \nD does not change anything unless D &gt; C. \n\nCRITICAL INNOVATION TO CALCULUS OF VOTING MODEL: \n\nEach person assigns a probability of the state of the world being true. \n\nThe probability that one vote will make a difference.\n\n\nCan be summed up through the equation: \n\nR = PB + D - C\n\nIf R is positive, vote for candidate A (voters preferred candidate) if not, abstain.\nR = Rewards \nP = Probability of one vote breaking a tie \nB = difference in utility for candidate A instead of B winning (diff in benefits) \nD = citizen duty\nC = cost of voting \n\nHigher P = higher voter turnout \nC, D, and B are strong predictors of turnout.\n\nProblems with the Calculus of Voting model\n\nD term is hotly debated \n\nIf you vote because “you wanted to” then voting is not instrumental towards an outcome.\n\nRat choices are models of how one acts, given tastes. They are not models of where “taste” comes from. \n\n\nThe P term is not realistic. It is not reasonable to assume your vote will break a tie. \n\n\n\n\nThe Minimax Regret Model\n\nDeveloped by Ferejohn and Fiorina \nReject completing the basic model. \n\nThey argue people’s ability to form probability assessments of the state of the world is basically too difficult and near impossible. \n\nIf these probability assessments cannot be formed, they argue that the calculus of the voting model can not be used. \n\n\nInstead of expected utility maximization, they propose a decision rule called minimax regret\n\nSuppose a voter decided to abstain. Their preferred candidate loses by one vote. That voter would be regretful of their decision. \n\nThus they measure the level of regret \n\n\nMinimax regret refers to taking the action that yields the minimum of these maximum regrets. \n\nThis model differs in what to do on the middle columns as seen in figure 1. \n\nThey argue their model is better than the calculus model and better predicts turnout more often.\nProblems with the Minimax Regret Model: \n\nP term is still an issue \n\nP at least exist but is small \n\nHonestly this was a bit over my head. See page 259 - was confused. \n\n\nSecond issue is the wasted voting undermines the plausibility of minimax regret \n\n\n\n\nA Third Approach - Game Theoretic Accounts:\n\nAldrich the other models have problems \nTho other models are based on decision theory\n\nNo one decision is assumed to affect the decisions of others. \n\nThe decisions of others are highly aggregated \n\n\nGame theory models do not make this mistake and assume that decisions are based on taking others’ decisions into explicit account. \n\nWait but aldrich says that problems in the calculus model are still at least somewhat present in game theory models \n\n????????????????????\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rationality of Turnout:\n\nTurnout is cheap \nInformation gain is asymmetric \nElections differ in salience and impact.\nTurnout is still a collective action problem BUT not a good example. Collective action problems typically assume importance because they are high-cost, high benefit decisions, where small P terms mean that the high B terms are substantially discounted. Turnout is a low cost, low benefit decision and she’s little light on most important collective action problems. \n\n\n\nStrategic Politicians and Rational Choice Turnout:\n\n\nA strategic politician explains why turnout is higher in close elections. \n\nMore investment into close contests and this will be reflected in increasing levels of turnout. \n\n\n\nStrategic politicians inform voters of the wasted-vote argument and convince at least some voters that it is sensible to act ast strategic voters \n\nI forget the name but there is a new book out that discusses how and where candidates go to campaign (physically). He basically finds that campaign events don’t really do anything other than increase turnout."

It moves from research at the aggregate level, including why there is country level variation in voter turnout and finishes on individual level research review and why people vote.\n\n\nIV:\nsocio-econ environment, party system, level of development, electoral rules such as compulsory, institutional structure, importance of election/ Resource model, psychological model, mobilization model, rational choice theory/Generational replacement and lowering of age, fractionalization of party system, declining group mobilization \n\n\nDV:\nWhat accounts for voter turnout variation in the aggregate/individually/why is there a decline starting in the 1990s \n\n\nOutcome:\n\nPatterns and Trends: A total of 533 elections and 106 countries are included. All democratic legislative elections (1972-2004), mean turnout 75% and stable with variation in the 3 points range. Variation in country is around 5 points. No central tendency. Turnout decline over time of 8 to 9 points. Higher in established democracies (29 countries) and slightly higher in presidential elections. \nExplaining Turnout Variations across Countries: Three sets of factors have been identified: the socioeconomic environment, the institutional set-up, and the party system (Powell 1982; Blais and Dobrzynska 1998). Difference between poor and other countries (undistinguishable amongst the wealthy). Compulsory system affect turnout with a 10-15 points higher turnout (not sure if it is about the sanctions). PR and high magnitude, higher turnout /= in Latin America. Important elections and relative power of the seat at stake=higher turnout/ with a caveat (Blais 2000). Higher leverage of lower house predicts best higher turnout. Facility of voting does not produce measurable findings. Turnout appears to be higher when there are less parties in contention. “Closeness” of the results might have an effect. No real consensus on this.\nExplaining the Recent Turnout Decline: three reasons for the 9 points decline since 1990 1) Generational replacement, Degree of competition of the election (Franklin). + voting age lowering is not a culprit , 2) Fractionalization in party system, 3)declining group mobilization (especially where union density has subsided). Not completely set\nThe Decision to Vote or not to Vote: age and education are the two most significant factors, followed by religiosity, income, and marital status (Blais 2000)."

The purpose of this article is to more appropriately assess the relationship between collective nostalgia and populism by situating collective nostalgia as a psychological factor that contributes to populism. \n\n\nSummary/Theory/Argument:\nFollowing the ideational approach, this study claims that populists aim to facilitate the moralistic separation between the pure people (us) and the corrupt elite (them). While constituting the boundaries of us vs. them, populists create an in-group vs. out-group identity. To this end, one of the primary tools that populists utilize is collective nostalgia. Populists offer their constituencies a golden age – a heartland where corruption, disruptions and enemies do not exist. \nElçi situates populism and collective nostalgia in the context of Turkey, where contemporary secularist and Islamic cleavages exist as a product of structures established under the Ottoman Empire. The cleavage exemplifies the ruling center (secularist elites) and the ruled periphery (the Islamic people).  The ruling center adopted Kemalist beliefs - pushing the country to modernize, become secular, and overall promote nationalism. This push was the result of the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990’s, leaving a power vacuum in the region that was filled by the Kurds . In response to this, political Islam is aggrandizing the Ottoman past as a tool for the reconstruction of “the Great Turkey” today. In this way, they are experiencing Ottoman nostalgia - a desire to return to “the golden days” and become a leader of the Islamic world.  Ottoman nostalgia is much older than Kemalist nostalgia - which began to emerge in the 1990’s following increased pressure by the EU to privatize, as well as increased exposure to the IMF and World bank, which challenged the existing values of the Kemalists. This nostalgia is characterized by ‘the memory of a strong, independent, self-sufficient state and its secularist modernization politics which dominated the public sphere through the past century’.\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe more nostalgic respondents are, the more populist attitudes they will express, because nostalgia creates a ‘pure people vs. corrupt elites’ duality.\nRespondents in the nostalgia treatment groups should be more populist than those in the control group in the experimental setting.\nThe effect of the Ottoman nostalgia treatment on populist attitudes should be greater than the Kemalist nostalgia stimulus in the experimental setting.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nCollective nostalgia has a significantly positive relationship with populist attitudes even after control for various independent variables - such as religiosity, partisanship, satisfaction with life and Euroscepticism\nOttoman nostalgia increases populist attitudes\nKemalist nostalgia has a weak direct effect on attitude that disappears when party preference is controlled for\n\n\n\nMethod:\nUses a representative survey (n=1,954) and experimental datasets\n\nthe  survey tests the link between individuals’ predisposition to nostalgia and populist attitudes (H1)\nDV:Populist beliefs\n\n constructed from four survey items from previous research that Elçi aggregated into an index ranging from 0 (least agreement) to 100 (most agreement)\n\nIV: Nostalgia\n\nConstructed from four different survey items that seek to measure the importance of past values, past experiences, old tastes, and the country’s glorious past\n\nControls: \n\nThree sets of IVs to control for the relationship between populism and nostalgia\n\nsupport for EU membership, satisfaction with democracy, economic conditions, and life, and interpersonal trust questions\nAlevi, Kurdish and religiosity, where the cross-cutting cleavages in Turkish society occur.\nPartisanship, sex, age, education, income, urban residency. \n\n\nCreated 10 different models to control for the effect of nostalgia with party preference and satisfaction with life, democracy, and economic conditions.\n\nAlso performed an experimental analysis\n\ncreated a between-group experimental design in which two groups received different types of nostalgic messages\n\nThese were Ottoman and Kemalist\nAlso used a control group that DID NOT receive any stimulus\n\nData was collected using convenience sampling - respondents were recruited through Facebook and Instagram ads using Qualtrics survey tool\nN = 911 \n\nWere asked a series of warmup questions - such as satisfaction with democracy, lives, and economic conditions \nRandomly assigned them to groups\nIntroduced experimental vignettes \n\nOttoman and Kemalist groups were presented with a message priming them to respond to texts about history of Turkey\nControl group did not receive any message\n\n\ntested the effect of nostalgia treatments on populist attitudes by building a populism index with five items taken from Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove (2014).\nsummed all items and built a scale between 0 and 100, where 100 indicates higher populist attitudes\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nPopulism\n\n(Mudde, 2007) a thin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into to homogenous and antagonistic groups:\n\nthe pure people versus the corrupt elite\n\n\nCollective Nostalgia\n\n(Wildschut et al. 2014) the nostalgic reverie that is contingent upon thinking of oneself in terms of a particular social identity or as a member of a particular group and concerns events or objects related to it\n\nCleavages \n\n(Somer & McCoy, 2019) formative rifts that ’either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nTurkey’s populist Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) exploits nostalgic rhetoric to dominate the country’s politics.\n\nemphasize the glorious days of the Ottoman and Seljukian empires\n\nPopulists frequently emphasize that the elites hijacked the people’s will long ago, and they promise to return power to the people. \n\nAccording to this logic, back in the good old days corrupt elites were not powerful enough to abuse the authentic people.\n\nAccording to populists, the people’s will is the cornerstone of politics \nMany scholars agree that populism appears as a backlash to a sense of severe crisis (Rooduijn 2014; Taggart 2004) or discontent (Spruyt, Keppens and Van Droogenbroeck 2016). \n\nThis sense of extreme crisis paves the way for raising concerns about the present conditions, which is a breeding ground for populism (Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove 2014). \nPopulists blame the establishment for the decline in the people’s economic, political and living standards (Rooduijn, van der Brug and de Lange 2017).\n\nPopulism can also be generated by unsolved, long-lasting and cross-cutting political cleavages within a society. Somer and McCoy (2019, 8) define these cleavages as formative rifts that ’either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime\nNostalgia is a yearning for the past \n\nAccording to Strauth and Turner (1988) it has four component parts\n\nFirst, ‘there is the view of history as decline and loss, being a departure from some golden age of “homefulness”’. \nSecond,  is the problem that there exists ‘a sense of the loss of wholeness and moral certainty’. \n\nAt this point, ‘history is seen to be a collapse of values which had once provided the unity of social relations and personal experience’. \n\nThe third is related to ‘the loss of individual autonomy and the collapse of genuine social relationships’. \nLast but not least, nostalgia is ‘the sense of a loss of simplicity, spontaneity, and authenticity’\n\nNostalgia, or the way we remember our past, exacerbates in-group vs. out-group distinctions (Martinovic et al. 2018). \nNostalgia also strengthens shared social identity and distinguishes the in-group from other groups (Brown and Humphreys 2002; Wildschut et al. 2014).\n\nThe rise of populism is closely related to ‘acute despair at the present moment and a memory of a previous golden age’.\nThe golden age corresponds to the heartland in populist literature. \n\nCoined by Taggart (2004, 278), ‘the heartland is a construction of the good life derived retrospectively from a romanticized conception of life as it has been lived’. \nIt involves returning to the pre-lapsarian world, a Golden age before a catastrophic lapse or fall: in the post-lapsarian era, individuals feel lacking, deficient or oppressed (Tannock 1995).\n\nIn Turkey, secularists and Islamist cleavages exist\n\nThe secularists can be thought of as the elites and appear to be supported by the left\n\nthey have dominated Turkish politics and society as guardians of the Kemalist values\n\n The Islamist’s are the people, representing the ruled and appear to be supported by the right (Çarkoğlu 2012; Çarkoğlu and Hinich 2006).\n\nExpectations that impacted Control variable selection: \n\nThe author expects that the more dissatisfied respondents are with their lives in general, subjective economic conditions and democracy, the more populist attitudes they will have.\nReligiosity plays a pivotal role in explaining the party preferences of the Turkish constituency and is a key independent variable for explaining the center–periphery cleavage.\n\nTherefore expects more religious respondents to display more populist attitudes.\n\nExpect Alevi respondents to have less populist attitudes because they are more supportive of secularism.\nExpects that Kurdish respondents will have more populist attitudes because they are more critical of the Kemalist establishment.\nThe Peoples’ Democratic Party (Halkların Demokratik Partisi, HDP), as a radical democratic pro-Kurdish party, should also display more populist attitudes\nexpect CHP and Nationalist Action Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, MHP) voters to have less populist attitudes since they represent the status quo."

    "text": "Fitzgerald, Jennifer. 2018. Close to Home: Local Ties and Voting Radical Right in Europe. Cambridge University Press. Chapters TBD.\nChapter 1:\n\nResearch Question:\nWhy do people vote for radical right parties? Why do certain people at certain times in certain places decide that a radical right party or candidate merits their electoral support? \n\n\nFocus:\nEurope, North American, Oceania \n\nMainly Switzerland and France\n\n\n\nLiterature insights: \n\nOriginally, social group based voting was powerful and pervasive. The left had unions and the right had churches; these were stabilizing forces. \n\nHowever, as membership in unions and churches and their attendant social groups wanes, support for mainstream left and right parties becomes less socially rooted in a traditional sense and less habitual. \n\nInstead of approaching elections from particular social positions, people now make choices at the polls that are motivated by attitudes on specific policy issues and attraction to particular political leaders. \n\n\n\nLocalist Theory of Radical Right Voting: an account of unconventional electoral behavior that is motivated by people’s feelings of attachment to their local communities \n\n\nMain Argument:\n“I argue that those individuals with the strongest sense of belonging to their localities find the programs of radical right parties particularly appealing.” \n\nAll politics is local - Tip O’Neill\nLocal attachments underpin and motivate radical right support\n\n\n\nLocalism: \n\nSmall scale communities can offer a sense of belonging and a sense of place; research in psychology bears this out. \nGlobalization has changed things. \n\nAs globalism has increased, the importance of the local has grown in response. \n“Modern life has not erased the importance of place…It may have, instead, increased the need for people to draw boundaries, to more crisply define their geographic community…and to behave in ways that signal their place-related identities…People are often proud of where they are from, and they continue to want you to know it. (Cramer 2016: 240, fn. 12) \nGlobalization pushes people to invest reflexively in their local areas, it also threatens to undermine what makes each locality special. Pg 6 \n\nEric Hobsbawm: The impersonalizing forces of globalization push people to invent mental connections to social groups, thereby reinforcing the rise of identity politics. \n\n\n\nWhat is the typical right winger?\n\nMAN \nLow socio-economic status \nTypically holds negative view of modern developments \n\nImmigration, outsiders ruining “the way it was” \n\nTrad dudes. \n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting insights: \n\nHigh Social Capital negates the typical right winger. \n“Straddling the individual-aggregate divide are accounts informed by theorist of social capital; the argument is that individuals who invest in social capital (through the participation in civil society) and those communities rich in social capital will not find the radical right particularly appealing” (Coffe et al. 2007) \n\n\n\n***Social Capital v. Localism***\n\nSo like if you have good thoughts about your communities you will vote far right but if you’re very involved with community you won’t\nHaving very positive sentiment toward the locality and the people in it can make the radical right appealing. \nIn contrast, route engagement in community life wards off the appeals of these parties; when people invest their time and energy into participating in civil society and neighborhood life, the radical right is not so enticing an option. \n\nMoreover it is feelings of attachment not the actual routine social interaction that benefits radical right parties. \n\nWhen people avoid routine social and organizational activity, but still feel very positively tied to their local communities, they are powerfully primed to consider radical right programs alluring. \n\n\n\nFindings: \n\nI find that today’s passion for all things local and localities’ enhanced political salience have contributed to the growth of radical right parties. \nRadical right does best when locality is politically salient. \nLocal tues are most politically relevant when and where the locality has significant authority and autonomy, when and where the locality has recently lost substantial power, and when and where local elections are temporally proximal to national elections."

    "text": "Fowler, Anthony, et al. 2023. “Moderates,” American Political Science Review.\n\nAbstract:\nModerates are often overlooked in contemporary research on American voters. Many scholars who have examined moderates argue that these individuals are only classified as such due to a lack of political sophistication or conflicted views across issues. We develop a method to distinguish three ways an individual might be classified as moderate: having genuinely moderate views across issues, being inattentive to politics or political surveys, or holding views poorly summarized by a single liberal–conservative dimension. We find that a single ideological dimension accurately describes most, but not all, Americans’ policy views. Using the classifications from our model, we demonstrate that moderates and those whose views are not well explained by a single dimension are especially consequential for electoral selection and accountability. These results suggest a need for renewed attention to the middle of the American political spectrum.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nModerates need to be classified better and deserve more focus\n\n\nResearch Question:\nHow can we better identify moderates?\nWhy (from a survey perspective) are people moderate?\n\n\nBackground:\n\nWe typically think of moderates in the following:\n\npolitically unsophisticated\nuninformed\npolitically incoherent\nsecretly partisan\nideologically cross pressured\nextreme, with patterns of attitudes poorly by a single ideological dimension\n\nThere are obvious survey issues in trying to figure out if someone is a moderate.\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\nSort classically identified moderates into three subgroups of moderate type:\n\nthose who have genuinely centrist views that are well summarized by a single underlying ideological dimension (spatial)\n\nDownsian voters\n\nthose who are inattentive to politics or the survey (unsophisticated)\n\nrandom/incoherent views. The way in which they select answers has no coherence and basically makes no sense.\n\nspecial stats here but basically if they are showing to have a .5 probability for selecting either survey response question - that is essentially random and they are probably an inattentive voter.\n\n\nthose who hold genuine views that are not well summarized by a single ideological dimension (someone whose preferences are neither unsophisticated nor well summarized by the spatial model and, second, an ideology score on the liberal–conservative dimension were the respondent to be a spatial type (#1 above).)\n\nconversian respondents (named after Philip Converse)\n\ngenuine position holders but not well described in a left-right orientation.\nvoters that care about specific stuff -&gt; which might translate into a lack of a wide-ranging belief system.\nThey discriminate between thus if \\(\\neq\\) .5 relative likelihood then they are probably a conversian moderate.\n\n\n\nAssumes responses are perfect representations of preferences\n\nThe issues have been ordered such that if a Downsian gives a conservative answer on issue one, he or she will necessarily give a conservative answer on issues two and three, and so on such that the three questions divide Downsians at three points along the ideological spectrum.\nQuestions are also ordered by popularity.\n\nthis ordering and assumptions allows them to figure out who is a “downsian” voter\n\nif they conflict with the guttman scale - that is probably not a downsian voter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nCooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)\n\nAll CCES survey data from 2012 - 2018\n280k respondents\n\nAlso use another CCES Model\n\n2010\nasked 133 policy questions to 1,300 people.\n\nif the question was ordered they turned it into a binary scale.\n\nthey wanted all questions to be binary.\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nModerates are more attentive to elections (than liberals and conservatives)\n\nmore responsive to incumbency\nmore responsive to candidate experience\nmore responsive to ideologies\n\nMost moderates appear to be downsian\nresults suggest centrist voters drive the relative success of incumbents, centrists, and experienced candidates.\nFind 6.5% of CCES respondents are inattentive\n\nThis is a bit weird to me… Not sure how to say it. THIS IS SURVEY RESPONDENTS!\n\nthis seems to conflict with the general idea in the american voter that most voters are inattentive.\nSomeone that chooses to fill out a survey is probably less likely to be an inattentive voter."

    "text": "Mehlhaff, Isaac, et al. 2024. “Where Motivated Reasoning Withers and Looms Large: Fear and Partisan Reactions to the COVID-19 Pandemic,” American Journal of Political Science.\n\nAbstract:\nContemporary American politics has been largely characterized by hyperpartisanship and polarization, withpartisan-motivated reasoning a thematic concern. Theories of emotions in politics suggest that anxiety might interruptpartisan heuristics and encourage citizens to reason more evenhandedly—but in what domains and to what extent? We useoriginal panel data to assess how anxiety about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 interacted with partisan attachmentsto shape political judgment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The structure of our data allows us to assess large-scaleimplications of politically relevant emotions in ways that so far have not been possible. We find large effects on policyattitudes: Republicans who were afraid of getting sick rejected signals from copartisan leaders by supporting mask mandatesand the like. Effects on vote choice for Republicans were muted in comparison, but fear’s large effect on independents mayhave been pivotal.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nFear and anxiety can influence partisanship (a little)\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nWhy, then, did so many Republicans prefer policies starkly different from those suggested by their leaders but so few vote against those leaders?\nHow did the anxiety of COVID-19 influence partisan politics?\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nPartisanship influences how people see, act, and listen.\nAnxiety can influence both information gathering and information processing.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented opportunity to test the posited link between anxiety and interruption of partisan habits.\nPartisans typically listen to party elites.\n\nbut for many republicans during covid-19, they disagreed with the party elites.\n\nAccuracy Driven Reasoning: a processing style in which people exert more effort to reach correct conclusions. They “attend to relevant information more carefully,” “process it more deeply,” and “[consider] more alternatives”\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nFearful individuals will be more supportive of pandemic mitigation policies such as mask mandates.\nFearful individuals’ accuracy motivations to be visible in the information they consult\n\nthey should seek more information, including from sources they do not habitually use.\n\nFear to be associated with a greater likelihood of voting for Joe Biden\n\nwhy Biden? - because covid-19 mitigation information was more often endorsed by Biden.\n\nFearful Republicans should move further toward support for mitigation policies simply because their attitudes have more room to change in that direction.\n\n\n\nData:\n\nQualtrics survey in April 2020\n\nw/ follow up interviews in June, September, and October.\n\nExamine support for five pandemic related policies:\n\nmask mandates\nstay at home orders\nbusiness lockdowns\nmonitor of public spaces by police\nmandatory covid-19 testing\n\nThen assessed the influence of anxiety on information search and knowledge about Covid-19.\nThen evaluated how anxiety altered approval rates of Trump and the CDC.\nFinally, wave 4 is used to examine who the respondent will vote for in the election.\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nAnxiety about real-world events can decouple partisans’ policy positions from those of their party leaders. Once citizensenter the voting booth, however, their ability to assessaccountability and mete out electoral reward or punishment remains deeply affected by partisanship even underpandemic conditions.\nfear of gettingsick with COVID-19 can lead citizens to adopt policypositions contrary to party cues.\nthe results suggest that anxiety does encourage individuals to pursue accuracy-motivated reasoning, even on a highly politicized issue\nanxiety encourages individuals to seekout new information, to eschew habitual elite cues, and process what they learn with the goal of achieving accuracy, rather than rationalizing partisan talking points.\nAt the lowest levels of fear, respondents’ vote intentions were strongly associated with their party identification.\nAs fear increased, probability to vote Trump decreases.\n\neffect is not as much as the effect of fear on policy preferences (mask mandates, etc.)\n\nIndependents were more affected by fear.\nfear of severe illness did little to attenuate the effect of partisanship on vote choice.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI don’t like the way it discusses elite cues.\n\nthere were so many cues from everywhere all at once.\nThere is also a potential lag going on between cues and individual.\n\nVery similar to the Charlie Hebdo article we read in comparative."

    "text": "Hopkins, Dan, Yphtach Lelkes and Samuel Wolken. 2024. “The Rise of and Demand for Identity-Oriented Media Coverage,” American Political Science Review.\nI like this one!\n\nAbstract:\nWhile some assert that social identities have become more salient in American media coverage, existing evidence is largely anecdotal. An increased emphasis on social identities has important political implications, including for polarization and representation. We first document the rising salience of different social identities using natural language processing tools to analyze all tweets from 19 media outlets (2008–2021) alongside 553,078 URLs shared on Facebook. We then examine one potential mechanism: Outlets may highlight meaningful social identities—race/ethnicity, gender, religion, or partisanship—to attract readers through various social and psychological pathways. We find that identity cues are associated with increases in some forms of engagement on social media. To probe causality, we analyze 3,828 randomized headline experiments conducted via Upworthy. Headlines mentioning racial/ethnic identities generated more engagement than headlines that did not, with suggestive evidence for other identities. Identity-oriented media coverage is growing and rooted partly in audience demand.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nMore engagement/demand with articles that include identities in headlines.\n\n\nResearch Question:\n\nHave social identities become more prominent in the political information environment?\nDo the same stories generate more engagement when framed with identity-oriented language?\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\nMedia coverage of social identities has grown in recent decades as outlets adopt identity-oriented coverage strategies (production of identity-oriented content)\nOn social media, news content referencing core social identities is especially likely to generate engagement (audience level reaction to content)\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nVoters may make different voting decisions when the salience of key issues changes\n\nWhat explains changes in salience?\n\nA major argument says the media.\n\n\nThe media may be devoting more coverage to identity driven media coverage\n\nhowever, we don’t know if that is true\n\npuzzle!\n\n\nMechanism of focus: audience demand\nReal time data metrics and a highly fragmented and competitive media market is in part what has led to changes in media coverage.\nEconomic incentives for media companies to publish this content because it gains more engagement.\nTheory: reliance on audience metrics has increased identity-oriented media.\nWhy do social identity coverage generate audience engagement?\n\nSocial identities serve as filters in a complex information environment, helping individuals identify relevant and actionable information.\nsocial identities often serve as a foundation for coordination and collective action\nsocial identity cues help individuals understand the applicable group norms in specific contexts\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nAll tweets from 19 American media outlets (2008-2021; n = 6,235,014)\nMedia outlet URLs shared by Facebook users (2017-2020; n = 553,078)\nNews website Upworthy assigned different headlines to different people of similar stories (2013-2015)\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nPosts with identity-related contenthave higher levels of expressive and social engagement (measured via liking and sharing) than those without it.\nDifferent outlets are shown to invoke different identities more frequently than others.\nSince 2007, mentions of racial and partisan identities on Twitter have roughly tripled.\nPartisan identities appear in a large proportion of Facebook posts, and the prevalence of other identities in news URLs posted on Facebook is roughly 2–5 percentage points higher, depending on the identity category\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThis is an interesting article\nI think it fits nicely with other supply/demand explanations of media\n\nsee Kevin Munger"

We propose a new measure of a member’s legislative effectiveness that covers both chambers from 1873 to 2010 and incorporates all 1.1 million introduced bills, opening up a wide range of new opportunities for examining legislative institutions and behavior across this long historical period. To pursue this, we theorize and empirically examine how the determinants of a member’s legislative effectiveness hinge on legislative institutions. While uncovering consistent results with the existing literature that has focused on the period starting in the early 1970s, we find striking differences when examining earlier periods. For instance, we find that ideological moderates have higher effectiveness relative to extremists before 1975, whereas the importance of majority-party membership increases dramatically from 1947.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\nWe made a new legislative efficiency score that tells us stuff about political history.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nWhat does it mean to be an effective lawmaker?\n\n“The proven ability to advance a member’s agenda items through the legislative process and into law” (Volden & Wiseman 2014)\n\nThey are creating a new way to measure members’ legislative efficiency\nPrimarily focused on role of committee chairs, majority parties, and ideological distance to chamber medians.\nRule changes + organizational changes separate the legislative eras.\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\n\n\nWhich factors the authors expect will have the most impact on legislative efficiency in different eras.\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\nCreate a member-level measure of effectiveness by considering the totality of bills that are introduced into Congress within a term.\n1873-2010\nCreate bill level measure to weigh importance of a bill.\n1.1 million bills\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nBetween the 1890s and 1946, we find that ideological extremism harms a members legislative effectiveness.\nAfter 1947, we find clear advantages for majority party members.\nthe effect of ideological distance on legislative effectiveness disappears from the mid 1970s, coinciding with the increasingly pronounced roles of political parties and committee chairs.\nWe also find that committee chairs tend to have higher effectiveness, with the effect being largest during the Textbook Congress in the House while staying stable in the Senate.\nSeparate 1873-2010 into four regimes:\n\nEarly (1873-1888)\nPre-War (1889-1946)\nTextbook Congress (1947-1974)\nPost-Reform (1975-2010)"

    "text": "Levendusky, Matt, et al. 2024. “Has the Supreme Court Become Just Another Political Branch? Public Perceptions of Court Approval and Legitimacy in a Post-Dobbs World,” Science.\n\nAbstract:\nHave perceptions of the U.S. Supreme Court polarized, much like the rest of American politics? Because of the Court’s unique role, for many years, it remained one of the few institutions respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But the Court’s dramatic shift to the right in recent years—highlighted by its Dobbs decision in 2022—potentially upends that logic. Using both eight waves of panel data and 18 nationally representative surveys spanning two decades, we show that while there was little evidence of partisan polarization in earlier years, in 2022 and 2023, such patterns are clear in favorability, trust, legitimacy, and support for reform. Factors that used to protect the Court—like knowledge about it and support for key democratic values—no longer do so. The Court has also become more important to voters, and will likely remain a political flashpoint, with disquieting implications for the Court’s place in our polity.\n\n\nBumper Sticker:\n\n\nResearch Question:\nHas the Supreme Court become politicized and lost legitimacy in recent years?\n\n\nBackground:\n\nCourt needs legitimacy\nNo legitimacy = no power\n\nweakest branch\n\nReservoir of good will over time\nHowever, court has lurched farther to the right and acted more politically.\nFavorability \\(\\neq\\) Legitimacy\nDobbs overturns Roe v. Wade\n\nProbably the biggest decision in recent Court history.\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\n18 nationally represented surveys spanning nearly two decades\nPanel data\n8 wave panel dataset\n\n\n\nResults:\n\nCourt has lost legitimacy and favorability\nDemocrats see court as less legitimate and this has persisted over time.\nDobbs really messed up the courts legitimacy\nPeople more informed and knowledgeable about courts have lost legitimacy\nIncrease support for court reforms.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThis seems like the same article that Gibson wrote about the effect of Dobbs.\n\nImproves upon the Gibson article in three ways:\n\npanel data availability\ntiming of panel data allows flexibility in regards to the Dobbs leak\ndata goes into 2023 allowing study of overtime Dobbs effect rather than immediate effect."

R is somewhat similar in that it gives us the same capabilities. However, R is much more powerful, flexible, and can evaluate more data than Excel. Unfortunately, what we get in power and flexibility, we trade off in user experience as there is a bit of a learning curve."

HOWEVER, you should always indent your code to keep it clean and readable. R will usually automatically indent for you. This concept becomes clearer as you code more.\nR executes code from the top down.\nYOU SHOULD ALWAYS COMMENT YOUR CODE!\n\nYou will forget what your code does sometimes. It is important to add comments so that you can remember what the code actually does.\n\n“#” allows you to comment your code. You can type anything after the # and R studio will not execute that code (it basically skips over it). See example below\n\nx &lt;- \"Hello World\"\n# anything I write after the \"#\" will not be executed\nprint(x) # this code will tell R to print the object x. \n\n[1] \"Hello World\""

You need to tell it EXACTLY what to do or else, it won’t work. Leaving your files in your default download folder will cause you extreme headache down the road. To prevent this, we are going to create a new folder on your desktop (or somewhere else that works better for you). You should label it “PSCI_2075”. When you download and save files for this class, you should save it within the PSCI_2075 file.\nThink of folders as a Russian Doll. We need our file system to be organized because we have to tell our computer what we want R to look at.

    "section": "R Basics:",
    "text": "R Basics:\n\nObject: R’s way of storing data in its memory, comparable to containers for physical things. Everything that exists in R is an object.\n\nHow do we create an object?\n\nIn R, we use “&lt;-”\n\nTry creating an object in your Source pane. What happens?\n\n\n\nFunctions: perform a defined sequence of actions. Functions are like verbs, we are telling R to take some object (noun) and do something with it.\n\nThere are literally a million functions. You do not need to memorize them.\n\n\n\nx &lt;- c(2,3,6,8,21,2,67,8) # create a numerical vector and call it \"x\" \nsum(x) # sum() is the function. \n\n[1] 117\n\nrange(x) # range() is another function. Look at the repsective outputs\n\n[1]  2 67\n\n\n\nArguments:\n\nArguments are the parameters of the function\nThe functions above are rather simple but what happens when we have functions that we need to specify a bit more?\n\nwe give the function arguments.\n\n\n\nx &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 2)\nx\n\n [1]  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\n# create a sequence of numbers starting at value 2, going until 20 and count by 2. Then assign it as an object \"x\". \n\nThe code above articulates what an argument is. I am telling the function how I want it to be executed.\n\ny &lt;- seq(10, 100, 5)\ny\n\n [1]  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90  95 100\n\n# note that you don't need to specific from, to, and by. The order is predetermined. Although it is good convention so you can better read what your code is doing. \n\nBut Stone, how do we know what the arguments for the function are?! Good question! Every function has different arguments. The “help” section in the output/file pane will help you here. Go to that section and type in the search bar the name of your function. It will provide that arguments for you. You can also type “?seq” into the console and it will automatically take you to the help file for that function.\n\n\nTypes of objects:\nKnowing your object type/class is important. What if we have a bunch of numbers that are strings and we want to add them. We can’t do that because R is treating them as characters and not numbers! There are ways to change the object type. I will introduce that concept at a later point. For now, just familiarize yourself with the object types.\n\nString\n\nanything in between ” “.\n\nx &lt;- \"1, 2, 3, 4\"\ny &lt;- \"yee-haw\"\nz &lt;- \"1 one, 2 two, 3 three, (&gt;_&lt;) - words + symbols...anything between the quotes is a string.\"\nx\n\n[1] \"1, 2, 3, 4\"\n\ny\n\n[1] \"yee-haw\"\n\nz\n\n[1] \"1 one, 2 two, 3 three, (&gt;_&lt;) - words + symbols...anything between the quotes is a string.\"\n\n\n\nNumeric\n\nThese are your integers (and floats - fancy way to say numbers with decimals)\n\nnum_example &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6.2,3.141592654)\nnum_example\n\n[1] 1.000000 2.000000 3.000000 4.000000 5.000000 6.200000 3.141593\n\n\n\nFactor\n\nThink binary - TRUE or FALSE.\n\nVector\n\nThink of a vector as a column or row.\nI’ve already created a few vectors in previous examples. Can you tell me how I did that?\n\nArray\n\nDon’t worry about this right now.\n\nMatrix\n\nDon’t worry about this right now.\n\n\n\n\nLibraries:\nR has “base” functions. Think of this in car terms, you buy a standard version and it comes with the basics. But now you want to go offroading and you need bigger tires. So, you go out and upgrade your stock car and buy bigger tires. Libraries are the same thing. Stock R might not have what we need, so we add a library that gives us new capabilities. There are libraries that you will almost always use. We will discuss what they are and what they do.\n\nPopular libraries:\n\nTidyverse - this the one you will almost always use. It is a big library with a bunch of other smaller libraries within it.\nHaven - this will help with importing data.\nForeign - another library used to import data.\nThere are so many more but these will be the ones you probably see the most.\n\n\n\nInstalling libraries:\n\nYou only have to install them once.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\") # run this code and you will have installed tidyverse. You will never need to run this code again. \n\nJust because you have it installed does not mean R will automatically recognize it. You need to call it up or “invoke” its use. Generally, you just do this at the top of your script.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nCongrats! You now have the functionality of tidyverse within your R session.\n\n\n\n\nSaving:\n\nWhen you are done in R studio. You need to save your work and organize it appropriately.\nName the file 2024-09-05_R_Lab_1\nWhether you are on PC or Mac, go to File &gt; Save As &gt; Desktop &gt; PSCI_2075\n\nyour file is now stored in the folder we created earlier.\n\nNow close out of R completely (click no. Clicking yes is a bad habit that is clunky and uses a lot of memory for your computer)\nReopen R by clicking the file you just saved in the folder.\nAfter you initially save, a simple save after you are done will suffice. (Command S is the shortcut for Mac, Ctrl S is the shortcut for PC)"
