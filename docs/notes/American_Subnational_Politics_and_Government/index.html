<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
<p>The reallocation of authority upward, downward, and sideways from central states has drawn attention from a growing number of scholars in political science. Yet beyond agreement that governance has become (and should be) multi-level, there is no consensus about how it should be organized. This article draws on several literatures to distinguish two types of multi-level governance. One type conceives of dispersion of authority to general-purpose, non-intersecting, and durable jurisdictions. A second type of governance conceives of task-specific, intersecting, and flexible jurisdictions. We conclude by specifying the virtues of each type of governance.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This debate is generally framed between “consolidationists” and “fragmentationalists”.</p></li>
<li><p>Diffusion of decision making away from central state raises fundamental issues of design, conceptualized into two types of governance.</p></li>
<li><p>Tiebout: claims that competition among multiple local jurisdictions leads to more efficient provision of local public services.</p></li>
<li><p>The literatures all share a common postulate: dispersion of governance across multiple jurisdictions is more flexible than concentration of governance in on jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Economies of scale are more likely to characterize the production of capital-intensive public goods than of labor-intensive services because economies accrue from spreading costs over larger outputs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Large scale jurisdictions make sense for the capital intensive public goods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Centralized gov. is not well suited to accommodate diversity.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexible governance must be multi-level.</p>
<ul>
<li>no consensus as to how multi-level governance should be structured.</li>

<ul>

<li><p>intellectual foundation is federalism</p></li>
<li><p>These jurisdictions - international, national, regional, meso, local - are general purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>They bundle together a range of policy responsibilities and, in many cases, a court system and representative institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Every citizen is located in a Russian Doll set of nested jurisdictions, where there is only and only one relevant jurisdiction at any particular territorial scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>General-Purpose Jurisdictions</p>
<ul>
<li>general purpose means they bundle together multiple functions, including a range of policy responsibilities.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>These types both diffuse authority away from the central government.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 1 - bundles competencies in jurisdictions at a limited number of territorial level, and the units at each level are perfectly nested within those at the next higher level.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Voice rather than to exit</p></li>
<li><p>Maximize the fit between the scale of a jurisdiction and the optimal scale of public good provision while minimizing inter-jurisdictional coordination by (a) creating inclusive jurisdictions that internalize most relevant externalizes and )b limiting the number of jurisdictional levels.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Type 2 - limits the transaction costs of inter-jurisdictional coordination, but it does so in a fundamentally different way, by splicing public good provision into a large number of functionally discrete jurisdictions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>each is designed to address a limited set of related problems.</p></li>
<li><p>task-driven.</p></li>
<li><p>membership tends to be conditional and extrinsic.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The constitution only references one element of federalism - a limited national government - in a more general system of governance.</p></li>
<li><p>Hamilton reformulates a confederation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Articles of Confed fail. Hamilton argues individuals are the basic elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Ostrom thinks Hamilton’s reformulation of the concept of confederation is an essential attribute of a federal system of government.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hamilton’s conception:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>each unit of government must be able to articulate the aspirations of people, respond to the demands of individuals, and enforce its resolutions with regard to individuals, not to collectivities as such. Each unit would be autonomous in itself and have both executive and judicial authorities to enforce its resolutions as laws.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Still ambiguity in the meaning of federalism. What shape does it have?</p></li>
<li><p>All federal systems have reference to multiple units of government, each of which has an autonomous existence.</p></li>
<li><p>Federalism is generally between state and fed gov BUT states also practice federalism through incorporation of municipalities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How people think and relate to one another is a most fundamental feature in the governance of human affairs.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Tocqueville considers three types of factors to be important in understanding how a society functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ostrom agrees!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tocqueville concludes these three factors causes which tend to maintain democracy in America.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>first: “the peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence” places people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ostrom considers this to refer to the environmental and material conditions that are available to people in fashioning their lives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>second: “the laws”</p>
<ul>
<li>Ostrom considers this to refer to institutions - the working rules of going concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>third: the “manners and customs of the people.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Habits of the heart” and to “the mass of those ideas which shape their character of mind”</p>
<ul>
<li>Ostrom considers those to mean the manners and customs to include habits of thought - cognition.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Through these three points, we can understand the relationship of federalism to democracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Ostrom focuses on Tocqueville’s statement about how government operating is kinda invisible. Tocqueville is taken aback by this because the french government administration is visible in maintaing the tutelage over French society.</p></li>

<li><p>policies emerge from the interaction of multiple centers of authority than to presume that they are made by some single center of ultimate authority.</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is a shared community of understanding and a reasonable level of consensus about how to address common problems, people will exercise a significant influence in monitoring, facilitating, and constraining one another behavior rather than presuming that it is only governments that govern.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Government in a democratic society, then, is not simply a matter of command and control but of providing multiple structures that have reference to diverse methods of problem solving!!!!!!! p.17</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Together these methods enable people to process conflict in peaceful and constructive ways and to search out more effective ways of achieving resolutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>People have diverse interests but they work out effective complementarities of interest to achieve interdependent communities of interest.

<li>they must be accompanied by habits of the heart and mind that encourage the use of problem-solving.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>p.51 he basically says exactly what is happening now and that stalemate and how “one’s neighbors become one’s enemies.” can still occur.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>however, he doesn’t really elaborate on it. He kinda does later:</p>
<ul>
<li>“But such arrangements are only workable in a society where people achieve a level of learning, experience, and skill that can best be characterized as a problem-solving culture. In such circumstances, people learn to address one another as colleagues capable of inquiring about puzzles, difficulties, and conflicts under the assumption that communication and enlightenment can enable human beings to avoid the perversities whereby some oppress and exploit others.”</li>

<li><p>more reps = more oligarch - Madison</p></li>
<li><p>“Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates; every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob”</p></li>
<li><p>Sovereignty, conceptualized as the authority to make laws, is divided so that the people of the member republics are subordinate to the authority of the Union with respect to national affairs, but are independent with respect to those governmental prerogatives that apply to the jurisdiction of the separate states or republics. The states, in turn, serve as constituent parts of the national government by their representation in the Senate. Governments do not govern governments as such. Concurrent governments reach to the persons of individuals, including citizens and officials claiming to exercise governmental prerogatives under constitutional authority. These, I assume, are the true defining characteristics of what Madison refers to as a “proper federal system” in essay 51 of The Federalist.</p></li>
<li><p>Tocqueville argues “sovereignty may be defined to be the right of making law.”</p></li>
<li><p>If we draw upon these distinctions, constitutions might be viewed as fundamental laws establishing the terms and conditions of government, and the enactments of governments as ordinary laws. Supreme authority is exercised by the people as they set the terms and conditions of fundamental law by covenanting and combining themselves together into civil bodies politic. It is not governments that are supreme; what is supreme is the constitutional authority of people to establish and alter the terms and conditions of government.</p></li>
<li><p>Governments as such are not supreme. They are subject to fundamental law as formulated in constitutions and alterable by the people engaged in processes of constitutional choice.</p></li>
<li><p>A federal republic includes multiple overlapping units of government that act with reference to individuals rather than governments as such.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>A federal arrangement implies multiple units of government having concurrent jurisdiction. The national government is one of limited jurisdiction but with general competence to govern within that jurisdiction. The states also exercise a limited jurisdiction, with general competence to govern within that jurisdiction. In turn, each set of governments is governed by principles of constitutional law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The conceptual innovation being introduced in the design of a federal system of government is the concurrent operation of a system of compound republics, each of which reaches to persons and citizens. Citizens function collectively, taking decisions of a constitutional nature in establishing the terms and conditions of government; and individually, in exercising the basic prerogatives of persons possessing constitutional rights that are correlated with limits upon governmental authority. This change in conceptualizing the place of individuals in concurrent republics altered the basic fabric in the design of American federal systems of government.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Limits on jurisdiction to individuals are specified by reference to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution and various state constitutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Diamond is thus correct in saying that the authors of The Federalist use the terms “confederation” and “federal” roughly as synonyms.</p></li>
<li><p>Where interests are arrayed against interests, there must exist processes for articulating contending interests and reaching decisions with regard to matters under contention. These are prerogatives to be exercised by people in the choice of elected officials and in making decisions of a constitutional nature. The way that people exercise their prerogatives in using a constitutional system of government will determine whether the limits of constitutional law are effectively maintained.</p></li>

<li><p>Delaware as an example</p>
<ul>
<li><p>not sure how I feel about this.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>doesn’t this create a form of cut-throat competition?</p>
<ul>
<li>if states compete for businesses and continually lower taxes, it might approach zero and thus leave the government without corporate tax revenue? <strong>ask Ken his thoughts.</strong></li>

<li><p>Federalism affects who gets what, where, when, and how.</p></li>
<li><p>Federalism influences the following in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Freedoms and Rights</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Federalism has a mixed record of protecting individual rights</p></li>
<li><p>if something is a right-whether to be free of environmental rules or to marry a gay partner-government should protect the right for all Americans, not just those who happen to live in some of the states.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Democracy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>federalism allows citizens to better control and even resist the national government,</p></li>
<li><p>Madison: “the first and most natural attachment of the people will be to the governments of their respective States”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I find this somewhat suspect in modern times. Attachment to the states seem much more obvious as they existed in a time prior to the formation of the United States. That national culture had not existed yet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>wonder what this means for the nationalization of politics.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask Ken.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>basically federalism gives greater flexibility to address niche problems that can’t be solved with an overarching law.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Innovation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>federalism “enables a people to try experiments which could not safely be tried in a large centralized country.”</p></li>
<li><p>SC Justice Louis Brandeis, “a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”</p></li>
<li><p>Laboratories of Democracy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Prosperity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Barry Weingast contended that the federal system is “market-preserving”, that is, it encouraged capitalist growth because the states have the ability and the will to compete with one another to foster their own internal prosperity. In doing so, they have a strong incentive to keep American economic regulations and taxes within limits that do not discourage investment and business expansion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>see my point about Delaware.</p>
<ul>
<li>Might this foster a form of cut-throat competition.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Author: “I argue that federalism plays an essential role as a battleground for all important American political conflicts</p>
<ul>
<li>duh.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Both parties have used federalism as either a weapon or a shield.</p></li>
<li><p>Federalism endures because it is path dependent.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a tendency for an established way of doing things to become self-reinforcing for most people</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I wonder what Americans think about federalism today.</p>
<ul>
<li>I ask because it seems most Americans are fed up with the slowness of government and seem to want government to be more efficient and thus more likely to support a centralization of power? just a thought idk.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Strategies for change and Federalism:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>constitutional amendments, congressional laws, federal court rulings.</p></li>
<li><p>the concept of layering</p>
<ul>
<li>a tactic of placing new responsibilities on the states to produced desired outcomes, usually in return for a conditional grant of money or some other benefit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Third, reformers who confront obstacles at the state level sometimes try to <em>bypass</em> existing state government and political institutions by energizing new institutions that are more likely to produce the outcomes they seek.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-2-federalism-at-the-founding">Chapter 2: Federalism at the Founding</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>How much central power?</p>
<ul>
<li>this question motivates the founding fathers and pretty much all discussion of federalism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Constitution left an ambiguous boundary between national and state power that has produced endless fights over federalism.</p></li>
<li><p>States for many reasons had different interests.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Slaves were a big part of those diverging interests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Georgia and SC demanded more slaves and the continuation of the trade, but Virginia and NC already had plenty and were more supportive of banning slave imports.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>States seemed to benefit themselves at the expense of others</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shays Rebellion.</p></li>
<li><p>the pursuit of narrow self-interest was making “the situation of this great Country weak, inefficient and disgraceful</p>
<ul>
<li>George Washington said that.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Madison &amp; Hamilton</p>
<ul>
<li><p>believed states should have a minor role</p></li>
<li><p>Madison believed that the states; autonomy, power, and selfish parochialism were the basic flaws in the Confederation government.</p></li>
<li><p>Wanted <strong>Broad Nationalism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virginia plan.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Narrow Nationalism</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Roger Sherman of Connecticut was the big name here.</p></li>
<li><p>Advocated of narrow nationalism</p>
<ul>
<li>wanted a stronger national government, but they wanted specific, narrow new powers rather than the broad authority Madison sought.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Broad v. Narrow showdown aka the convention</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two issues specifically divided the Convention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the states representation in Congress</p></li>
<li><p>the extent of power required by the national government.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Also a debate about sovereignty.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hamilton was basically like “nah, the national government can only have true sovereignty.”</p></li>
<li><p>But others were like “nah bro we can have shared sovereignty between the state and national government.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We eventually get a compromise (The Connecticut plan) - Madison wasn’t there but Sherman was</p>
<ul>
<li>“The delegates, then, designed American federalism by compromising on a series of conflict about the specific powers of the national government. Narrow Nationalism prevailed in protections for state power to tax, maintain a militia, and the commercial power. Broad nationalism prevailed in new national taxing, military, and commercial authority, and in flexible powers that could be expanded in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sherman really wanted militas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“the states might want their militia for defense against invasions and insurrections, and for enforcing obedience to their laws.”</p>
<ul>
<li>lol this flies in the face of 2nd amendment modern interpretation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Constitution firmly established that it and the national laws “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.”</p></li>
<li><p>Constitution gave the national government potentially broad authority to make all laws “necessary and proper” for executing all its enumerated powers.”</p></li>
<li><p>Constitution reflected a vision of broad national government responsibility “to form a more perfect union, to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”</p></li>
<li><p>Constitution needed some TLC to be ratified.</p></li>
<li><p>Tenth amendment was added.</p>
<ul>
<li>tenth provides no guidance about the precise boundary between state and national power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Federalist papers came into existence to argue for the constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>First, The constitution allowed the states to keep the powers of everyday governing, control most of the policy tools for governing everyday American life - local and particular interests.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>diversity lies at the heart of federalism.</p></li>
<li><p>short term interest was very powerful early on.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Second, the constitution authorized the national government to exercise the powers of national sovereignty, that is, the tools of diplomacy, commerce, and national security exercised by other sovereign national governments.</p>
<ul>
<li>states, not the national gov, had and kept the power to govern their own culture, politics, and economy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Third, the ambiguous boundary between state and national power has encouraged political conflict throughout American history.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth, the conflict between national and state turned American federalism into a massive arena of political conflict.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the first battleground - involves whether the government should act to deal with a public problem or not.</p></li>
<li><p>the second battleground - what LEVEL of government should have the power to choose whether to act.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interesting point by Woodrow Wilson:</p>
<ul>
<li>“…It cannot, indeed, be settled by the opinion of anyone one generation because it is a question of growth, and every successive stage of our political and economic development gives it a new aspect.”</li>

<li>interesting. Is this true now?</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-5-federalism-and-american-capitalism">Chapter 5: Federalism and American Capitalism</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>In a capitalist system, private owners, and not the government, own the key means of production (land and natural resources, capital, and labor) and these owners distribute products by exchanging them in free markets.</p></li>
<li><p>Economist Karl Polanyi argued that governments created free markets by actively extending property rights, enforcing business agreements, and breaking down barriers to buying and selling.</p></li>
<li><p>Polanyi identified a <em>double movement</em> in capitalist development:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>constant pressure for unfettered economic growth driven by capitalism</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in America, this kinda wins out.</p></li>
<li><p>The states competing for private enterprise made this more likely to win out.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>and constant pressure to relieve the problems that markets created for many people.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Economic development must be politically viable and efficient as well.</p></li>
<li><p>“Federalism, then, had two effects on the management of American economic growth. First, it allowed those who opposed government efforts to restrict market expansion to dig in behind states’ rights and oppose the expansion of national power to mitigate the effects. Federalism in the United States tended to be”market-preserving”: it limited the ability of American public officials to restrict business and to redistribute wealth from those who profited from capitalism to others. But, second, the very fact that federalism encouraged the growth of strong private enterprises also encouraged a backlash that defined business as a hostile adversary that required strict policing and punishment.</p></li>
<li><p>Hamilton wanted national government to have greater control over econ.</p></li>
<li><p>States provided legal charters for corporations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is important as states had different regulations and taxes</p>
<ul>
<li>this is why everyone is chartered in Delaware.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company</p>

<li><p>Democrats were emboldened to use the federal government to more actively stabilize the capitalist system in the Great Depression.</p></li>
<li><p>National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) - authorized businesses in each major industry to regulate their prices, production, and working conditions, and allowed the Federal government to enforce these agreements.</p>
<ul>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Glass-Steagall Act - required commercial and investment banks to separate, and prohibited commercial banks from underwriting most securities.</p></li>
<li><p>SC eventually retreats from their earlier decision and upheld national power to regulate union organizing, even within a state.</p></li>
<li><p>Pollution regulation is interesting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>initially led by the states. But there is still problems. As William D. Ruckelshaus, the first director of the U.S. EPA notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“My impression in those days was the that pollution was essentially a problem caused by competition among the states for the location of industry within their borders. When we began to enforce pollution laws, they were pretty broad in modern terms and only addressed flagrant pollution. I mean, there were a lot of cities without any sewage treatment and there were industries discharging absolutely untreated material into the waterways, killing fish. But whenever we pushed a major company very hard, there was always the threat they would move to the south where the governors said, in effect,”Come on down here, we don’t care, we need your business, we need jobs.’ My impression was, if you simply centralized all of this oversight and enforcement activity, you could bring such states and governors in line because there wouldn’t be any place for them to run and hide.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>really good quote.</p>
<ul>
<li>further: the Automobile industry got annoyed by all the different state regulations and campaigned for a single federal law to supersede the patchwork of different state rules.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>1980s - businesses mobilized and helped conservative Republicans.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 - repealed New Deal era banking law and preempted states from prohibiting any of the banking activities allowed by Federal Law.</li>

<li><p>states varied wildly</p></li>
<li><p>Roosevelt refused to support health insurance.</p>
<ul>
<li>they thought its inclusion would generate enough opposition to sink the whole plan.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Congress in 1940 wanted a system of grants to the states to set up health insurance, the proposal died because of the opposition of a powerful coalition of interest groups, led by the American Medical Association and the U.S chamber of commerce.</p></li>
<li><p>Alone among the provisions of the Social Security Act, the Federal government would directly manage old-age insurance for retired workers-the program now associated with the term, “Social Security”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Employers and workers in long-term, full-time jobs would make mandatory contributions to a Federally run trust fund.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why not let the states run this?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1) “Congress can’t stand the pressure of the Townsend plan unless we have a real old-age insurance system…”</p></li>
<li><p>2) no state had created a government sponsored old age insurance program, thus no state had innovated on this and no state would probably oppose as a result.</p></li>
<li><p>3) Fed policymakers believed that nationally run social insurance for the elderly would cost less than Fed-state grants for old-age pensions.</p></li>
<li><p>4) American workers frequently moved across state lines.</p></li>
<li><p>5) program excluded domestic workers and agriculture workers, and for that reason, left much of the labor market in the South-particularly its racial composition-undisturbed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>economist seem to scoff at this option (at the time).</p></li>
<li><p>To resort to voice, rather than exit, is for the customer or member to make an attempt at changing the practices, policies, and outputs of the firm from which one buys or of the organization to which one belongs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice is here defined as any attempt at all to change, rather than to escape from, an objectionable state of affairs, whether through individual or collective petititon to the management directly in charge, through appeal to a higher authority with the intention of forcing a change in management, or through various types of actions and protests, including those that are meant to mobilize public opinion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Voice in the realm of politics can backfire.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One reason, stressed by Robert Dahl, is that the ordinary failure, on the part of most citizens, to use their potential political resources to the full makes it possible for them to react with unexpected vigor-by using normally unused reserves of political power and influence-whenever their vital interests are directly threatened.</p>
<ul>
<li>fire quote.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Voice option is the only way to react when exit option is not available.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>role of voice increases as the opportunities for exit decline</p>
<ul>
<li><p>inequities in voice option are real.</p>
<ul>
<li>this to me is especially true in the realm of housing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Three general statements between voice and exit can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) In the simple model presented up to no,v, voice functions as a complement to exit, not as a substitute for it. Whatever voice is forthcoming under those conditions is a net gain from the point of view of the recuperation mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>(2) The more effective voice is (the effectiveness of exit being given), the more quality-inelastic cam demand be without the chances for recuperation stemming from exit and voice combined being impaired.</p></li>
<li><p>(3) Considering that beyond a certain point, exit has a destructive rather than salutary effect, the optimal pattern from the point of view of maximizing the combined effectiveness of exit and voice over the whole process of deterioration may be an elastic response of demand to the first stages of deterioration and an inelastic one for the later stages.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><em>If the matter is put in this way it is immediately evident, however, that the decision whether to exit will often be taken in the light of the prospects for the effective use of voice. *****</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if customers are sufficiently convinced that voice will be effective, then they may well postpone exit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There is a loyalty variable that relates to voice and exit.</p></li>
<li><p>“Voice is costly and conditioned on the influence and bargaining power customers and members can bring to bear within the firm from which they buy or the organizations to which they belong.</p></li>
<li><p>The presence of the exit alternative can therefore tend to atrophy the development of the art of voice.</p></li>

<li><p>“While it is most clearly revealed in the private-public school case, one characteristic is crucial in all of the foregoing situations: those customers who care most about the quality of the product and who, therefore, are those who would be the most active, reliable, and creative agents of voice are for that very reason also those who are apparently likely to exit first in case of deterioration.” p.47</p>
<ul>
<li>this exactly housing and local governance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The crucial point can now be made. For anyone individual, a quality change can be translated into equivalent price change. But this equivalence is frequently different for different customers of the article because appreciation of quality difers widely among them. p.48</p>

<li>a given deterioration in quality will inflict very different losses on different customers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“When general conditions in a neighborhood deteriorate, those who value most highly neighborhood qualities such as safety, cleanliness, good schools, and so forth will be the first to move out; they will search for housing in somewhat more expensive neighborhoods or in the suburbs and will be lost to the citizens’ groups and community action programs that would attempt to stem and reverse the tide of deterioration.” p.51</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Ability to exercise exit or voice is in part dependent on the entity.</p></li>
<li><p>does exit make loyalty less likely? Does it give more scope to voice?</p></li>
<li><p>The importance of loyalty from our point of view is that it can neutralize within certain limits the tendency of the most quality-conscious customers or members to be the first to exit.</p></li>
<li><p>Loyalty is a key concept in the battle between exit and voice not only because, as a result of it, members may be locked into their organizations a little longer and thus use the voice option with greater determination and resourcefulness than would otherwise be the case. It is helpful also because it implies the possibility of disloyalty, that is, exit. Just as it would be impossible to be good in a world without evil, so it makes no sense to speak of being loyal to a firm, a party, or an organization with an unbreakable monopoly. While loyalty postpones exit its very existence is predicated on the possibility of exit. That even the most loyal member can exit is often an important part of his bargaining power vis-a-vis the organization. The chances for voice to function effectively as a recuperation mechanism are appreciably strengthened if voice is backed up by the threat of exit, whether it is made openly or whether the possibility of exit is merely well understood to be an element in the situation by all concerned. p.82</p></li>
<li><p>Two conclusions stand out from this discussion: (1) the detail of institutional design can be of considerable importance for the balance of exit and voice; (2) this balance, in turn, can help account for the varying extent of internal democracy in organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>kinda a problem if you are super loyal but if you threaten exit and the firm gets worse it may hold you back.</p></li>
<li><p>Parents who plan to shift their children from public to private school may thereby contribute to a further deterioration of public education. If they realize this prospective effect of their decision they may end up by not taking it, for reasons of general welfare or even as a result of a private cost-benefit calculation: the lives of both parents and children will be affected by the quality of public education in their community, and if this quality deteriorates the higher educational attainments of the children to be obtained by shifting them to private school have a cost which could be so large as to counsel against the shift.</p></li>
<li><p>Now it can be shown that an invariant or even inverse relationship between these variables is possible. In the case of public goods, the member will compare, at any one point in the process of deterioration, the disutility, discomfort, and shame of remaining a member to the prospective damage which would be inflicted on him as a prospective nonmember and on society at large by the additional deterioration that would occur if he were to get out.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>It is impossible to maximize all such values at once in a finite world. Trade-offs are required, about which community members will often disagree, requiring joint deliberation. Governance as a process is centrally concerned with making these trade-offs.</p>
<ul>

<li><p>The argument I offer below is that polycentric systems of government allow for more open governance structures that include greater “civic space,” defined as the set of opportunities for nongovernmental actors to enter productively into the governance process by producing general benefits for a community.</p>

<p>This article describes the institutional collective action (ICA) framework and its application to the study of governance arrangements in metropolitan areas by focusing on the tools of regional governance for solving ICA problems. Regional governance mechanisms are classified by their focus on either collective or network relationships. The role of these within these mechanisms is analyzed and the transaction costs barriers to the emergence of regional governance institutions are identified. The concluding discussion identifies the limitations of self-organizing mechanisms and develops a research agenda to investigate the emergence, evolution, and performance of regional governance institutions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We argue that there are an array of mechanisms that vary in the extent to which self-organization is evident in their creation and use.</p></li>
<li><p>much of the literature portrays local governments as incapable of overcoming their social, economic, and political differences to address policy spillover problems.</p>

<li>recent empirical evidence strongly refutes these assumptions and suggests that self-organizing governance mechanism can and do coordinate decisions in many policy areans.</li>

</section>
<section id="background-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background-1">Background:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Institutional collective action problems arise directly from the delegation of service responsibilities to a multitude of local governments and authorities.</p></li>
<li><p>vertical vs horizontal collective action problems</p></li>
<li><p>a policy arena is composed of formal policy making venues with statutory authority to make policy decisions processes in each venue, and policy actors who are concerned with these policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Centralized institutions and hierarchy are not the only way of resolving local ICA problems. Locally evolved self-governing institutions that are adapted to specific local circumstances may provide more effective resolution of collective action problems than central intervention in many circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>When governments and agencies in federalist systems encounter collective action problems due to fragmentation, higher level institutions have the authority to. resolve the problems by changing the geographic or functional jurisdiction to internalize the externalities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>regional authorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>these don’t do well.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>non-profits can also help coordinate.</p></li>
<li><p>Most common forms of residual government organizations are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>regional partnership organizations</p></li>
<li><p>regional councils of governments</p></li>
<li><p>metropolitan planning organizations</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Contract networks: link individual units through joint ventures, interlocal agreements, and service contracts that require the consent of those involved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Networks and collective governance mechanisms may solve problems that transcend local political boundaries, but they reflect the participants’ political and economic interests, so problems of conflict and negotiations remain, even after an institution is adopted.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>trust, mutuality, and reputations that are manifestations of closely connected networked relationships facilitate collective action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feiock, Steinacker, and Park (forthcoming) report that a city's demographic similarity with neighbors and centrality in the social networks of local actors increase the likelihood of joint ventures. Spatial proximity also contributes to interdependencies that safeguard cooperative action and provide a larger opportunity set of reliable partners from which to develop new ventures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both strong tie networks of frequent interaction among cities and participation in weak tie associational networks increased the likelihood of development collaboration. These results suggest that collaborative groups that provide venues for local government and other organizations to interact build networks and social capital that contribute to the emergence of self-organizing solutions to metropolitan problems.</li>

<ul>

<li><p>ability of local officials to self-organize is tied to state level rules, the transaction characteristics of goods, the spatial and demographic characteristics of institutional units, and their internal political structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, we expect that intraorganizational and intrajurisdictional homogeneity will increase the likelihood of self-organizing institutions.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>This book asks how segregation becomes entrenched, why its form changes, and what the consequences are.</p>
<ul>
<li>I argue that local governments have generated segregation along race and class lines. Striving to protect property values and exclusive access to high quality public goods, the preferences of white property owners have been institutionalized through the vehicle of local land use policy, shaping residential geography for more than 100 years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The maintenance of property values and the quality of public goods are collective endeavors. And like all collective endeavors, they require collective action for production and stability. Local governments provide this collective action. So, supported by land-oriented businesses, white homeowners have backed a succession of maneuvers to keep their property interests and public benefits insulated from change – even as cities have grown, aged, redeveloped, suburbanized, and adjusted to industrialization. Battles over the control of urban space have always been the primary driver of city politics. At stake is the quality of life accessible to residents and markets available to commercial interests. The result has been <em>segregation by design</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>In the first half of the twentieth century, advantaged and disadvantaged neighborhoods resided within the political boundaries of large central cities. In the second half of the century, when the suburbs captured most of the population growth, the physical and – more importantly – political distance between advantage and disadvantage widened. Today, the most advantaged places are located outside of central cities altogether so that disadvantaged residents have no direct role to play in decisions about building affordable housing, expanding public transportation, or diversifying schools. In these advantaged places, development is restricted and residents are politically conservative; they vote at higher rates for Republican presidential candidates, support low taxes, want limited spending, and see inequality as the result of individual failings.</p></li>

<li><p>Another essential driver of the development of municipal government was the desire to manage increasing racial and ethnic diversity in growing, compact cities.</p></li>

<li><p>others argue its local governance</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In this chapter, I explore the factors that contributed to the adoption of zoning laws. I argue that zoning was enacted by political elites seeking to manage the distribution of public goods to their core supporters.</p></li>
<li><p>As Monkonnen indicates, it was far from obvious that cities would assert control over their environments, but the rapid spread of slums, worries about skyscrapers blocking natural light, fears of conflagration, and concern about public health threats provided early inspiration for cities to invoke their policy power of regulation over nuisances (Toll <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-525">Reference Toll1969</a>).<a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/books/segregation-by-design/engineering-enclaves/24831D246BFCFC2F60B0673C17FBCA90#FN-fn-76">Footnote<sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>zoning is not the same as planning</p></li>
<li><p>As zoning practices spread through the 1920s, emphasis on the enhancement of property values became the dominant argument; almost universally, it was believed that the wrong sorts of people residing, or even working, in an area could negatively impact property values.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, although Jim Crow laws were widespread, most southern cities did not legislate residential segregation directly</p></li>
<li><p>Following <em>Buchanan</em>, many cities sought to enact constitutionally defensible racial zoning plans by turning to comprehensive city planning</p></li>
<li><p>By separating industrial, commercial, and residential uses into separate districts – each with standard regulations regarding the use, height, and area of buildings – zoning would make "every town, city or village a more orderly, convenient, economic and attractive place in which to live and work"</p></li>
<li><p>In <em>Euclid v. Ambler</em> (<a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-598">1926</a>), Justice Sutherland explained that the apartment house is often a "mere parasite, constructed to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings … interfering by their height and build with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the rays of the sun … depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play enjoyed by those in more favored localities … until, finally, the residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a place of detached residences are utterly destroyed. Under these circumstances, apartment houses, which in a different environment would be not only entirely unobjectionable but highly desirable, come very near to being nuisances" (pp.&nbsp;394–95).</p></li>
<li><p>the National Association of Realtors' code of ethics stated, "A Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy, members of any race or nationality, or any individuals who presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood" (Article 34 of Part III).<a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/books/segregation-by-design/engineering-enclaves/24831D246BFCFC2F60B0673C17FBCA90#FN-fn-84">Footnote</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This perspective led to general support for the power of land-use regulation and zoning among real estate interests. Writing in 1924, Herbert Flint, a town planner from Cleveland, Ohio, explained that zoning plans should be developed by local planning commissions, populated with "those well-positioned in real estate, the law, banking, manufacturing and transportation; also representative citizens who would safeguard the interests of the homeowners"</strong></li>

<li><p>My dependent variables in these analyses are <em>change</em> in the level of <em>race</em> and <em>class segregation</em> between about 1900 and 1970.</p></li>
<li><p>I expect that racial segregation will be most closely linked to racial and comprehensive zoning (as the historical discussion indicated), while class segregation will be tied to all forms of zoning. In the analysis of racial segregation, my independent variable is a dummy variable noting whether a city adopted either a race-based or comprehensive zoning ordinance in the period between 1900 and 1930. These <em>early zoning adopters</em> are coded 1, and cities that did not adopt racial or comprehensive zoning are coded 0.</p></li>

<li><p>In 1917, the Supreme Court ruled racial zoning ordinances unconstitutional.

New comprehensive city plans were fueled by continuing race and class prejudice, and influenced the long-term shift from racial segregation to segregation by income level.</p></li>

<li><p>sewer and water lines are important in segregation tactics.</p></li>
<li><p>My theory predicts that nonwhite and renter households would have been less likely to have access to water and sewer connections in more segregated cities.</p></li>
<li><p>The dependent variable in the analysis is the <em>total new segments</em> built in each ward before the next census.</p></li>
<li><p>The key independent variables are the share of each ward's total population that is <em>black</em> and the share of occupied housing units that were <em>rented</em> (as opposed to owned).

<li><p><strong>The data indicate that in more segregated cities, heavily black and renter wards were unlikely to receive new sewer lines.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>local politics is a battle over space</p></li>
<li><p>One of the few powers reserved, nearly exclusively, by local government is that of zoning or planning. When a city is residentially segregated by race, issues cleave along racial and not just spatial lines (Massey and Denton <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-352">Reference Massey and Denton1998</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Neighborhood racial isolation is associated with a high degree of racial intolerance, resentment, and competition among all racial groups (Oliver <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-409">Reference Oliver2010</a>).</p>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><p>However, living in different types of neighborhoods may also change individuals' perspectives. In integrated neighborhoods, regular, casual interaction may work to counteract dominant, negative stereotypes</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>The result of both population sorting and neighborhood influence is that individuals who live in homogeneous neighborhoods are more likely to harbor negative stereotypes about other groups</p>
<ul>
<li>ENOS</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Because segregation represents preferences or attitudes that are incompatible with collective investment, the uneven distribution of groups, not diversity per se, correlates with lower public goods spending.</p></li>

<li><p>more segregated cities are also more politically polarized</p></li>
<li><p>As the third column reveals, the relationship between segregation and polarization appears to be unaffected by the conservatism of the white population.

<li><p>does segregation make it harder to reach consensus?</p>
<ul>
<li>if so, we should also see less support for government spending in segregated cities after accounting for racial demographics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>segregation and public goods spending are negatively related, even in the presence of changing demographics, diverse populations, and conservative residents.</p></li>
<li><p>spending on public goods is lower in cities with greater segregation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>At low levels of segregation, white turnout is much higher than minority turnout, but the lines converge as segregation increases. Furthermore, using the racial polarization dataset described in the first section of this chapter, I find that turnout and segregation are positively correlated in the aggregate. These patterns strongly suggest that politics is more contentious in more segregated communities. Thus, a lack of participation by residents who support high spending is not likely to be the cause of lower public goods investment.</strong></p>

<li><p>the vast majority of funding to reduce overflows comes from local sources</p></li>
<li><p>that more segregated cities will have more trouble coming to political consensus about public goods provision, then we ought to expect more segregated cities to witness more sewer overflows – all else equal.c</p></li>
<li><p><em>logged overflows per 1,000 persons</em> measure serves as my dependent variable</p></li>
<li><p>My main independent variable is the city's <em>H</em> index of racial segregation, measured in 2000, if available, and 2010 if not</p></li>
<li><p>The data reveal a significant correlation between segregation and sewer overflows. Living in a city with very little segregation, one can expect about 1.5 overflows per year on average. This increases to nearly 2.5 overflows in cities at the ninety-fifth percentile of the segregation distribution. Not only do segregated cities see lower spending on public goods, but they also witness worse performance as well.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Segregation between neighborhoods has declined BUT segreagtion between cities has remained stable and even rose.</p></li>
<li><p>In previous chapters, I argued that segregation was pursued by local governments to enhance property values and target local public goods toward white homeowners and land-oriented businesses. Such strategies, combined with political control of city councils and mayors' offices, ensured that local governments operated to protect the homogeneity of white homeowner neighborhoods, and provide them with disproportionate benefits.</p></li>
<li><p>In this chapter, I analyze the relationships between cities within metropolitan areas. I concentrate on the ways in which the politics of the central city (the city with the largest population in the metro area) and the pull of suburban opportunities affect demographic residential patterns in the metro area.</p></li>

<li><p>People choose where they live based on the services they provide.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>however, not all residents are equally able to match these preferences with housing location</p>
<ul>
<li>critique of Tiebout.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The rapid increase in the population of the suburbs during the postwar period was mostly not the result of white flight. Rather, rising incomes, low-cost, federally backed mortgages, the lucrative federal mortgage deduction, new housing construction in suburban tracts, and an extensive highway system all worked to bring residents to the periphery</p></li>
<li><p>"[T]he increased heterogeneity of suburbia as a whole is usually not matched by a greater diversification <em>within</em> particular suburbs. There are now more poor and working-class people, more minorities and more industrial and commercial sites in suburbia. But poorer, working-class or black suburbanites are likely to live in different jurisdictions separate from those inhabited by affluent or white suburbanites"</p></li>
<li><p>Overt racism has decreased dramatically over the last several decades (Schuman et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-479">Reference Schuman, Steeh and Bobo1997</a>), but whites continue to express a preference for same-race neighbors (Charles <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-90">Reference Charles2003</a>) and minority neighborhoods continue to be perceived as having poor-quality amenities (Bobo, Kluegel, and Smith <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-50">Reference Bobo, Kluegel, Smith, Tuch and Martin1997</a>; Ellen <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-143">Reference Ellen2000</a>; Emerson, Chai, and Yancey <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-147">Reference Emerson, Chai and Yancey2001</a>; Krysan <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-306">Reference Krysan2002</a>; Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillian <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-29">Reference Bayer, Ferreira and McMillan2007</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Why, even as neighborhoods have grown more integrated, have cities become less so? The answer is politics and political control.</p></li>
<li><p>If an individual holds negative stereotypes of racial minorities, she is likely to oppose government expenditures, especially when she believes that there is a racial disparity in who shoulders the tax burden and in who benefits from public services</p></li>
<li><p><strong>This chapter shows that suburban sorting along race and class lines is linked to central city elections of minority mayors, larger city budgets, and a greater share of spending on police. It is also linked to greater use of land-use regulations in the suburbs and availability of suburban school districts.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Neighborhoods that successfully defended their white homeowner turf, despite the massive demographic and policy transformations of the postwar period, became the locus of modern conservatism.</p>
<ul>
<li>argument made by suburban warriors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>In this chapter, I begin by linking white residential spaces in 1970 to three important neighborhood characteristics: property values, single-family homeownership, and the whiteness of public schools. Then, I provide evidence that the relative whiteness of a neighborhood in 1970 is a powerful predictor of political attitudes and loyalties today. People who live in places that were whiter than their metropolitan area was in 1970 were more likely to vote for the Republican presidential candidate in 2008 and are more conservative than their individual attributes (e.g., race, gender, marital status, age, education, income, presence of children) would otherwise predict.</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Why would living in a neighborhood that was white in 1970 affect political views in 2008?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the whiteness of a neighborhood could produce individual-level conservatism through two different mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>nonrandom migration of individuals into or out of whiter neighborhoods (sorting/selection)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>conservative people moved to white neighborhoods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill bishop argument.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>or by directly affecting the ideology of residents.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Particular types of places can generate distinctive preferences as a result of features of the place, like population density or community size (Rodden <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-464">Reference Rodden2011</a>; Gainsborough <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-192">Reference Gainsborough2001</a>; Ogorzalek <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-406">Reference Ogorzalek2018</a>; Oliver <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-408">Reference Oliver2001</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>That is, if your neighborhood is very dense, you may be more inclined to see the need for rodent control or sewage treatment. Places can also magnify the individual attributes of inhabitants – such as when minority neighborhoods lack elite networks (Wilson <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-570">Reference Wilson1987</a>; Widestrom <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-564">Reference Widestrom2015</a>). Neighborhood homogeneity might breed racial hostility and intolerance due to a lack of exposure to or contact with neighbors of different backgrounds (Oliver and Mendelberg <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-410">Reference Oliver and Mendelberg2000</a>; Oliver and Wong <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-412">Reference Oliver and Wong2003</a>). Additionally, past political experiences can shape current views.</p></li>
<li><p>Patterns of race relations developed during early periods of American history can generate opinions and behaviors that are transmitted over time and remain detectable in modern politics (Hersh and Nall <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-249">Reference Hersh and Nall2016</a>). Such distinctive political attitudes are communicated through processes like neighborhood social interaction (Huckfeldt and Sprague <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-261">Reference Huckfeldt and Sprague1995</a>) and/or "low-intensity cues" – such as the casual observation of ones' neighbors (Cho and Rudolph <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-95">Reference Cho and Rudolph2008</a>). More straightforwardly, it seems reasonable to suspect that moving to a neighborhood with high property values and good schools leads homeowners to become obsessively concerned with keeping those values high and the schools good.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>both of these mechanisms are probably at play.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What I demonstrate is that neighborhood traits from the 1970s are associated with conservatism at aggregate, and individual levels are above and beyond the mobility of the population and the demographic makeup of the neighborhood today.</p></li>

<li><p>Tradition segregation was explicit</p></li>
<li><p>Laws change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Homeowners will talk about increased traffic, limited open space, or a change in the feel of the neighborhood as reasons for their opposition to development. They'll talk about their right to protect their neighborhoods and their schools from increased crime, property degradation, or poor academic performance. But they do not, usually, say that they want to limit the presence of black, Latino, or poor neighbors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Because the Republican Party protected defenders' rights to choose their neighbors, it won their allegiance.</p></li>
<li><p>Residents who live in defended neighborhoods today are more likely to identify as Republicans and more likely to vote for Republican presidential candidates. The local roots of modern conservatism are deep.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-10-concluding-thoughts-and-new-designs">Chapter 10: Concluding Thoughts and New Designs</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>As Peterson (<a href="https://www-cambridge-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/core/product/identifier/9781108555722%23EMT-rl-1/type/BOOK_PART#REFe-r-423">Reference Peterson1981</a>), explained, local politics is "above all the politics of land use" (p.&nbsp;25).</p></li>
<li><p>I argue that the policies that generate segregation and racial inequality are driven fundamentally by whites' economic and political self-interest, which both interact with and produce racist beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Segregation by Design</em> asserts that across time and place, white property owners have achieved power, access, and policy that is unrepresentative of their share of the population. They turn out to vote at higher rates and dominate decision-making bodies. As a result, political outcomes at the local level are not pluralistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher levels of government have disrupted white property owners' power. Mobilization among people of color has limited their power too. <em>Segregation by Design</em> tells this story. Of course, there are still many unanswered questions. To start, this book has neglected to interrogate how property owners differ from one another across time and place, and has completely ignored the role and agency of property owners of color. What happens when neighborhood property owners conflict with residential developers? What determines who wins? We need to know how variation in goals and perspectives may affect land-use policy, segregation, and inequality.</p></li>
<li><p>State and federal governments can compel desegregation on various fronts.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, desegregating neighborhoods and schools is likely to require stripping, to some degree, local control. At a minimum, going forward, states could analyze school district and municipality incorporation with an eye toward integration, limiting fragmentation and opportunities for segregation. Importantly, states can also require the building of multifamily housing, although this latter solution may only serve to increase segregation within cities if exclusive suburbs shove multifamily housing into concentrated neighborhoods.</p></li>
