<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Moderates are often overlooked in contemporary research on American voters. Many scholars who have examined moderates argue that these individuals are only classified as such due to a lack of political sophistication or conflicted views across issues. We develop a method to distinguish three ways an individual might be classified as moderate: having genuinely moderate views across issues, being inattentive to politics or political surveys, or holding views poorly summarized by a single liberal–conservative dimension. We find that a single ideological dimension accurately describes most, but not all, Americans’ policy views. Using the classifications from our model, we demonstrate that moderates and those whose views are not well explained by a single dimension are especially consequential for electoral selection and accountability. These results suggest a need for renewed attention to the middle of the American political spectrum.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-1">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Contemporary American politics has been largely characterized by hyper partisanship and polarization, with partisan-motivated reasoning a thematic concern. Theories of emotions in politics suggest that anxiety might interrupt partisan heuristics and encourage citizens to reason more evenhandedly—but in what domains and to what extent? We use original panel data to assess how anxiety about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 interacted with partisan attachments to shape political judgment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The structure of our data allows us to assess large-scale implications of politically relevant emotions in ways that so far have not been possible. We find large effects on policy attitudes: Republicans who were afraid of getting sick rejected signals from copartisan leaders by supporting mask mandates and the like. Effects on vote choice for Republicans were muted in comparison, but fear’s large effect on independents may have been pivotal.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-2">Abstract:</h3>
<p>While some assert that social identities have become more salient in American media coverage, existing evidence is largely anecdotal. An increased emphasis on social identities has important political implications, including for polarization and representation. We first document the rising salience of different social identities using natural language processing tools to analyze all tweets from 19 media outlets (2008–2021) alongside 553,078 URLs shared on Facebook. We then examine one potential mechanism: Outlets may highlight meaningful social identities—race/ethnicity, gender, religion, or partisanship—to attract readers through various social and psychological pathways. We find that identity cues are associated with increases in some forms of engagement on social media. To probe causality, we analyze 3,828 randomized headline experiments conducted via Upworthy. Headlines mentioning racial/ethnic identities generated more engagement than headlines that did not, with suggestive evidence for other identities. Identity-oriented media coverage is growing and rooted partly in audience demand.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-3">Abstract:</h3>
<p>A key concept in American legislative politics is the extent to which members are effective, i.e.&nbsp;have the ability to propose and advance bills on important topics in Congress. We propose a new measure of a member’s legislative effectiveness that covers both chambers from 1873 to 2010 and incorporates all 1.1 million introduced bills, opening up a wide range of new opportunities for examining legislative institutions and behavior across this long historical period. To pursue this, we theorize and empirically examine how the determinants of a member’s legislative effectiveness hinge on legislative institutions. While uncovering consistent results with the existing literature that has focused on the period starting in the early 1970s, we find striking differences when examining earlier periods. For instance, we find that ideological moderates have higher effectiveness relative to extremists before 1975, whereas the importance of majority-party membership increases dramatically from 1947.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-4">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Have perceptions of the U.S. Supreme Court polarized, much like the rest of American politics? Because of the Court’s unique role, for many years, it remained one of the few institutions respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But the Court’s dramatic shift to the right in recent years—highlighted by its <em>Dobbs</em> decision in 2022—potentially upends that logic. Using both eight waves of panel data and 18 nationally representative surveys spanning two decades, we show that while there was little evidence of partisan polarization in earlier years, in 2022 and 2023, such patterns are clear in favorability, trust, legitimacy, and support for reform. Factors that used to protect the Court—like knowledge about it and support for key democratic values—no longer do so. The Court has also become more important to voters, and will likely remain a political flashpoint, with disquieting implications for the Court’s place in our polity.</p>

<li><p>When we make judgments about the president, what exactly are we evaluating?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the President’s influence on governmental action?</p>

<li>His strength and weakness, then, turns on his personal capacity to influence the conduct of the men who make up the government.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>power means influence</p></li>
<li><p>Two ways to study political power:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one way: focus on tactics of influencing certain men in given situations</p></li>
<li><p>other way: what can this man accomplish to improve the prospect that he will have influence when he wants it? What is its nature and what are its resources?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>what he does to boost his chance of mastery in any instance, looking toward tomorrow from today</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>this way is the focus of the book.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Focus: Eisenhower, Truman, FDR</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>President is an invaluable clerk. President can be used by members of congress to help themselves - his actions are useful in their business.</p></li>
<li><p>People look to the president to do something on everything</p>

<li><p><strong>Presidential power is the power to persuade</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>see example with Eisenhower.</p></li>
<li><p>not all results can be achieved through orders given by the presidency.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Look at three events to illustrate point:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MacArthur Dismissal</p></li>
<li><p>Steel mill strikes</p></li>
<li><p>Little Rock School integration.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Seems to be discussing principle-agent issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Embedded within these three events is a host of other factors used by the president to help ensure they exert influence in their action</p>
<ul>
<li><p>president involvement was unambiguous</p></li>
<li><p>so were his words</p></li>
<li><p>order was widely publicized</p></li>
<li><p>men receiving order had control of everything to carry out</p></li>
<li><p>no doubt of authority</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Favorable factors that ensure compliance more in depth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First factor: a presidential order is assurance the president has spoken.</p>
<ul>
<li>given by the man himself</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Second factor: Clarity about his meaning (of order)</p></li>
<li><p>Third factor: Publicity of directive.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth factor: the directive is actually able to be carried out.</p></li>
<li><p>Fifth factor: What he wants is by his right.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Accomplishing directives without some use of these factors will fall flat for the presidency.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><em>The constitution didn’t separate powers it created a government of shared power</em></p></li>
<li><p>The essence of a President’s persuasive task is to convince such men that what the White House wants of them is what they ought to do for their sake and on authority.</p></li>
<li><p>Fear of presidential action is important in allowing the president to have greater persuasiveness.</p></li>
<li><p>The power to persuade is the power to bargain</p>
<ul>
<li>status and authority help with bargaining.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>President and congress need each other to do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>President still to some degree has to persuade people within the executive office.</p>
<ul>
<li>lower tier department officials.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>logic and reasoning is not enough for persuasion</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reminds me of Socrates vs.&nbsp;the Sophists</p>
<ul>
<li>Plato, in his famous fight against the ancient Sophists, discovered that their “universal art of enchanting the mind by arguments” (Phaedrus 261) had nothing to do with truth but aimed at opinions which by their very nature are changing, and which are valid only “at the time of the agreement and as long as the agreement lasts” (Theaetetus 172). He also discovered the very insecure position of truth in the world, for from “opinions comes persuasion and not from truth” (Phaedrus 260). The most striking difference between ancient and modern sophists is that the ancients were satisfied with a passing victory of the argument at the expense of truth, whereas the moderns want a more lasting victory at the expense of reality. In other words, one destroyed the dignity of human thought whereas the others destroy the dignity of human action. The old manipulators of logic were the concern of the philosopher, whereas the modern manipulators of facts stand in the way of the historian. For history itself is destroyed, and its comprehensibility —based upon the fact that it is enacted by men and therefore can be understood by men—is in danger, whenever facts are no longer held to be part and parcel of the past and present world, and are misused to prove this or that opinion. p.9 Origins of totalitarianism</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“The people on the hill don’t do what they might like to do, they do what they think they have to do in their own interest as they see it.”</p></li>
<li><p>President has to persuade congressmen that what he wants is in the best interest of them.</p></li>
<li><p>president has a lot of soft power - anyone will pick up the phone if he calls.</p></li>
<li><p>President has the ability to grease wheels.</p></li>
<li><p>president power is subtle.</p></li>
<li><p>but of course the president is still powerful.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-focus-1">Main focus:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>“What is critical is the extent to which a court can and does make policy decisions by going outside established”legal” criteria found in precedent, statute, and constitution.”</p></li>
<li><p>Much of the court’s legitimacy rests upon the fiction that it is not a political institution but exclusively a legal one.</p></li>
<li><p>There are cases where the supreme court is deciding between policy and the solution cannot be found in precedent, statute, or the constitution.</p>
<ul>
<li>thus the court is a national policy maker.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This motivates the question: “what groups benefit or are handicapped by the Court and how does the allocation by the Court of these rewards and penalties fit into our presumably democratic political system?</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ii" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ii">II</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The Majority Criterion</p>
<ul>
<li><p>simply majority vs minority.</p></li>
<li><p>every conflict within a given society must be a dispute between a majority of those eligible to participate and a minority or minorities; or else it must be a dispute between or among minorities only.</p></li>
<li><p>Court has three possible outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>accord with the preferences of a minority of citizens and run counter to the preferences of a majority</p></li>
<li><p>accord with the preferences of a majority and run counter to the preferences of a minority</p></li>
<li><p>accord with the preferences of one minority and run counter to the preferences of another minority, the rest being indifferent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This role is not that important or defended much because congress is a thing and represents this all much better.</p></li>
<li><p>But then does the court protect minorities from “tyrannical” majorities?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>well this is also a problematic view according to Dahl</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Democracy is rule by majority. The principle of majority rule is a logical necessity.</p>
<ul>
<li>for the court to act in this way is to affirm that the court <em>ought</em> to act in a way to deny popular sovereingty and political equality ought to prevail in this counry.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How do we even know what the population thinks? What is the majority?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>pre mass polling</p></li>
<li><p>uses congress + president as the barometer of “majority” opinion.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Justices are appointed by presidents - who don’t usually appoint hostile justices!</p>
<ul>
<li>policy views of the court are never far out of line with the lawmaking majorities of the United States (this is obviously a bit outdated as we see differently today).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lawmaking majorities generally have their way.</p></li>
<li><p>The court can delay the application of policy for a long time</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Right of Justice</p>
<ul>
<li><p>basic premise: a country that respects the rights of man or believes in it, the court should defend these rights against a lawmaking majority.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>but the justices are appointed by the lawmaking majority</p>
<ul>
<li><p>are their beliefs ever that far out of line with them?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>do we really think they would go against them?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>doesn’t look that good:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>slave owners over slavery</p></li>
<li><p>white people over black people</p></li>
<li><p>property owners at the expense of wage earners</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the court flagrantly opposes the major policies of the dominant alliance</p>
<ul>
<li>legitimacy goes down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Court is least effective against a current law making majority and least inclined to act.</p></li>
<li><p>Not majority or minority rule but <em>minorities</em> rule.</p></li>
<li><p>the Court operates to confer legitimacy, not simply on the particular and parochial policies of the dominant political alliance, but upon the basic patterns of behavior required for the operation of a democracy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The main objective of presidential leadership is to build a stable and dominant aggregation of minorities with a high probability of winning the presidency and one or both houses of Congress. The main task of the Court is to confer legitimacy on the fundamental policies of the successful coalition.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>this is really important to me!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Big takeaway: court does not have the power to stand against strong majorities.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Frames and stereotypes help inform the public</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Does the public have any choice in news stereotypes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>if they don’t have choice, the public can do little more than follow the elite consensus on what should be done. p.8 (2nd chap)</p>
<ul>
<li>this seems like a supply argument. The more elites -&gt; greater options for the public.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Most attentive members of the public are most likely to adopt elite pov on the matter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>when elites divide, the public tends to split down partisan lines with the elite closest to them.</p></li>

<li><p>Shift in mass attitudes correlates with a shift in elite attitudes.</p></li>
<li><p>Better educated were more likely to adopt elite opinions because they followed them more</p></li>

<li><p>People vary in political awareness</p></li>
<li><p>overall levels of information are low</p></li>
<li><p>Political awareness is associated with increased exposure to current communications that might change one’s opinion, but it is also associated with heightened capacity to react critically to new information.</p>
<ul>
<li>political awareness and mass opinion is the biggest contribution of the book according to Zaller.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>*** Elites are NOT assumed to have an important role in shaping predispositions</strong> ***</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Predispositions mediate people’s responses to elite information in the manner just indicated, but predispositions are not in the short run influenced by elites.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe there is an effect but book doesn’t deal with it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I feel there is lots of overlap with Converse and Campbell in regards to political awareness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>First, one should, whenever possible, use appropriate domain-specific measures of political values, rather than a general measure of ideology, as the operational measure of citizens’ predispositions to accept or reject the political communications they receive. The reason is that ideology, as the more general measure of people’s left-right tendencies, is more likely to miss reactions to a particular issue than is an indicator that has been tailored to that issue.</strong></p></li>

<p>“The interview situation is an odd social experience. The respondent, on his doorstep or in his living room, is barraged with a set of questions on a wide variety of subjects by a stranger, usually a rather well-educated woman over 30, who carefully notes each response on a sheet of paper. Few people are accustomed to having their every utterance faithfully recorded and many find the experience flattering. And, aware that their views are being preserved for the ages, they do not wish to appear unprepared at that moment. Under these circumstances it is not surprising to find respondents pontificating in a seemingly authoritative, if basically”truthful,” manner on subjects about which they know nothing or to which they have never given any thought whatsoever. . . .

<section id="zallers-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="zallers-model">Zaller’s Model:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I abandon the conventional but implausible view that citizens typically possess “true attitudes” on every issue about which a pollster may happen to inquire, and instead propose a model of how individuals construct opinion reports in response to the particular stimuli that confront them.</p>
<ul>
<li>This model unites in one theory an account of how people acquire information about politics, as sketched in the first part of this chapter, with an account of how they use that information to formulate responses to typical survey items.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>People are continuously exposed to a stream of political news and information, much of it valenced so as to push public opinion in one direction or the other. But, owing to the generally low levels of attention to politics in this country, most people on most issues are relatively uncritical about the ideas the internalize. In consequence, they fill up their minds with large stores of only partially consistent ideas, arguments, and considerations. When asked a survey question, they call to mind as many of these ideas as are immediately accessible in memory and use them to make choices among the options offered to them. But they make these choices in great haste - typically on the basis of the one or perhaps two considerations that happen to be at the “top of the head” at the moment of response. p.36 chapter 2</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The basic claim of the model, thus, is that survey responses are a function of immediately accessible “considerations,” where the flow of information in elite discourse determines which considerations are salient. The reason for response instability, on this view, is that different considerations happen to be salient at different times, which causes people’s survey responses to differ over repeated interviews. Changes in question order or question wording can bring about systematic changes in the considerations immediately salient to people, and hence systematic changes in their survey responses.</strong></p></li>

</ol></li>

<section id="summary-of-theoryargument" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-theoryargument">Summary of Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>The authors postulate what they call a theory of affect-driven motivated reasoning in trying to explain when and why citizens actively process biased information. This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being “motivated-skepticals” when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e.&nbsp;spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of “partisan processing” that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:</p>
<p><strong>H1:</strong> there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs</p>
<p><strong>H2:</strong> there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments</p>
<p><strong>H3:</strong> there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones</p>
<p><strong>These combined will results in:</strong></p>
<p><strong>H4:</strong> attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments</p>
<p><strong>Which is conditional upon:</strong></p>
<p><strong>H5:</strong> the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism</p>
<p><strong>H6:</strong> and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.</p>

<li><p>They then viewed information on an information board, where they could seek out hidden policy arguments by known source alone (see figure 2); the amount of time they spend engaging in each argument was recorded by the software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>They viewed eight arguments without a time limit, but could only view each argument ONCE</strong></p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="page-90-issues">Page 90 Issues:</h3>
<p>I really do not like the authors discussions on page 90. Page 90 attempts to provide answers for the following questions posited on page 89: 1) Do environmental forces also influence personality?; 2) is it not the case that people’s personalities change, and does this not imply a role for influences other than biology?; and 3) irrespective of other non biological effects, can political behavior alter and individual’s personality?</p>
<p>In regards to question 1, the authors do support the connection between environmental factors and personality; however, they argue it is only manifested during huge “shocks” in the physical environment to cause this change. They use the example of Chinese students changing personality after moving to Canada. I do not contend that biological factors account for most of the variation in personality, BUT I disagree with the strength they assign the environment on personality.</p>
<p>I believe they are understating the role of environmental factors as their premise lies upon a study of college aged students. A more powerful argument would use young individuals as the subject of focus. But again here lies an issue, the power of environmental factors in shaping personality is more pronounced at a younger age, diminishing over time. Personality like politics is a socialization process. However, we cannot know this because this narrow question requires a counterfactual that simply not possible. To fully evaluate this claim we would need to study an individual from the time they are born to adulthood, raised in different contexts…maybe a twin study could accomplish this?</p>
<p>For question 2, the authors do admit that personality changes over time, especially in their adolescence, but they argue this change does not signify a “noteworthy impact of environmental influences.” Citing Costa and McCrae (1988), the changes are minuscule, further, citing a different article from Costa and McCrae (2006), biological influences account for changes in personality across life cycles. I DO NOT BUY THIS.</p>
<p>“As teenagers mature toward adulthood, they consistently exhibit a tendency to become more agreeable and less neurotic. These tendencies are found in all cultures, and even in other species. Costa and McCrae (2006, 27) note that”the hypothesis of intrinsic maturation is supported indirectly by evidence that similar age trends are found in other primates. Indeed, anyonef amiliar with puppies and old dogs can understand how the human decline in Excitement Seeking might be biologically based.”</p>
<p>While I have not read the aforementioned articles, their measurements are suspect. Age is obviously playing a massive role in this. We know from the political socialization literature that political opinions/ideology is strongly influenced by parents and family at a young age. <strong>Are we not sure personality is part of that socialization process?</strong></p>
<p>I do agree with the statement that political behavior influencing personality is unlikely.</p>
<p>Personality -&gt; certain political behavior</p>
<ul>
<li>okay this is fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personality is rooted in biology, and that effects of political behavior on personality are unlikely.</p>
<p>Do environmental and trait effects operate independently of one another, or in combination?</p>
<p>“Last, we reiterate that because of clear evidence regarding the heritabiltiy of the five-factor trait structure, any findings we report regarding the effects of personality on political behavior will be strongly suggestive of a role for personality as a mechanism linking biology and politics.”</p>

<p>Influential theories depict politicians as, alternatively, strongly constrained by public opinion, able to shape public opinion with persuasive appeals, or relatively unconstrained by public opinion and able to shape it merely by announcing their positions. To test these theories, we conducted unique field experiments in cooperation with sitting politicians in which U.S. state legislators sent constituents official communications with randomly assigned content. The legislators sometimes stated their issue positions in these letters, sometimes supported by extensive arguments but sometimes minimally justified; in many cases, these issue positions were at odds with voters’. An ostensibly unrelated survey found that voters often adopted the positions legislators took, even when legislators offered little justification. Moreover, voters did not evaluate their legislators more negatively when representatives took positions these voters had previously opposed, again regardless of whether legislators provided justifications. The findings are consistent with theories suggesting voters often defer to politicians’ policy judgments.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-6">Abstract</h3>
<p><em>This article uses data from the American National Election Studies and national exit polls to test Fiorina’s assertion that ideological polarization in the American public is a myth. Fiorina argues that twenty-first-century Americans, like the mid twentieth-century Americans described by Converse, “are not very well-informed about politics, do not hold many of their views very strongly, and are not ideological” (2006, 19). However, our evidence indicates that since the 1970s, ideological polarization has increased dramatically among the mass public in the United States as well as among political elites. There are now large differences in outlook between Democrats and Republicans, between red state voters and blue state voters, and between religious voters and secular voters. These divisions are not confined to a small minority of activists—they involve a large segment of the public and the deepest divisions are found among the most interested, informed, and active citizens. Moreover, contrary to Fiorina’s suggestion that polarization turns off voters and depresses turnout, our evidence indicates that polarization energizes the electorate and stimulates political participation.</em></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-7">Abstract:</h3>
<p>The current debate over the extent of polarization in the American mass public focuses on the extent to which partisans’ policy preferences have moved. Whereas “maximalists” claim that partisans’ views on policies have become more extreme over time (Abramowitz 2010), “minimalists” (Fiorina and Abrams 2009) contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occurred reflects sorting, i.e., the increased association between partisanship and ideology. We argue in favor of an alternative definition of polarization, based on the classic concept of social distance (Bogardus 1947). using data from a variety of sources, we demonstrate that both republicans and democrats increasingly dislike, even loathe, their opponents. We also find that partisan affect is inconsistently (and perhaps artifactually) founded in policy attitudes. the more plausible account lies in the nature of political campaigns; exposure to messages attacking the out-group reinforces partisans’ biased views of their opponents.</p>

<li><p>the weak association between ideological and affective polarization is consistent with the vast literature demonstrating that partisan identity in the united States has only weak ideological underpinnings.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-8">Abstract:</h3>
<p>The distinction between a person’s ideological identity and their issue positions has come more clearly into focus in recent research. Scholars have pointed out a significant difference between identity based and issue-based ideology in the American electorate. However, the affective and social effects of these separate elements of ideology have not been sufficiently explored. Drawing on a national sample collected by SSI and data from the 2016 ANES, this article finds that the identity based elements of ideology are capable of driving heightened levels of affective polarization against outgroup ideologues, even at low levels of policy attitude extremity or constraint. These findings demonstrate how Americans can use ideological terms to disparage political opponents without necessarily holding constrained sets of policy attitudes.</p>

<li><p>Author argues Democrats are more pragmatic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Republicans are more ideologically driven.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Democratic Party’s character as a social group coalition fosters a relatively pragmatic, results-oriented style of politics in which officeholders are rewarded for delivering concrete benefits to targeted groups in order to address specific social problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Republicans, in contrast, are more likely to forge partisan ties based on common ideological beliefs, encouraging party officials to pursue broad rightward shifts ni public policy.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result, Republican voters and activists are more likely than their Democratic counterparts to prize symbolic demonstrations of ideological purity and to pressure their party leaders to reject moderation and compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>This dynamic is reflected in the partisan attitudes within the public at large.</p></li>
<li><p>Public is operationally liberal and symbolically conservative.</p></li>
<li><p>Republicans more likely to view their party as standing for abstract values.</p></li>
<li><p>Fun interesting quote from FDR:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Roughly speaking, the liberal school of thought recognizes that the new conditions throughout the world call for new remedies. . (that can be adopted and successfuly maintained in this country under our present form of government if we use government as an instrument of cooperation to provide these remedies…the opposing or conservative school of thought, as a general proposition, does not recognize the need for Government itself to step in and take action to meet these new problems. It believes that individual initiative and private philanthropy will solve them-that we ought to repeal many of the things we have done and go back [to prior policies].”</p>
<ul>
<li>pretty much sums of the left-right dimension.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Republican propensity for ideological thinking is not simply due to religion or education; rather, is is a product of the movement’s successful communication of its version of american political tradition to the party’s electorate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frank Luntz.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong Democratic identifiers consistently describe politics as a competition among social groups for favorable concrete policies and benefits, whereas strong Republicans explain the salient differences between the parties as concerning a more abstract conflict over the proper role of government.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Both hold policy positions but differ in REASONING!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Democrats more closely match social identity</p></li>
<li><p>Republicans more closely match ideological identity as described by Abramowitz &amp; Saunders.</p></li>
<li><p>Republican voters value purists</p></li>
<li><p>Democratic voters value people that compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>David Broockman and Christopher Skovron found that politicians dramatically overestimated the proportion of their constituents who agreed with conservative positions on abolishing welfare programs, implementing universal health coverage, and allowing same-sex marriage.? Though politicians in both parties exhibited this bias, Republicans overestimated conservative issue positions by a much larger margin than did Democrats-usually by more than 20 percent, implying that they viewed the average legislative district as more collectively conservative than the nation’s most conservative districts are in actuality.</strong></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-9">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Are people conservative (liberal) because they are Republicans (Democrats)? Or is it the reverse: people are Republicans (Democrats) because they are conservatives (liberals)? Though much has been said about this long-standing question, it is difficult to test because the concepts are nearly impossible to disentangle in modern America. Ideology and partisanship are highly correlated, only growing more so over time. However, the election of President Trump presents a unique opportunity to disentangle party attachment from ideological commitment. Using a research design that employs actual “conservative” and “liberal” policy statements from President Trump, we find that low-knowledge respondents, strong Republicans, Trump-approving respondents, and self-described conservatives are the most likely to behave like party loyalists by accepting the Trump cue—in either a liberal or conservative direction. These results suggest that there are a large number of party loyalists in the United States, that their claims to being a self-defined conservative are suspect, and that group loyalty is the stronger motivator of opinion than are any ideological principles.</p>

<li><p>partisans emphasize group attachment over issue positions.</p></li>
<li><p>Among Republicans, the politically knowledgeable, those who do not approve of the cue giver, and self-described moderates and liberals are not all that likely to change their views when informed of President Trump’s positions.</p></li>
<li><p>The implication of this unique test is that large, predictable segments of the public—partisans, the less-informed, approvers of the party leader, and even those who claim the most strong symbolic ideological labels—are likely to be influenced more by partisanship than by any issue content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>First, no group reacts to a cue that comes from Republican leaders in Congress.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trump has some extraordinary sway that republican leaders do not have.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Democrats and Independents do not react to Trump cues, but Republicans do</strong></p></li>
<li><p>we find strong support for both the knowledge and the approval hypotheses within the broader population.</p></li>
<li><p>Those least knowledgeable and most approving of Trump are more likely to react to a Trump cue</p></li>
<li><p><strong>However, our results run exactly in the opposite direction of the ideology hypothesis. In fact, it is those most likely to call themselves strong conservatives who are most influenced by the cue, <em>regardless of the direction of the cue.</em> Strong conservatives move the most when faced with a conservative Trump cue <em>and</em> when faced with a liberal Trump cue.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>so their ideological stance is actually a bit shaky it seems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Higher-knowledge individuals are more likely to look like policy loyalists than party loyalists. On the other hand, low-knowledge individuals display the opposite pattern.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-10">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Despite dramatic increases in available political information through cable television and the Internet, political knowledge and turnout have not changed noticeably. To explain this seeming paradox, I argue that greater media choice makes it easier for people to find their preferred content. People who like news take advantage of abundant political information to become more knowledgeable and more likely to turn out. In contrast, people who prefer entertainment abandon the news and become less likely to learn about politics and go to the polls. To test this proposition, I develop a measure of people’s media content preference and include it in a representative opinion survey of 2,358 U.S. residents. Results show that content preference indeed becomes a better predictor of political knowledge and turnout as media choice increases. Cable TV and the Internet increase gaps in knowledge and turnout between people who prefer news and people who prefer entertainment.</p>

<li>The analyses presented here show that both are true. Newmedia do indeed increase political knowledge and involve-ment in the electoral process among some people, just asthe optimists predict. Yet, the evidence supports the pessimists’ scenario as well. Other people take advantage ofgreater choice and tune out of politics completely. Thosewith a preference for entertainment, once they gain accessto new media, become less knowledgeable about politicsand less likely to vote. People’s media content preferencesbecome the key to understanding the political implica-tions of new media</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-11">Abstract:</h3>
<p>The level of journalistic resources dedicated to coverage of local politics is in a long-term decline in the US news media, with readership shifting to national outlets. We investigate whether this trend is demand - or supply-driven, exploiting a recent wave of local television station acquisitions by a conglomerate owner. Using extensive data on local news programming and viewership, we find that the ownership change led to (1) substantial increases in coverage of national politics at the expense of local politics, (2) a significant rightward shift in the ideological slant of coverage, and (3) a small decrease in viewership, all relative to the changes at other news programs airing in the same media markets. These results suggest a substantial supply side role in the trends toward nationalization and polarization of politics news, with negative implications for accountability of local elected officials and mass polarization.</p>

<p>Many Americans consume aligned partisan media, which scholars worry contributes topolarization. Many propose encouraging these Americans to consume cross-cutting media tomoderate their attitudes. However, motivated reasoning theory posits that exposure to cross-cutting media could backfire, exacerbating polarization. Building on theories that sustainedexposure to novel information can overcome motivated reasoning and that partisan sourceson opposite sides cover distinct information, we argue that sustained consumption of cross-cutting media leads voters to learn uncongenial information and moderate their attitudes incovered domains. To test this argument, we used data on actual TV viewership to recruit asample of regular Fox News viewers and incentivized a randomized treatment group to watchCNN instead for a month. Contrary to predictions from motivated reasoning, watching CNNcaused substantial learning and moderated participants’ attitudes in covered domains. We closeby discussing challenges partisan media may pose for democracy.</p>
