<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-good-arguments">Making Good Arguments</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>There are claims and main claims</p>
<ul>
<li><p>claims = any sentence that asserts something that may be true or false and so needs support.</p></li>
<li><p>main claim = the sentence (or more) that your whole report supports (aka thesis).</p></li>
<li><p>reason = a sentence that supporting a claim, main or not.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p>something you and your readers can see, touch, taste, smell, or hear; accepted by everyone - a fact.</p></li>
<li><p>Where could I go to see your evidence?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Core of a research argument:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claim</strong> because of <strong>Reason</strong> based on <strong>Evidence</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We dont accept a claim just because you back it up with <em>your</em> reasonsand <em>your</em> evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p>as a result, readers may question any part of your argument</p></li>
<li><p>Need to imagine readers objections!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Need to justify the connection between the reason and the claim.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is the <strong>WARRANT!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if you think readers won’t immedaitely see how a reason is relevant to your claim, then you justify the connection with a warrant, usually before you make it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The five elements:</p>

<li><p>If the reverse of a claim seems self-evidently false, then most readers are unlikely to consider the original worth an argument.</p></li>
<li><p>If your claim is true…Why should I care?</p></li>

<li><p>The empirical materials of our own work lie within a particular historical setting.</p></li>

<li><p>Contribution (as they outline):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>first is the political impact of identification with social class.</p></li>
<li><p>second is the psychological determinants of voting preference.</p></li>

<li><p>Hypothesis: the partisan choice the individual voter makes depends in an immediate sense on the strength and direction of the elements comprising a field of psychological forces, where these elements are interpreted as attitudes toward the perceived objects of national politics.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-1">Chapter 1:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 1 seems to be justifying why we should study government through a economic rationality and what that entails (assumptions, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Goal: We want to predict behavior! Economic rationality is a tool/lens to help us predict rational and irrational behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>As opposed to government’s impact on private decision making or the share of government in economic aggregates, Downs makes the point that government has not been successfully integrated with private decision-makers in a general equilibrium theory.</p></li>
<li><p>Thesis: Provide a behavior rule for democratic government.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide such a rule by positing that democratic governments act rationally to maximize political support.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is economic rationality?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A rational man is one who behaves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1) always makes a decision</p></li>
<li><p>2) he ranks all alternatives in order of preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>3) preference ranking is transitive</p></li>
<li><p>4) always chooses that which ranks highest in his preference</p></li>
<li><p>5) always makes the same decision each time he is confronted with the same alternatives</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>these assumptions are applied to all the players: political parties, interest groups, and governments.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationality: refers to the process of action, not to their ends or even to their success at reaching desired ends.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Are inefficient men always irrational or can rational men also act inefficiently?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a mistaken rational man at least intends to strike an accurate balance between costs and returns; whereas an irrational man deliberately fails to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>rational man corrects mistake if known and the cost of eliminating it is smaller than the benefits therefrom.</p></li>
<li><p>if a man exhibits political behavior which does not help him attain his political goals efficiently, we feel justified in labeling him politically irrational, no matter how necessary to his psychic adjustments this behavior may be.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="the-structure-of-the-model" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-structure-of-the-model">The Structure of the Model</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Our model is based on the assumption that every government seeks to maximize political support.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>periodic elections are held</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>primary goal is reelection</strong></p></li>
<li><p>the election is the goal of those parties now out of power.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>party that receives the most votes controls the entire government until the next election.</p></li>
<li><p>no intermediate votes</p></li>
<li><p>governing party has unlimited freedom of actions.</p></li>
<li><p>government cannot hamper the operations of other political entities. (or freedoms)</p></li>
<li><p>No economic limits to its power.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>With these assumptions, we can construct a model showing how a rational government behaves in the kind of democratic state we outlined above.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>There is uncertainty in our “world”.</p>
<ul>
<li>uncertainty = imperfect information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“Thus our model could be described as a study of political rationality from an economic point of view. By comparing the picture of rational behavior which emerges from this study with what is known about actual political behavior, the reader should be able to draw some interesting conclusions about the operation of democratic politics.”</strong></p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-relation-of-our-model-to-previous-economic-models-of-government">The Relation of our Model to Previous Economic Models of Government</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>This is kind of the warrant section for the article? Why do we need a new model? What do others do and why are they insufficient?</p></li>
<li><p>Previous models are normative.</p></li>
<li><p>Downs model is positive. - deductive</p></li>
<li><p>Downs discusses previous models, mainly focusing on Buchanan-Samuelson approach</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Samuelson posits two mutually exclusive ways to view decision making by the state:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1) consider the state a separate person with its own ends not necessarily related to the ends of the individuals</p>
<ul>
<li>Downs disagree with this</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2) only individuals as having end structures. The state has no welfare function of its own; it is merely a means by which individuals can satisfy some of their wants collectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Downs thinks this is partly true.</p>
<ul>
<li>the individualistic view is incomplete because it doesn’t take coalitions into consideration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Problem: discovering a relationship between the ends of individuals at large and the ends of the coalition which does not restrict government to providing indivisible benefits. p.17</p></li>
<li><p>Our model attempts to forge a positive relationship between individual and social end structures by means of a political device.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>in our model, government pursues its goal under three considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>a democratic political structure which allows opposition parties to exist</p></li>
<li><p>an atmosphere of varing degrees of uncertainty,,</p></li>
<li><p><strong>and an electorate of rational voters.</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>We wish to discover what form of political behavior is a rational for the government and citizens of a democracy.</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>In order to plan its policies so as to gain votes, the government must discover some relationship between what it does and how citizens vote.</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><p><em>The People’s Choice</em> is focused on the formation, change, and development of public opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li>how do attitudes form?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>the role of turnover in the election. turnover represents opinion/behavior is unstable (if large).</p></li>
<li><p>Lazarsfeld et al.&nbsp;asks some interesting rhetorical questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What types of events show a small or large turnover as they develop?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the turnover tend to become smaller as the events run their course?</p></li>
<li><p>At what point is a minimum turnover reached and what is likely to increase it again?</p></li>
<li><p>Under what conditions do we have a balanced turnover, as in this case, where the changes in various directions seem to cancel each other?</p>
<ul>
<li>all of these kind of remind me of Gelman &amp; King’s article on polls/elections/campaigns.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Turnover is the result of changes which come about in the intentions, expectations, and behavior of individual persons.</p></li>
<li><p>Three questions arise</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What kind of people are likely to shift?</p></li>
<li><p>Under what influences do these shifts come about?</p></li>
<li><p>In what directions are the shifts made?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“In the present study, face-to-face contacts turned out to be the most important influences stimulating opinion change.</p>
<ul>
<li>“The discovery of the conditions under which attitudes or modes of behavior are particularly accessible to personal influence, the classification of types of personal influence most effective in modifying opinion, the examination of situations in which the more formal influences of mass media seem to produce change, all these are typical problems for what we have called dynamic social research.” xxvi</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>xxvi is very interesting overview. Definitely come back here.</p></li>
<li><p>“We thus came to the conclusion that party changes are in the direction of greater consistency and homogeneity within subgroups. p.139”</p></li>
<li><p>Making an argument that in 1944, there was greater democratic machinery in Erie, causing more to side with democrats as opposed to 1940 which saw more side with republicans when their machinery was stronger.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>discussion about cross-pressure, information gathering, social bridging, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>individuals who experienced cross-pressures took considerably longer to arrive at a definite vote decision.</p></li>
<li><p>“In the present study we found that one of the functions of opinion leaders is to mediate between the mass media and other people in their groups. It is commonly assumed that individuals obtain their information directly from newspapers, radio, and other media. Our findings, however, did not bear this out. The majority of people acquired much of their information and many of their ideas through personal contacts with the opinion leaders in their groups. These latter individuals, in turn, exposed themselves relatively more than others to the mass media.</p></li>

<li><p>Why do people decide who to vote for at different times?</p></li>
<li><p>Delayed decision - had less interest in the election</p></li>
<li><p>those who made their choice late - subject to more cross-pressures.</p></li>
<li><p>more interest = the sooner they decide who to vote for.</p>

<li>they were also more likely to express anxiety.</li>

<li><p>this all is very similar to Campbell.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who decide late were also less concerned about the ramifications of the election and who won.</p></li>
<li><p>What cross-pressure will win out? That is which has more influence - religion or socio-economic status?</p></li>

<p>Political knowledge is a central concept in the study of public opinion and political behavior. Yet what the field collectively believes about this construct is based on dozens of studies using different indicators of knowledge. We identify two theoretically relevant dimensions: a temporal dimension that corresponds to the time when a fact was established and a topical dimension that relates to whether the fact is policy-specific or general. The resulting typology yields four types of knowledge questions. In an analysis of more than 300 knowledge items from late in the first decade of the 2000s, we examine whether classic findings regarding the predictors of knowledge withstand differences across types of questions. In the case of education and the mass media, the mechanisms for becoming informed operate differently across question types. However, differences in the levels of knowledge between men and women are robust, reinforcing the importance of including gender-relevant items in knowledge batteries.</p>

<li><p>The present study provides a framework for understanding how the content or type of question affects observed levels of knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Political Knowledge -</strong> Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter’s definition - “The range of factual information about politics that is stored in long-term memory.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does this differ from <strong>political sophistication?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>keep this in mind.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>3 factors:</p>

<li><p>ability</p></li>
<li><p>opportunity</p></li>
<li><p>motivations</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How is a fact learned?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>first factor: how recently the fact came into being</p></li>
<li><p>second factor: the type of fact - whether the question has to do with public policy concerns or the institutions and people/players of government (topical dimension).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>General v. policy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>General - questions ask about the institutions and people/players of government</p>
<ul>
<li>Carpini and Keeter emphasize the importance of general.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Policy-specific - whether the question has to do with public policy concerns</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gilens strong advocate</p>
<ul>
<li>“many people who are fully informed in terms of general political knowledge are nonetheless ignorant of policy-specific information that would alter their political judgments.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>policy specific is more domain-specific than general</p>

<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Opportunity - the amount of news coverage</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>The level of political knowledge increases as information about particular topics becomes more plentiful</p>

<li><p>lots of observations (tens of thousands)</p></li>
<li><p>surveys were augmented with media content data and other controls.</p></li>
<li><p>Depedent Variable: <strong>Knowledge</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pew research and Roper archives for surveys about knowledge in the later half of the 2000s</p></li>
<li><p>questions about public policy, people in office, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Independent Variables: <strong>Question and Environmental level indicators</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each knowledge question was coded for the two question-level characteristics appearing in fig 1. (surveillance vs.&nbsp;static and policy-specific vs.&nbsp;general).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>temporal dimension: when the even occured - when the fact became established.</p>
<ul>
<li>when the person took office. When the bill passed. Last measure of unemployment prior to the question being asked in the survey.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>surveillance facts were treated as those in which the correct answer was established 100 days prior to survey. all other questions were coded as static.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>43% surveillance and 57% static</p></li>
<li><p>Questions haveing to do with institutions of gov or people and players were coded as zero</p>
<ul>
<li>domestic policies, actions by congress, or foreign policy topics = 1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To examine the effect of mass media on knowledge, we characterized the info environment for each topic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the Pew Research News Coverage Index (NCI) project.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>provides a broad snapshot of which stories are being reported in the media at a given time and by who.</p>
<ul>
<li>The media coverage variable is the NCI count of stories concerning a given knowledge question extending six weeks back in time. Thus, for a question asking which office Hillary Clinton holds in the beginning of June 2010, we counted NCI stories having to do with Hillary Clinton from roughly the middle of April until the field date of the survey. The six-week cutoff, though somewhat arbitrary, ensures that potential learning effects of current coverage are not misidentified due to less relevant levels of coverage in the past.</li>

<p>Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin show that well-informed Republicans and conservatives were highly supportive of the 2001 Bush tax cut. They mistakenly infer that this fact invalidates my claim in “Homer Gets a Tax Cut” that “the strong plurality support” for the tax cut was “entirely attributable to simple ignorance.” Their analysis, like mine, implies that a fully-informed public would have been lukewarm, at best, toward the tax cut. They have little to say about why this is the case, beyond insisting that “citizens have reasons for the opinions they have.” I suggest that citizens’ “reasons” are sometimes misleading, misinformed, or substantively irrational, and that social science should not be limited to “attempts to better fit our analyses into their rationales.”</p>

<li><strong>THIS IS THE KEY POINT: “IN THE CASE OF THE BUSH TAX CUT, HOWEVER, UNINFORMED CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL VALUES WERE VERY LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE POLICY-IF THEY TOOK ANY POSITION AT ALL.</strong></li>

<li><p>Much of Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin’s critique focuses on my claim that “the strong plurality support for Bush’s tax cut … is entirely attributable to simple ignorance.”</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Lupia et al.&nbsp;unsubtle effort to, quite literally, change the subject is in service of a broader goal: rationalizing every political thinking and behavior.</strong></p>

<li><p>Bartels agrees we need to understand people’s rational. HOWEVER:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-2">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Numerous studies find associations between social media use and beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation. While such findings are often interpreted as evidence that social media causally promotes conspiracy beliefs, we theorize that this relationship is conditional on other individual-level predispositions. Across two studies, we examine the relationship between beliefs in conspiracy theories and media use, finding that individuals who get their news from social media and use social media frequently express more beliefs in some types of conspiracy theories and misinformation. However, we also find that these relationships are conditional on conspiracy thinking—-the predisposition to interpret salient events as products of conspiracies—-such that social media use becomes more strongly associated with conspiracy beliefs as conspiracy thinking intensifies. This pattern, which we observe across many beliefs from two studies, clarifies the relationship between social media use and beliefs in dubious ideas.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-3">Abstract:</h3>
<p>This article challenges the often untested assumption that cognitive “heuristics” improve the decisionmaking abilities of everyday voters. The potential benefits and costs of five common political heuristics are discussed. A new dynamic processtracing methodology is employed to directly observe the use of these five heuristics by voters in a mock presidential election campaign. We find that cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex. A hypothesized interaction between political sophistication and heuristic use on the quality of decision making is obtained across several different experiments, however. As predicted, heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices. A situation in which experts can be led astray by heuristic use is also illustrated. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for strategies to increase input from under-represented groups into the political process.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-4">Abstract:</h3>
<p>In a recent issue of Perspectives on Politics, Larry Bartels examines the high levels of support for tax cuts signed into law by President Bush in 2001. In so doing, he characterizes the opinions of “ordinary people” as lacking “a moral basis” and as being based on “simple-minded and sometimes misguided considerations of self interest.” He concludes that “the strong plurality support for Bush’s tax cut … is entirely attributable to simple ignorance.”</p>
<p>Our analysis of the same data reveals different results. We show that for a large and politically relevant class of respondents, conservatives and Republicans, rising information levels increase support for the tax cuts. In fact, Republican respondents rated “most informed” supported the tax cuts at extraordinarily high levels (over 96 percent). For these citizens, Bartels’ claim that “better-informed respondents were much more likely to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut” is untrue. Bartels’ results depend on the strong assumption that if more information about the tax cut makes liberals less likely to support it, then conservatives must follow suit. Our analysis allows groups to process information in different ways and can better help political entrepreneurs better reconcile critical social needs with citizens’ desires.</p>

<p>Students of public opinion research have argued that voters show very little consistency and structure in their political attitudes. A model of the survey response is proposed which takes account of the vagueness in opinion survey questions and in response categories. When estimates are made of this vagueness or “measurement error” and the estimates applied to the principal previous study, nearly all the inconsistency is shown to be the result of the vagueness of the questions rather than of any failure by the respondents.</p>

<li><p>“When a voter is stable in his views and all observed variability is measurement error, correlations will be equal across time periods.

<ul>
<li><p>Basically:</p>

<li><p>smaller correlations between periods means genuine changes in belief.</p>
<ul>
<li>time 1 should NOT have more predictive power than time 2 for time 3</li>

<li><p><strong>Primary Thesis: as one moves from elite sources of belief systems downwards on such an information scale, several important things occur:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>1) the contextual grasp of “standard” political belief system fades out very rapidly.</p>
<ul>
<li>constraints decline across the universe of idea-elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2) The character of objects that are central in a belief system undergoes systematic change.</p>

<ul>
<li>“Such observations have impressed even those investigators who are dealing with subject matter rather close to the individual’s immediate world: his family budgeting, what he thinks of people more wealthy than he, his attitudes toward leisure time, work regulations, and the like. But most of the stuff of politics-particularly that played on a national or international stage- is, in the nature of things, remote and abstract. Where politics is concerned, therefore, such ideational changes begin to occur rapidly below the extremely thin stratum of the electorate that ever has occasion to make public pronouncements on political affairs. In other words, the changes in belief systems of which we speak are not a pathology limited to a thin and disoriented bottom layer of the <em>lumpenproletariat;</em> they are immediately relevant in understanding the bulk of mass political behavior.” p.213 towards the bottom.</li>

<p>What share of citizens hold meaningful views about public policy? Despite decades of scholarship, researchers have failed to reach a consensus. Researchers agree that policy opinions in surveys are unstable but disagree about whether that instability is real or just measurement error. In this article, we revisit this debate with a concept neglected in the literature: knowledge of which issue positions “go together” ideologically—or what Philip Converse called knowledge of “what goes with what.” Using surveys spanning decades in the United States and the United Kingdom, we find that individuals hold stable views primarily when they possess this knowledge and agree with their party. These results imply that observed opinion instability arises not primarily from measurement error but from instability in the opinions themselves. We find many US citizens lack knowledge of “what goes with what” and that only about 20%–40% hold stable views on many policy issues.</p>

<li><p>Zaller &amp; Zaller &amp; Feldman argued that opinion instability results from citizens holding conflicting considerations on policy issues and then sampling from these pools of inconsistent considerations when they answer survey questions.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-7">Abstract:</h3>
<p>We examine the accessibility of ideological and partisan orientations as factors affecting the political capacity of citizens. In particular, is the utility of partisan and ideological reasoning contingent on the accessibility of an individual’s own self-identifications? Are people with accessible points of ideological and partisan orientation more likely to in voke these orientations in formulating political judgments and resisting efforts at political persuasion? Are they more likely to demonstrate politically compatible points of orientation? These questions are addressed in the context of a study conducted during the course of the 1996 election campaign. In order to measure the accessibility of respondents’ partisan and ideological self-identifications, we record response latencies-the time re quired for respondents to answer particular questions. Based on our analysis, we argue that attitudes and self identifications are useful heuristic devices that allow individuals to make sense out of the complexity and chaos of politics. But some citizens are better able than others to employ these devices, and by demonstrating who these citizens are, the concept of accessibility becomes an important element in the explanation of political capacity.</p>

<p>The average voter falls far short of the prescriptions of classic democratic theory in terms of interest, knowledge, and participation in politics. We suggest a more realistic standard: Citizens fulfill their democratic duties if most of the time, they vote “correctly.” Relying on an operationalization of correct voting based on fully informed interests, we present experimental data showing that, most of the time, people do indeed manage to vote correctly. We also show that voters’ determinations of their correct vote choices can be predicted reasonably well with widely available survey data. We illustrate how this measure can be used to determine the proportion of the electorate voting correctly, which we calculate at about 75% for the five American presidential elections between 1972 and 1988. With a standard for correct vote decisions, political science can turn to exploring the factors that make it more likely that people will vote correctly.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-9">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Opinion research is beset by two major types of “artifactual” variance: huge amounts of overtime response instability and the common tendency for seemingly trivial changes in questionnaire form to affect the expression of attitudes. We propose a simple model that converts this anomalous “error variance” into sources of substantive insight into the nature of public opinion. The model abandons the conventional but implausible notion that most people possess opinions at the level of specificity of typical survey items-and instead assumes that most people are internally conflicted over most political issues-and that most respond to survey questions on the basis of whatever ideas are at the top of their heads at the moment of answering. Numerous empirical regularities are shown to be consistent with these assumptions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most citizens, we argue, simply do not possess preformed attitudes at the level of specificity demanded in surveys.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They carry around in their heads a mix of only partially consistent ideas and considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>when questioned, they call to mind a sample of these ideas, including an oversample of ideas made salient by the questionnaire and the other recent events, and use them to choose among the options offered .

</ul></li>
<li><p>The heart of our argument is that for most people, most of the time, there is no need to reconcile or even to recognize their contradictory reactions to events and issues.</p>

<li><p>We should find that people are, in general, more politically involved have more considerations at the top of their heads and available for use in answering survey questions.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li>dont have good data for this but have some</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We should find strong correlations between measures of people’s thoughts as they answer a survey item and the direction of decision on the item itself.</p></li>
<li><p>If as the model claims, individuals possess competing considerations on most issues, and if they answer on the basis of whatever ideas happen to be at the top of their minds at the moment of response, one would expect a fair amount of over-time instability in people’s attitude reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Citizens would have central tendencies that are stable over time, but their attitude statements would fluctuate greatly around these central tendencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Attitude reports formed from an average of many considerations will be more reliable indicator of the underlying population of considerations than an average based on just on one or two considerations</p></li>
<li><p>People should be more stable in their responses to close-ended policy items conserning doorstep issues-that is, issues so close to everyday concerns that most people routinely give some thought to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Greater ambivalence ought to be associated with higher levels of response instability.</p></li>
<li><p>If, as the model claims, people are normally ambivalent on issues but answer on the basis of whatever ideas are most accessible at the moment of answering, raising new considerations in immediate proximity to a question should be able to affect the answers given by making different considerations salient.</p></li>
<li><p>Most ambivalent - are the people that should be most strongly affected by artificial changes in question order.</p></li>
<li><p>The tendency of people to base attitude reports on the ideas that are most immediately salient to them, as specified in Axioms 2 and 3, well explains such effects.</p></li>

<li><p>priming effects of television news</p></li>
<li><p>framing effects of question wording and question order</p></li>
<li><p>Having had their ideological orientations made salient to them just prior to answering policy items, those respondents who possess such orientations are more likely to rely on them as a considerations in formulating responses to subsequent policy questions, thereby making those responses more strongly correlated with their ideological positions and hence also more ideologically consistent with one another.</p></li>
<li><p>We therefor expected that responses following the stop-and-think treatment would be, all else equal, more reliable indicators of the set of underlying considerations than responses made in the standard way, that is, in the retrospective condition.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-10">Abstract:</h3>
<p>The study of citizens’ trust in the national government has been primarily individual-level, cross-sectional analysis. In the cur rent research, we develop a quarterly time series measure of trust in the U.S. national government from 1980 to 1997 and conduct the first multivariate time series examination of public trust in government. We find that negative perceptions of the economy, scandals associated with Congress, and increasing public concern about crime each lead to de clining public trust in government. Declining trust in government in turn leads to less positive evaluations of Congress and reduced support for government action to address a range of domestic policy concerns. These results provide new evidence of the influence of public concern about crime and the centrality of Congress in understanding public evaluations of the national government and new evidence of how de clining levels of trust in government may influence elections and do mestic policy making.</p>

<p>I demonstrate that the intolerance of ordinary citizens matter for real politics even if strong linkages to policy outputs do not exist. In particular, the model I test posits that cultural intolerance constrains the liberty of individual citizens. Focusing on how people perceive political freedom, several hypotheses coupling tolerance and freedom are explored. Data from a national survey show that toderance and freedom are connected. Those who do not feel free to express themselves politically are more likely to be intolerant of others, to have less heterogenous peer groups and less tolerant spouses, and to live in less tolerant communities. Ultimately, the importance of mass political intolerance in the United States is that it establishes a culture of conformity that seems to constrain individual political liberty in many important ways.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-12">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Faced with a choice between John McCain and Barack Obama, voters in 2008 were swayed by the familiar play of factors—party identification, policy preferences, and economic conditions—but also, we find, by ethnocentrism, a deep-seated psychological predisposition that partitions the world into ingroups and outgroups—into “us” and “them.” The effect of ethnocentrism was significant and substantial, and it appeared over and above the effects due to partisanship, economic conditions, policy stances, political engagement, and several varieties of conservatism. Two features of Obama were primarily responsible for triggering ethnocentrism in 2008: his race and his imagined Muslim faith. As such, we demonstrate that ethnocentrism was much more important in 2008 than in the four presidential elections immediately preceding 2008, and we show that it was much more important in the actual contest between Senator McCain and Senator Obama than in a hypothetical contest between Senator McCain and Senator Clinton.</p>

<p>Using a measure designed to capture intolerance on both sides of the political spectrum, I find that opinions favoring the abridgement of free speech rights are overwhelmingly targeted at right-leaning groups, and racist groups in particular. Consistent with recent studies, Democrats are found to be less tolerant than Republicans of speech they dislike. However, contrary to existing findings, the same patterns of intolerance are present for both racist and nonracist target groups. Treating racist groups as an exception to the principle of free expression may have resulted in a spillover to intolerance of other disliked groups.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-14">Abstract:</h3>
<p>People are more tolerant when they encounter political disagreement in their social networks. However, research supporting this claim predates concerns over polarization and democratic backsliding—it does not consider partisan tolerance and focuses on interactions with close friends and family (core networks). We develop theory linking acquaintance networks to tolerance, and evaluate it using Cooperative Election Study modules. We contribute by: 1) measuring partisan tolerance, 2) assessing the relationship between partisan tolerance and the presence of (co-)opposing partisans in acquaintance networks, 3) comparing acquaintance and core network approaches, and 4) examining tolerance relationships under important conditions. We find that exposure to outpartisans predicts affirming the civil liberties of outpartisans. Notably, acquaintance results mirror established findings based on core networks, and relationships hold when individuals dislike or feel threatened by outpartisans. Our results suggest that cross-partisan exposure need not be intimate or extended to be democratically meaningful.</p>

<li><p>While name generators regularly underestimate the size of individuals’ core networks, a more serious issue is that by design they also miss people’s casual exposures to political difference; they do not capture the contacts that might be “less relationally close and less frequent discussion partners”</p>

<ul>
<li><p>With respect to more affective components, intimate relationships across lines of political difference—like those found in the “strong ties” of core networks—may help individuals develop affinity for members of outgroups, thereby leading to increased tolerance of said outgroups.</p></li>
<li><p>the idea is that interpersonal interactions across lines of difference can help individuals develop an awareness, understanding, and acknowledgment of societal group differences in opinion</p></li>

<p>Old-fashioned racism (OFR) was unrelated to white Americans’ partisan preferences throughout the post-civil rights era. This study argues OFR could return to white partisanship following decades of dormancy because of Obama’s presidency. After first demonstrating that such attitudes were significantly stronger predictors of opposition to Obama than ideologically similar white Democrats, I support that spillover hypothesis with the following evidence: opposition to interracial dating was correlated with white partisanship in 2009 despite being unrelated to party identification in 12 earlier surveys; moreover, evaluations of Obama completely mediated that relationship between OFR and partisanship; old-fashioned racism predicted changes in white panelists’ partisanship between 2006 and 2011; these attitudes were also a stronger determinant of midterm vote preferences in 2010 than they were in 2006, with that relationship once again mediated by President Obama; and experimentally connecting Obama to congressional candidates significantly increased the relationship between OFR and 2010 preferences.</p>

<p>Mass media convey deep divisions among citizens despite scant evidence for such ideological polarization. Do ordinary citizens perceive themselves to be more extreme and divided than they actually are? If so, what are the ramiﬁcations of such misperception? A representative sample from California provides evidence that voters from both sides of the state’s political divide perceive both their liberal and conservative peers’ positions as more extreme than they actually are, implying inaccurate beliefs about polarization. A second study again demonstrates this ﬁnding with an online sample and presents evidence that misperception of mass-level extremity can affect individuals’ own policy opinions. Experimental participants randomly assigned to learn the actual average policy-related predispositions of liberal and conservative Americans later report opinions that are 8–13% more moderate, on average. Thus, citizens appear to consider peers’ positions within public debate when forming their own opinions and adopt slightly more extreme positions as a consequence.</p>

<li>Is sorting and polarization the same thing? dumb question.</li>
<li>Motivated thought:
<ul>
<li>no one is really digging into the variance between education/types of people and ideology. I think the masses (lower stratum) are not any more ideological but they have sorted. They know the brand they associate with at an abstract level. What is going on then is the elites and upper stratum of the masses have grown more idealistic and polarized. The masses are simply just not paying attention to the policies of the parties per say (zaller), but they follow the cues given to them by the increasingly more polarized elites. They are polarized on attitudes but have sorted into the parties and now just follow the party as an abstract identity irrespective of the beliefs (to some degree) the party is supplying.
<ul>
<li>seems like the authors might disagree? “It maybe be that this polarization is driven by a small segment of the public, while the rest remain more neutral independents. However, the evidence suggests that this is not the case. For example, according to the NES, the number of pure indepenedents among voters in the 2004 presidential eleciton was close to twice as many as in the 1952 election.”

<p><em>The American electorate today is different from that described in</em> The American Voter. <em>Both the 1950s era of ideologically innocent party voting and the subsequent period of partisan dealignment are over. Some political scientists began to describe the New American Voter as a new partisan evolution occurred. What has not been fully appreciated in the twentieth/twenty-first century history of voting studies is how partisanship returned in a form more ideological and more issue based along liberal-conservative lines than it has been in more than 30 years. This is visible in the strength of partisan voting, in the relationship between partisanship and ideology, and in the strength of the relationship of partisanship and self-reported liberal-conservative ideology to the public’s economic, social, racial, and religious attitudes and opinions. Not only has the public responded in a striking way to changes in politics and its context, but the current transformation has also appeared to be strikingly enduring and difficult to shake, based on survey evidence for this new partisan voter.</em></p>

<li><p>We agree that states are a poor unit of analysis when studying political polarization and that a great many Americans take positions in the ideological center.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-1-introduction">Chapter 1: Introduction:</h3>
<p>Main Question: Is partisanship stable? rather, Under what conditions is partisanship stable?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“What makes partisanship interesting, and what was not apparent to researchers until the 1950s, is the fact that voters who call themselves Republicans at age thirty-two will most likely continue to do so at age eighty-two.”</p>
<ul>
<li>this persistence in party id is interesting because we don’t typically conceive of political party as a core social identity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What are the predictors of who you vote for?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>partisanship is obvious but this wasn’t always the case! Different identities have been powerful predictors</p>
<ul>
<li>race especially!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>candidate centered elections.</p>
<ul>
<li>institutions have grown suspect.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Political Science Broadly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>thinks about partisan identities as to how they are shaped by rational evaluations of party platforms and performance in office.</p>
<ul>
<li>Downs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Fiorina argues partisanship constitutes a “running tally” of performance evaluations</p>
<ul>
<li>ehhhh</li>

<section id="argument" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="argument">Argument:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Social-psychological perspective of partisanship</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Partisan attachments form relatively early in adulthood</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a critical understudy of youth’s politicization and their ENGAGEMENT in political discourse.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When people feel a sense of belonging to a given social group, they absorb the doctrinal positions that the group advocates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Our thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>partisan identities reflect a blend of cognition and affect.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People know who they are and where they fit in the matrix of prominent social groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Citizens’ group attachments shape the way that they evaluate political candidates and the policies they espouse.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These evaluations change as new information becomes available, but seldom does the political environment change in ways that alter how people think of themselves or their relationship to significant social groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For this reason, voters’ attachments may remain firm even as their voting preferences shift.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, the basic structure of electoral competition remains intact even as the personae and policies that dominate politics change.</li>

<li><p>Party identification is similar to religion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an identifiable social group.</p></li>
<li><p>this is kinda scary given how religion is pretty enduring.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why do changing political and economic circumstances not have a bigger effect on party attachments?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Campbell argues partisans ignore or deflect information that is inconsistent with their party attachments</p>
<ul>
<li>good support for this in the lit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Public is also inattentive to politics - Campbell.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>We disagree about how partisans attend to and retain information about party performance. Like those scholars who emphasize the rational underpinnings of public opinion, we are skeptical of the notion that partisans ignore or reinterpret discrodant information.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We find that although citizens often lack specific information about day-to-day political events, they do update their overall assessments of national conditions and the capacities of the parties to handle important problems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>People may assimilate new information about the parties and change their perceptions of the parties without changing the team for which they cheer.</strong></p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-18">Abstract:</h3>
<p>the current debate over the extent of polarization in the American mass public focuses on the extent to which partisans’ policy preferences have moved. Whereas “maximalists” claim that partisans’ views on policies have become more extreme over time (Abramowitz 2010), “minimalists” (Fiorina and Abrams 2009) contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occurred reflects sorting, i.e., the increased association between partisanship and ideology. We argue in favor of an alternative definition of polarization, based on the classic concept of social distance (Bogardus 1947). using data from a variety of sources, we demonstrate that both republicans and democrats increasingly dislike, even loathe, their opponents. We also find that partisan affect is inconsistently (and perhaps artifactually) founded in policy attitudes. the more plausible account lies in the nature of political campaigns; exposure to messages attacking the out-group reinforces partisans’ biased views of their opponents</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-19">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Party identification is known to influence almost all aspects of political life. How this attachment develops across the adult life cycle, however, remains unknown. I argue that people reinforce their partisan predispositions by voting for their preferred party. Voting entails a choice over a set of alternatives. This choice is likely to induce rationalization. In so doing, it provides signals of group identity, which in turn strengthens people’s partisan ties. Testing this hypothesis is made difficult because it implies a reciprocal relationship between partisanship and vote choice. I address this problem by using vote eligibility as an instrument of vote in a sample of almost equally aged respondents. The results indicate that elections fortify prior partisan orientations. Moreover, they do so not by increasing political information. Rather, it is the act of voting for a party that, itself, bolsters partisan attachment. This act leaves a long-lasting imprint on people’s partisan outlooks.</p>

<p>Drawing on the sizable literature on polarization in the American public, we consider the link between discussion network composition and <em>perceptions</em> of polarization. Participants in the 2008–2009 ANES panel study were asked to complete an innovative battery; they interactively moved histograms to rate other groups’ positions on several prominent issues. These novel exercises provide data on individuals’ projections of the average attitudes of others, but critically, they also provide data on the variability of such attitudes. Thus, we use these “response-distributions” to thoroughly assess (1) the relationship between network characteristics and perceptions of the distance between party opinions, and (2) the relationship between network characteristics and perceptions of the homogeneity of opinions within parties. We find evidence that discussion networks track with individual perceptions of the parties in the electorate: exposure to interpersonal disagreement predicts the perception of less distance between (the mean opinions of) the parties, and the reporting of more heterogeneity of opinion within the parties. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for democratic functioning more generally.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many scholars cede that regardless of whether opinions of Democrats and Republicans are actually drifting apart, Americans tend to <em>think</em> they are drifting apart</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perceptions of polarization are important in their own right. If citizens view members of the out-party as more ideologically extreme or homogenous than they are, a host of democratic negatives may follow: people may be less likely to engage in disagreeable discussion in order to avoid conflict (that may not actually exist), and may falsely dismiss contrary perspectives as radical/extreme—in other words, the beneficial effects of discourse across lines of difference may be precluded (see, e.g., Mutz <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-017-9387-7#ref-CR35" title="Mutz, D. C. (2006). Hearing the other side: Deliberative versus participatory democracy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.">2006</a>).</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Taken together, the fact that elites are polarized, but that the views of the average citizen are potentially more nuanced (and differ based on affect vs.&nbsp;issue positions) raises questions: How do people perceive distributions of issue attitudes?</p></li>
<li><p>We focus on how social networks structure such evaluations to move beyond standard assessments of how individual attitudes drive perceptions (i.e., simple projection—Judd et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-017-9387-7#ref-CR26" title="Judd, C.

<li><p><strong>Exposure to disagreement serves to reduce differences between the two parties in the electorate; discussing politics with those who hold different beliefs affects perceptions of polarization by encouraging individuals to see less distance between the average opinions in the parties, but also more heterogeneity of opinion within them.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finally, some have argued that a different kind of selection is now at work—that Americans are exposed to dissonant perspectives less and less frequently in day to day life as our society becomes more spatially polarized (e.g., Bishop <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-017-9387-7#ref-CR400" title="Bishop, B. (2008). The big sort: Why the clustering of like-minded America is tearing us apart. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.">2008</a>); this has been pinned to increasing ideological polarization (as people are not afforded the opportunity to understand out-party views). We are not able to weigh in on the sorting debate, and we do not examine the extent to which exposure to disagreement influences actual opinion polarization (we limit our focus to perceptions). However, as our results suggest that exposure to political difference may reduce perceptions of polarization, we would again emphasize a cautiously optimistic tone. Even if people are moving to more politically homogeneous areas, since individuals are often unable to avoid all interpersonal disagreement, there may be reason to suspect that networks could help remedy some of the more deleterious consequences of geographic polarization. We encourage scholars to conduct additional research on the social roots of polarization perceptions so that more definitive conclusions can be reached, and more certain assessments given to this aspect of democratic health.</strong></p></li>

<p>Voting choices are a product of both personal attitudes and social contexts, of a personal and a social calculus. Research has illuminated the personal calculus of voting, but the social calculus has received little attention since the 1940s. This study expands our understanding of the social influences on individual choice by examining the relationship of partisan biases in media, organizational, and interpersonal intermediaries to the voting choices of Americans. Its results show that the traditional sources of social influence still dominate: Interpersonal discussion outweighs the media in affecting the vote. Media effects appear to be the product of newspaper editorial pages rather than television or newspaper reporting, which contain so little perceptible bias that they often are misperceived as hostile. Parties and secondary organizations also are influential, but only for less interested voters—who are more affected by social contexts in general. Overall, this study demonstrates that democratic citizens are embedded in social contexts that join with personal traits in shaping their voting decisions.</p>

<p>The primary sources of these cues are personal networks and groups, not the modern mass media, which has often been ceded greater electoral significance. Second, these partisan cues have a direct influence on voting behavior. To be sure, personal characteristics are key factors in voting: partisanship, ideologies, and fixed personal characteristics play powerful roles in determining the vote. Our evidence indicates, however, that these personal forces are only part of the voting calculus.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-22">Abstract:</h3>
<p>For too long, research on retrospective voting has fixated on how economic trends affect incumbents’ electoral prospects in national and state elections. Hundreds of thousands of elections in the United States occur at the local level and have little to do with unemployment or inflation rates. This paper focuses on the most prevalent: school boards. Specifically, it examines whether voters hold school board members accountable for the performance of their schools. The 2000 elections reveal considerable evidence that voters evaluate school board members on the basis of student learning trends. During the 2002 and 2004 school board elections, however, when media (and by extension public) attention to testing and accountability systems drifted, measures of achievement did not influence incumbents’ electoral fortunes. These findings, we suggest, raise important questions about both the scope conditions of retrospective voting models and the information voters rely upon when evaluating incumbents.</p>

<p>This article describes how far the literature of campaign effects on vote choice has come, and where it should go. It seems clear that the effects of campaigns are more constrained than often is presented in the media. Moreover, the state of research regarding theinfluence of campaigns on vote choice (rather than turnout), including campaign effects due to citizen learning, campaign priming, and, more directly, voter persuasion, is discussed. The recent evidence of campaign effects largely reflects the availability of better data and more sophisticated research designs. In addition to individual-levelvariation in the way voters process campaign information, there is also variation in theparticular campaign messages they receive. The great variation in candidate strategy and voter decision making should be viewed as both an opportunity and challenge for campaign scholars.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-25">Abstract:</h3>
<p>In this commentary, we embed the volume’s contributions on public beliefs about science in a broader theoretical discussion of motivated political reasoning. The studies presented in the preceding section of the volume consistently find evidence for hyperskepticism toward scientific evidence among ideologues, no matter the domain or context—and this skepticism seems to be stronger among conservatives than liberals. Here, we show that these patterns can be understood as part of a general tendency among individuals to defend their prior attitudes and actively challenge attitudinally incongruent arguments, a tendency that appears to be evident among liberals and conservatives alike. We integrate the empirical results reported in this volume into a broader theoretical discussion of the John Q. Public model of information processing and motivated reasoning, which posits that both affective and cognitive reactions to events are triggered unconsciously. We find that the work in this volume is largely consistent with our theories of affect-driven motivated reasoning and biased attitude formation.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="putting-affect-first-motivated-reasoning-and-the-john-q.-public-model">Putting Affect First: Motivated Reasoning and the John Q. Public Model:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Individuals do not accept and internalize informational and contextual frames irrespective of their predispositions.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>John Q. Public model claims that these biases, and information processing in general, are driven by initial affect.</p>
<ul>
<li>the fundamental assumption driving our model is that both affective and cognitive reactions to external and internal events are triggered unconsciously, followed spontaenously by the activation of associateive pathways that link thoughts to feelings to intentions to behavior, so that very early events, even those that occur below conscious awareness, set the direction for all subsequent processing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>all thinking is suffused with feeling and these feelings arise automatically within a few milliseconds of exposure to a sociopolitical object or event.</p></li>
<li><p>spreading activation hypothesis</p>
<ul>
<li>activation from priors and incidental affect will spread along well-traveled “hot” associative pathways that link things together.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>evidence is accumulating that attitudes and behavior arise from automatic, uncontrolled processes and are often set before we begin seriously “thinking” about them. If this is the case, deliberation serves to rationalize rather than cause our thinking, reasoning, and intentions.</p></li>
<li><p>deliberation is a product of unconsciously determined, affectively driven processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How can the model described above account for the empirical findings on science denial?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>hot cognition hypothesis: JQP posits that all social objects and concepts for which prior attitudes exist are affectively charged. Initial affective responses to a stimulus enter the decision stream before any and all conscious deliberations and thereby influence all down-streaming processes, such as the activation of certain considerations in memory, or related judgements and evaluations.</p>
<ul>
<li>how does that affect form? is it elite driven? Experience driven? Do we care? The affect arises if it is familiar or triggers those “hot pathways”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>global warming and climate change have greater affective charge for republicans than democrats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>However, the model presented in this commentary does not claim that individuals never revise their initial attitudes or are unable to overcome their initial affects, but JQP does suggest that persuasion is difficult and certainly more effortful than following the powerful affective currents down the stream of processing.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>overcoming this is difficult and as long as political elites align the debates along partisan lines rather than emphasizing the necessity of a common understand of the underlying issues.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-26">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Misinformation occurs when people hold incorrect factual beliefs and do so confidently. The problem, first conceptualized by Kuklinski and colleagues in 2000, plagues political systems and is exceedingly difficult to correct. In this review, we assess the empirical literature on political misinformation in the United States and consider what scholars have learned since the publication of that early study. We conclude that research on this topic has developed unevenly. Over time, scholars have elaborated on the psychological origins of political misinformation, and this work has cumulated in a productive way. By contrast, although there is an extensive body of research on how to correct misinformation, this literature is less coherent in its recommendations. Finally, a nascent line of research asks whether people’s reports of their factual beliefs are genuine or are instead a form of partisan cheerleading. Overall, scholarly research on political misinformation illustrates the many challenges inherent in representative democracy.</p>

<section id="abstract-27" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-27">Abstract:</h3>
<p>A sizable literature tracing back to Richard Hofstadter’s <em>The Paranoid Style</em> (1964) argues that Republicans and conservatives are more likely to believe conspiracy theories than Democrats and liberals. However, the evidence for this proposition is mixed. Since conspiracy theory beliefs are associated with dangerous orientations and behaviors, it is imperative that social scientists better understand the connection between conspiracy theories and political orientations. Employing 20 surveys of Americans from 2012 to 2021 (total n = 37,776), as well as surveys of 20 additional countries spanning six continents (total n = 26,416), we undertake an expansive investigation of the asymmetry thesis. First, we examine the relationship between beliefs in 52 conspiracy theories and both partisanship and ideology in the U.S.; this analysis is buttressed by an examination of beliefs in 11 conspiracy theories across 20 more countries. In our second test, we hold constant the content of the conspiracy theories investigated—manipulating only the partisanship of the theorized villains—to decipher whether those on the left or right are more likely to accuse political out-groups of conspiring. Finally, we inspect correlations between political orientations and the general predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories over the span of a decade. In no instance do we observe systematic evidence of a political asymmetry. Instead, the strength and direction of the relationship between political orientations and conspiricism is dependent on the characteristics of the specific conspiracy beliefs employed by researchers and the socio-political context in which those ideas are considered.</p>

<li><p>Something to note: there is a large qualitative difference across conspiracies. The conspiracies that republicans may believe in are not necessarilly or should be compared at the same level as democrat conspiracy theories.</p></li>
<li><p>A conspiracy theory is an explanation of an event or circumstnace that accueses powerful actors of working in secret for their own benefit, against the common good, and in a way that undermiens bedrock societal norms, rules, or laws.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>belief in conspiracy theories are often a reaction to elite political discourse.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Given that elite cues and motivated reasoning appear to similarly affect both Republicans/conservatives and Democrats/liberals</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The last five years have witnessed Republican elites in government and media (most notably Donald Trump) utilizing conspiracy theories in a way unprecedented in the last half century of American politics, and with severe, deleterious consequences for democratic institutions. This alone has encouraged renewed conjecture about an asymmetry in conspiracy theory beliefs. However, elites are an imperfect reflection of the public—-they have different goals, incentives, and knowledge about politics. Moreover, elite rhetoric rarely <em>changes</em> predispositions, such as conspiracy thinking, so much as it <em>activates</em> predispositions and <em>connects</em> them to salient political choices (Leeper &amp; Slothuus, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9307120/#CR36">2014</a>). In other words, while Republican elites may have recently activated conspiratorial predispositions among supporters in the mass public—-where they exist—-in a way that Democratic elites did not, they are unlikely to be able to cause once non-conspiratorial supporters to become highly conspiratorial.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We encourage future work to integrate the conspiratorial rhetoric of elites with studies of mass beliefs and investigate elite conspiratorial rhetoric from actors including and beyond Donald Trump.</p></li>

<p>State governments have experimented with a variety of election laws to make voting more convenient and increase turnout. The impacts of these reforms vary in surprising ways, providing insight into the mechanisms by which states can encourage or reduce turnout. Our theory focuses on mobilization and distinguishes between the direct and indirect effects of election laws. We conduct both aggregate and individual-level statistical analyses of voter turnout in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections. The results show that Election Day registration has a consistently positive effect on turnout, whereas the most popular reform-early voting-is actually associated with lower turnout when it is implemented by itself We propose that early voting has created negative unanticipated consequences by reducing the civic significance of elections for individuals and altering the incentives for political campaigns to invest in mobilization.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-29">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Scholars have recently reworked the traditional calculus of voting model by adding a term for benefits to others. Although the probability that a single vote affects the outcome of an election is quite small, the number of people who enjoy the benefit when the preferred alternative wins is large. As a result, people who care about benefits to others and who think one of the alternatives makes others better off are more likely to vote. I test the altruism theory of voting in the laboratory by using allocations in a dictator game to reveal the degree to which each subject is concerned about the well-being of others. The main findings suggest that variation in concern for the well-being of others in conjunction with strength of party identification is a significant factor in individual turnout decisions in real world elections. Partisan altruists are much more likely to vote than their nonpartisan or egoist peers.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-30">Abstract:</h3>
<p>The decision to vote has puzzled scholars for decades. Theoretical models predict little or no variation in participation in large population elections and empirical models have typically accounted for only a relatively small portion of individual-level variance in turnout behavior. However, these models have not considered the hypothesis that part of the variation in voting behavior can be attributed to genetic effects. Matching public voter turnout records in Los Angeles to a twin registry, we study the heritability of political behavior in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The results show that a significant proportion of the variation in voting turnout can be accounted for by genes. We also replicate these results with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and show that they extend to a broad class of acts of political participation. These are the first findings to suggest that humans exhibit genetic variation in their tendency to participate in political activities.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-31">Abstract:</h3>
<p>This paper reframes our inquiry into voter turnout by making aging the lens through which the traditional resource and cost measures of previous turnout research are viewed, thereby making three related contributions. (1) I offer a developmental theory of turnout. This framework follows from the observation that most citizens are habitual voters or habitual nonvoters (they display inertia). Most young citizens start their political lives as habitual nonvoters but they vary in how long it takes to develop into habitual voters. With this transition at the core of the framework, previous findings concerning costs and resources can easily be integrated into developmental theory. (2) I make a methodological contribution by applying latent growth curve models to panel data. (3) Finally, the empirical analyses provide the developmental theory with strong support and also provide a better understanding of the roles of aging, parenthood, partisanship, and geographic mobility.</p>

Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users\' friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between \'close friends\' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks.</code></pre>

<p>Much of the US public acquires political information socially. However, the consequences of acquiring information from others instead of the media are under-explored. I conduct a "telephone-game" experiment to examine how information changes as it flows from official reports to news outlets to other people, finding that social information is empirically different from news articles. In a second experiment on a nationally representative sample, I randomly assign participants to read a news article or a social message about that article generated in Study 1. Participants exposed to social information learned significantly less than participants who were exposed to the news article. However, individuals exposed to information from someone who is like-minded and knowledgeable learned the same objective facts as those who received information from the media. Although participants learned the same factual information from these ideal informants as they did from the media, they had different subjective evaluations.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-34">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Theory: A theory of political communication is employed which stresses the importance of citizen discussion beyond the boundaries of cohesive groups for the dissemination of public opinion.</p>
<p>Hypotheses: If the social communication of political information is bounded by cohesive social groups and strong social ties, we should expect the social flow of political information to be independent from opinion distributions in the larger environment. In contrast, when social communication extends beyond socially cohesive groups, the flow of information should reflect these opinion distributions.</p>
<p>Methods: We analyze a 1992 election survey which includes a battery of questions regarding the construction of respondents’ social networks. The analysis is undertaken with respect to opinion distributions in the larger environments (counties) where the respondents reside.</p>
<p>Results: Individuals are differentially exposed to larger environments of opinion depending on micro environmental patterns of social interaction and political communication. Hence, the construction of a citizen’s social network serves as a filter on the macro environmental flow of political information. In this way, the consequences of the larger environment of opinion depend on the existence of micro environments which expose citizens to surrounding opinion distributions.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background-14">Background:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>“Neither individual preference nor the environment is solely determinate, and thus the information that citizens ultimately obtain through social channels of communication is contingent on the particular intersection between the individual and the environment. The nature of this intersection, in turn, depends on the construction of the citizen’s social network-a micro environmental filter that might expose individuals to, or seclude them from, these larger environments of information.”</p>
<ul>
<li>the supply of information sources varies across environments in systematic ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Implicit assumption in political science is that social influence is highest in closed social cells.</p></li>
<li><p>intimacy becomes a precondition for influence.</p></li>
<li><p>Authors don’t disagree with the role of close ties/intimacy in network but argue there is room for more.</p></li>
<li><p>Huckfeldt and Sprague (1991, 1995) show that South Bend residents engage in discussions of the campaign with others who are less than intimiate x associates.</p></li>
<li><p>When social communication occurs through weak ties, beyond the boundaries of cohesive groups, public opinion becomes more fully public.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual exposure to particular viewpoints is subject both to environmental supply and to the citizen’s own political preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>While political discussion occurs frequently within socially cohesive groups, communication that occurs across the boundaries of cohesive groups may be more crucial to the dissemination of public opinion.</p></li>

<li><p>Table 4 demonstrates a micro environmental filter on the macro environmental flow of information. Those citizens whose patterns and habits of social interaction are contained within the bounded, cohesive confines of the family are also secluded from socially communicated information that is distinctive to the larger environment. In this sense, then, they are cut off from the informational consequences of divergent public opinion distributions, and their own opinions are uninformed by the partisan composition of the larger environment.</p></li>
<li><p>people with more non-relative discussants were also likely to have more discussants who were not close friends-an indicator that they were more weakly tied to their discussants (Granovetter 1973), and perhaps as a consequence, more directly tied to the larger climate of opinion.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-35">Abstract:</h3>
<p>No factor appears more powerful in explaining how individuals evaluate political information and form political preferences than partisanship. Yet, virtually all work on the effects of partisanship on preference formation neglects the crucial role of social settings. In this study, I examine how social settings can fundamentally change the influence of partisanship on preferences. I demonstrate that, in fact, social settings exert an independent influence over preference formation—one that is even larger than the influence of partisan ambivalence. The central implication of these findings is that, going forward, we cannot fully explore how citizens apply their partisanship in evaluating political information without also accounting for the social settings in which individuals find themselves.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-36">Abstract:</h3>
<p>At the center of debates on deliberative democracy is the issue of how much deliberation citizens experience in their social networks.These “disagreements about disagreement” come in a variety of forms, with scholars advocating different empirical approaches (e.g., Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004; Mutz 2006) and coming to different substantive conclusions. We address these discrepancies by going back to the basics: investigating the consequences of conceptual and measurement differences for key findings relating interpersonal political disagreement to political attitudes and behaviors. Drawing on the 2008–2009 ANES panel study, we find evidence that different measures of disagreement have distinct effects when it comes to individuals’ preferences, patterns of engagement, and propensities to participate. We discuss the implications for the study of social influence; as interpersonal disagreement can mean different things, scholars should think carefully about how to study it and should exercise caution when making pronouncements about its empirical and democratic consequences.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>conditional decision makers vote because campaigns mobilize them, either directly or by creating discussion that works through networks to spur conditional decision makers to act.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>she contrasts this with Verba, Brady, and Schlozman (1995) resource based theory of voter turnout.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>individuals choose to vote because they can, they like to, and they are asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is a cost/benefit analysis story</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Argument:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1) I provide a more complete exposition of my claim that all turnout is mobilized.</p></li>
<li><p>2) I then demonstrate that the social theory of turnout can account for a wide variety of previously documented empirical observations about turnout. These prior observations include aggregate patterns such as cross-national variation and cross-election variation, and individual-level correlations with political interest, civic resources, and requests to participate.</p></li>
<li><p>3) Finally, the conclusion of this chapter lays out ground where the social theory and resource-based view diverge, setting the stage for empirically testing the theories against one another in the chapters to follow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Campaigns increase salients which are reverberated through social networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Political discussion is likely to be casual or incidental; a mention of a candidate or an issue might serve as an indicator of interest or involvement.</p></li>
<li><p>Specifically, in the social theory of turnout, I assume that voters are more likely to cooperate unconditionally in lower-cost elections - an assumption supported by subject behavior in experiments. Thus, the social theory of turnout provides a sound theoretical account of the effects of costs on turnout, and has the advantage of producing empirically verifiable estimates of how costs affect decision making. Furthermore, the point estimates of how costs affect turnout in a cross-national setting obtained from simulations are eerily accurate, providing further support for the ability of the social theory of turnout to explain empirical turnout patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>what does she mean by unconditional?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I show that variation from each of these sources can be explained as the result of mobilization-induced changes in political discussion and other visible signals of political awareness or interest.</p></li>
<li><p>strategic politicians are at the root of almost all voter participation.</p></li>
<li><p>knowledge of an election “buzz” -&gt; increases discussion in networks</p></li>
<li><p>salience equals network size !!!!!!</p></li>
<li><p>Lower salience does not equal higher cost</p></li>
<li><p>I argue that all turnout is, in a sense, mobilized, with much of the mobilization occurring indirectly through increases in political discussion and general visibility of the upcoming election among potential voters. In this section, I introduce the final factor that accounts for individual turnout variation - latent differences in the potential of individuals to be mobilized indirectly - and argue that these latent differences are rooted in the differences in social structure that, in fact, cause much of the variation in individual turnout probabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>How does indirect mobilization work? Although I cannot pin down this process as precisely as might be ideal, we can speculate that citizens communicate to each other their own level of involvement in the political system through a variety of means, and that this communication increases the effective size of the social network relevant to the turnout decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Regardless of the conversational content, however, exposure to higher levels of political discussion, I suggest, increases the likelihood of voting. In terms of the model of social decision making, additional discussion increases the size of the reference group used by a citizen when deciding whether or not to vote, thus in effect increasing the size of one’s social network.</p></li>
