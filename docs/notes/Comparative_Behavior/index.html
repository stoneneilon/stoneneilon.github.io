<p><strong>Bumper Sticker: Rules &amp; context influence and are influenced by behaviour!</strong> (British spelling)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This article discusses and reviews the growing literature on the nexus of macro-level structures and individual behaviour that some studies are a part of. It looks at the effects that macro-level institutions and contexts have on citizen behaviour, along with how political institutions and the environment where citizens form opinions and act, help in moderating the effects of individual-level factors on citizen behaviour. The modelling structures and behaviour, effects of structures on voter behaviour, and the interactions of structures and behaviour in research on economic voting are some of the topics covered in the article.</p>
<p><strong>Outline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Does x cause behaviour y? It depends!</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Example: Does institutional performance affect people’s sense of whether their political system is legitimate?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer: The impact of corruption on system support is conditional on whether citizens are supporters of the incumbent government.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Studies are getting better at using institutions and context to predict the effects of citizen behaviour.</strong></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Comparative study of structures and behaviour = citizens in context&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Context and behaviour intimately connected by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Formal and informal rules; people’s preferences, attitudes, and behaviour affect the establishment and functioning of rules</li>
<li>Citizens are exposed to variable social, political, and economic environments that they are supposed to understand, interpret, and sometimes shape</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Advances in surveys, replication, and computing have allowed for cross-national and multi-level research into behaviour</p></li>
<li><p>1980s and 1990s renewed focus on institutional questions across polysci that could be tested, as well as interest in developing contextual theories of political behaviour</p></li>
<li><p>Comparative study of behaviour politics has investigated macro-level contexts/structures:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Institutions</p></li>
<li><p>Structural conditions</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Interaction between structures and behaviour presumes several things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Politics is about the interaction of people’s values and the rules and conditions that govern the implementation of those values</li>
<li>The rules and realities in which citizens make choices are themselves a function of people’s values
<ul>
<li>“Put another way: contexts are critical for understanding the decisions people make because they affect different people differently, and people’s decisions, in turn, shape the nature, shape, and stability of these contexts” (678).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Common approach assumes that context shapes behaviour; assumes behaviour to be DV and that it is exogenous and stable</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Do institutions have direct effects on behaviour?</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting example: structures can affect voters directly, indirectly, and interactively (or contingently)
<ul>
<li>Direct: rational choice theory; individuals weigh costs and benefits of voting and act accordingly</li>
<li>Indirect: behaviours of elites within electoral rules empower or constrain citizen choices; structures have consequences but these consequences have secondary (or indirect) effects on behaviour</li>
<li>Contingent: effect of some structural feature strengthened or weakened, depending on presence of some 3rd variable; the turnout gap between individuals with many and few resources is particularly pronounced in countries where the cost of voting is high</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>{INSERT PHOTO HERE}</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent studies have looked at how the nature of a country’s representative structures interacts with the willingness of voters to punish governments for bad economic performance
<ol type="1">
<li>Bad economy impact hinges on ability of voters to hold gov’t responsible</li>
<li>Institutions can hamper this ability of voters to reward or punish gov’ts</li>
<li>Clarity of responsibility also varies over time within (and across) countries b/c of election outcomes that change bargaining power and reshape context</li>
<li>Also contingent upon credible alternatives for voters to vote into office</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Interactions of vote choice and structures in research on legitimacy
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What role do institutions play in moderating sense of loss or victory citizens feel?</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions shape the responses of winners and losers; citizen attitudes toward democratic institutions shaped by country’s political context</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>“At the end of the day, what is particularly noteworthy about cross-level investigations of behavioural politics is that they hold the promise of producing a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of political life by connected hitherto unconnected streams of scholarship in the areas of institutions, political economy, policy, and behaviour and allowing us a better and more complex empirical and theoretical handle on the hows and whys of citizen politics” (690).</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="puzzle"><strong>PUZZLE</strong>:</h3>
<p>The intellectual left has a hard time reconciling the normative position of a&nbsp; “proletarian” revolution as a necessary progressive force and the evidence of a “totalitarian degeneration of Communism” (quoting “The Choice of Comrades,”Encounter, 3 (December 1954), p.&nbsp;25. Arnold A. Rogow, cited p.482).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="key-argument" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-argument">KEY ARGUMENT:</h3>
<p>Following evidence and psychological research on personality traits of&nbsp; different society’s strata, Lipset posits that the lower strata are predisposed to support&nbsp; authoritarianism due to a lack of “sophistication” and facing economic and psychological&nbsp; insecurity. The lower class will support economic liberalism but not political liberalism, while the&nbsp; middle and upper class will support political liberalism. Hence, according to Lipset, there is a&nbsp; natural link between the lower-class attitudes and their support of Communism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Pre-1914: working-class supported both economic and political liberalism&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Post-1914: “The intransigent, intolerant, and demonological aspects of Communist ideology attract members from the lower class of low-income, low-status occupations, and little education” (483).</p>

<p>• “Leftism/economic liberalism associated with socio-economic status” (485). • “Psychologically oriented investigators have studied the social correlates of authoritarian&nbsp; personality structures as measured by the now famous F scale”(Adorno, 1950, cited p.&nbsp; 486).&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Even in conservatism, economic status predicts tolerance levels (see Eysenck, 1956 and&nbsp; Stouffer, 1955, cited p.486)</p>

<p>• Fundamentalist and chiliastic/millennial religious tradition as a predisposition for drastic&nbsp; and rapid measures demanding authoritarian order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The appeal of fundamentalism to the lower class acts as a pressure valve in a utopian world&nbsp; where the upper class no longer dominates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• See Engels and his take on evangelism (488).&nbsp;</p>

<li><p>“There is consistent evidence that degree of formal education, itself closely correlated with&nbsp; social and economic status, is also highly correlated with undemocratic attitudes” (489). • Education predicts attitudes better than occupation (Morris Janowitz and Dwaine Marvick study, cited pp.489-490).&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Principal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of &nbsp;“sophistication,” economic security, and psychological security -&gt; mental shortcuts and&nbsp; need of immediacy = “surviving”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p>When the Communist Party is small and weak, it tends to uphold non-economic&nbsp; liberalism/democratic values because of the <strong>presence of intellectual leadership</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>When the Communist Party (or Socialist in some cases) is a mass party, it tends to be more&nbsp; authoritarian (or less committed to democratic values) because it has <strong>stripped its&nbsp; intellectual leadership</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Underdeveloped countries/economies exacerbate the problems of the lower class and&nbsp; increase the predisposition to authoritarianism on a like-for-like basis.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>This argument is evaluated subnationally and supports the urban/rural predisposition to&nbsp; uphold democratic values and political liberalism.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL PATTERNS AND DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Historically, the left has been responsible for democratization; intellectual leadership still&nbsp; supports democratic values, but the masses of the lower strata do not understand the&nbsp; implications of the left beyond economic value to them.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Conservatism is vulnerable in democracy for demographic reasons (500). • Neither conservatism nor the authoritarian predisposition of the lower class should be seen&nbsp; as a threat to democracy.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Educational attainment is an essential “Social Requisites of Democracy” (Lipset, 1959).&nbsp;</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This chapter offers an intellectual history of the critical texts that defined the research orientation of political behavior. Is focuses on how traditional theories from sociology and psychology informed our understanding of political behaviors through interactions with primary groups. However, along the way, the political science discipline that studied behavior began undergoing changes to the way behavioral study was approached - emphasizing, instead, individual level survey research and a reconceptualization of social logic. Fortunately, social logic is back on the mend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The immediate social circumstances of people’s lives influence what they believe and do about politics&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediate social circles are powerful forces in swaying ones political beliefs and actions&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group relationships are important for fixing and maintaining opinions in relation to large parts of the political system (such as parties) (Key, 1961)&nbsp;</p>

<p>particularly influential were Lazarsfeld, Katz, Berelson, Gaudet, and McPhee Electoral Sociology was where the onset of the behavioral revolution in political science first observed electoral choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting is a reflection of our behavior - of our conversations with other people and the attitudes we shape through those interactions&nbsp;</p>
<p>By this logic, we vote based on how the relationships we have shape us This is counter to theories of voting as a rational act&nbsp;</p>

<p>sharing an identity (social class, ethnicity, religion, etc.) does NOT define a social group&nbsp;</p>
<p>opinions, preferences, and beliefs are a joint function of how “real” the matter is, the views held by the members of a person’s groups, and the persons own conceptions joining a group tends to produce changes in opinions and attitudes toward alignment with the group&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Does the citizenry have the “capacity” to participate in democracy</strong>? Concern the age-old&nbsp; question of the demos’ potential to access information and process it in a way that would be&nbsp; individually coherent in election expressions. Converse’s (1964) “The Nature of Belief Systems&nbsp; in Mass Publics” marks a turning point since <strong>it can quantitatively/statistically demonstrate</strong></p>
<p>democracy defenders’ worst fears: the mass public competence for a normative functioning of&nbsp; democracy is blight. This question has also been approached with similar results by Lipmann (1922), “Public Opinion” and Schumpeter (1950), “Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy” (see&nbsp; also Bennett, 2006, “Democratic Competence, Before Converse and After”).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Converse stipulates that the degree of coherence of the mass public belief system is contingent on the level of constraints of the idea-elements populating a belief system: the more constrained, the&nbsp; more coherent. This, in turn, predicts a degree of capacity to participate in democracy according&nbsp; to one’s self-assessed ideological placement. Idea-elements are mainly constrained by the&nbsp; transmission of information and its digestibility. For this reason, Converse finds that 15% of the&nbsp; population is deemed ideologue or near-ideologue (possessing a coherent belief system = elite political actors). In contrast, the remaining 85% (the masses) float between having a particular&nbsp; interest (issue public) or having no idea. <strong>If ideology is not driving most of the public’s opinion&nbsp; incentive, what is?</strong> Converse suggests that “visible” social groupings serve as a stable heuristic&nbsp; informing public opinion: party ID (.70) has more bearing than policies, but policies concerning&nbsp; visible groups (school desegregation .45) have more bearing than regular policies (government and housing .28). This “ideology by proxy” might produce idiosyncratic outcomes as well: the&nbsp; working man associating with Socialists against the rich but against government reigning of private&nbsp; enterprise’s provision of public goods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article presents a survey and interpretation of the contributions made by #network #theories on the study of citizens and democratic policies. The article serves as an overview of the topic. It begins by locating the network research within the rich substantive and theoretical tradition of individually and #group-based studies of #electoral #politics and #public #opinion . It addresses some methodological issues in the study of political information #networks. The article ends with the discussion of theoretical and substantive insights that were generated in several studies, such as the study of communication and persuasion among citizens.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>The author sets out to analyze the contribution of network theories, which have provided us the ability to analyze citizen and democratic politics from across the micro-macro spectrum. Network theories draw on the importance of groups, communities, and political information networks among and between individuals (Downs 1957) while incorporating a conceptual apparatus that extends far past the traditional notions of primary groups, organizations, and societal groups in order to define the relationships that exist among individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Despite its advantages, there are still some methodological issues with network analysis.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Absent direct measures on patterns of communication, neither the individual measures nor their associated aggregate versions directly address the specifics of communication and persuasion among the individuals who make up the aggregates.</p></li>
<li><p>Network studies are particularly useful in analyzing well defined populations - such as clergies, political elites, court, and legislatures.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an unfortunate limitation of egocentric networks is the failure to embed dyads within larger networks and in the context of all other dyads in that same network.</p></li>
<li><p>However, they aren’t straightforward when analyzing large populations - which is the primary object of study for scholars concerned with studies of mass behavior (egocentric network survey questions and snowball surveys can help address this; pg. 5-6)</p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-substantive-and-theoretical-insights-generated-by-it">What are the substantive and theoretical insights generated by it?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>People are more inclined to discuss politics with others who share similar political beliefs</p></li>
<li><p>Studies ALSO demonstrate that patterns of both agreement and disagreement can be profitably understood within complex processes of communication and persuasion</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that there is persistent heterogeneity of opinions in less-dense (larger) social networks people aren’t as afraid of disagreement as we initially thought</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Political heterogeneity in the form of cross cutting cleavages can depress political participation BUT increased levels of tolerance (which might be good?)</p></li>
<li><p>Political communication networks are more important in less developed democracy, where parties are less institutionalize and politics is more volatile</p></li>
<li><p>Diversity of group discussion decreases the susceptibility of individuals to issue framing by elites</p></li>
<li><p>Network studies of political communication and persuasion provide a theoretical, analytical response to the human limitations of the citizen in democratic politics.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is important because it to do with the cognitive limitations of individuals in being self-contained, fully informed, independent maximizers</p></li>
<li><p>particularly useful is social capital - which allows people to rely on one another for accurate information</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>political interdependence among citizens helps to explain why public opinion in the aggregate is more sophisticated than the opinions held by the average citizen - its more fully informed</p></li>

<p>The literature shows an interaction between threat and public preference for authoritarianism. There are two lines of literature that provide contradictory findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One argues that threat increases authoritarian preferences among those that are more prone to authoritarianism</p></li>
<li><p>Another argues that threat is associated with a switch in ideology among those who are normally non-authoritarian Using a two-wave panel study of the French population taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris, the authors find that the two occur simultaneously.</p></li>

<section id="theoryargument" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theoryargument">Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>The authors argue that the endorsement of authoritarian policies can be explained by the theory of affective intelligence. When people experience anxiety due to novel circumstances, such as that induced by terrorist attacks, they will abandon their habitual political attachments and attend to the circumstance in a risk-averse and conservative manner.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>H1:</strong> increased anger will enhance decision making based on past dispositional convictions, leading to increased polarization between left and right wing individuals (strengthen authoritarian tendencies for right-wing and weaken those same tendencies for the right)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>H2:</strong> increased anxiety will initiate decision-making that is less reliant on extant convictions and hence make those on the left end of the left-right scale more attentive and responsive to calls from the right to adopt authoritarian policies.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-theoryargument">Summary of Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>The authors postulate what they call a theory of affect-driven motivated reasoning in trying to explain when and why citizens actively process biased information. This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being “motivated- skepticals” when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e.&nbsp;spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of “partisan processing” that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:</p>
<p><strong>H1:</strong> there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs</p>
<p><strong>H2:</strong> there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments</p>
<p><strong>H3:</strong> there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones</p>
<p><strong>These combined will results in:</strong></p>
<p><strong>H4:</strong> attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments</p>
<p><strong>Which is conditional upon:</strong></p>
<p><strong>H5:</strong> the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism</p>
<p><strong>H6:</strong> and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.</p>

<p>How (if at all) can we create a multi-item scale that measures partisanship across multi-party systems?</p>
</section>
<section id="summarytheoryargument-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-1">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>Most national election studies tend to rely on a single measure of partisanship. Such measurements tend to vary in terms of how they are phrased on surveys and also struggle to capture the range of partisan identity, typically at the low and high ends of the spectrum. The authors believe that they can develop a multi-item scale of partisan identity that better predicts political behavior ACROSS various multiparty democracies than the traditional single item scales common on surveys.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="partisan-identity-scale">Partisan Identity Scale</h4>
<p>Creates an Eight-Item Scale of Partisanship that is derived from Social Identity Theory Derives three (3) hypothesis to test whether the scale is better than traditional models: <strong>H1</strong>: The Partisan Identity Scale should differentiate equally well among low, middling, and high levels of identity to best uncover the link between identity and political activity across its full range. Expect each scale item to provide more complete information about partisan strength than the traditional single party identification item.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of the IRT analysis, this means that each item’s information function will be more peaked and contain greater information than the standard single measure of partisan strength. In the three European multi-party systems under study, we expect both lower and higher levels of partisan intensity to remain less well detected when measured with the traditional item</p>
<p><strong>H2:</strong> the partisan identity scale to exhibit all three types of invariance, which means that the fit of the metric invariance model will be no worse than the fit of the configural model, and that the fit of the scalar model will be no worse than that of the metric model.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>H3:</strong> The partisan identity scale should more powerfully predict in-party voting and political engagement than the traditional party identification item. We also expect the partisan identity scale to better predict political behavior than a multi-item indicator of ideological intensity&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods-1">Methods:</h3>
<p>the methods are pretty complex, but essentially each hypothesis undergoes a different set of tests/inquiry.&nbsp;<br>
<strong>H1</strong> - figure 1 shows how the 8 item scale that the authors derived is better measure of latent partisan strength than the individual measures in each country. This is also event in the peaks that you can see in each figure. They are more much more sensitive to to the full range of the low- high spectrum. <strong>H2</strong> - invariance is measured using R software to perform multi-group confirmatory analysis (CFA) Configural invariance is a good fit&nbsp;</p>

<p>Keele and Wolak seek to explain why some people are more prone to #partisan “instability” (or “volatility”) than others. To the authors, the reason for this has to do with the “hierarchy of values”. When people have obvious values that rank higher than others (humanitarianism, egalitarianism, equality) AND these #values align with political elites values, then partisan identity remains a steady tool with which to measure the political world against. HOWEVER, for some people, the values rank similarly and therefore cause conflicting #preferences that individuals struggle to resolve. Competing values will produce #volatility in partisan opinions specifically when individuals endorse values that cross the fault lines of partisan dialogue&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-2">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Many students of British voting patterns have tested for the existence of contextual effects, which postulate that voters are influenced by events and people in their local milieux. One of those contextual effects is the neighborhood effect, whereby individuals are influenced by the nature of the politically relevant information circulating within their social networks, many of which are spatiallyconstrained to their local area. Although ecological analyses have identified patterns consistent with this hypothesis, there have been virtually no direct investigations of the effect, largely because of the absence of relevant data. Using information from a large, clustered survey of voters at the time of the 1992 general election, this paper uncovers clear evidence of such effects: people are much more likely to change their votes in a particular direction if those with whom they discuss political issues support that direction, especially if they are members of the respondent’s family and are the individuals with whom they discuss politics most.</p>

<p>Does the neighborhood effect have an impact on voter decisions?</p>
</section>
<section id="summarytheoryargument-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-3">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>Most researchers have accepted that voters are influence by their immediate social and geographical environments as well as their own individual circumstances. However, the way in which such contextual factors operate is contested. Most explanations point to spatial variation in economic and political contexts and the driving force behind voter’s decisions. That is, “nonsocial” context on economic and political conditions at the local and national level compose the voting repertoire with which individuals draw on at the polls.</p>
<p>However, the authors speculate that the influence of immediate social networks (family, friends, colleagues) on individual opinions informs their voting behavior. Early research explored such possibilities, but scarcity of data left this “neighborhood effect” to be abandoned if favor of explanations that could be explored.</p>
</section>
<section id="hypothesis-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hypothesis-2">Hypothesis:</h3>
<p>Main hypothesis: Each group would be influenced by the dominant nature of electorally relevant information in their social networks—those who changed the party that they supported should be in networks where support for their new party is strong, whereas those who remained loyal to a party should be in networks that give it strong support.</p>

<section id="datamethods-6" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="datamethods-6">Data/Methods:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Explores contextual effects on voting behavior in Great Britain</p></li>
<li><p>Uses data collected in the British Election Study (BES) from the 1992 British General Election, which lends itself to the data requirement of networks of people living in the same locality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The data uses a cluster rather than a random sample: 210 “points” (which are polling districts made up of 1,000-2,000 voters).</p></li>
<li><p>Used a stratified random design with a random sample of respondents selected from the electoral roll for the district</p></li>
<li><p>Produces 2,526 individuals with an average sample size of around 16 per cluster, with a peaked distribution between 16 and 19</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Authors chose to focus on why some respondents, from their own recollection, changed their vote between 1987 and 1992 while others did not</p></li>
<li><p>By aggregating the reported 1987 votes of each BES respondent by polling district, the authors were able to estimate the vote share there for each of the three main political parties that fought in all British constituencies in both 1987 and 1992: Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat (Alliance in 1987).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>First analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contrasts those who switched their vote to a particular party in 1992 (coded 1) against those who didn’t (coded 0)</p></li>
<li><p>Gives 3 dependent variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. switch to conservative 2) switch to labor 3) switch to Liberal</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Employs a Logistic Regression (because the DVs are binary)</p></li>
<li><p>Then does the same thing but looks at those who defected (voted for each party in 1987) So those who voted for a particular party in 1987 and again in 1992 (the loyalists) against those that voted for another party/ didn’t vote at all in 1992 (the defectors)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Second analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>looks at the impact of conversations with the individuals respondents named as the first (primary) discussant of politics and analyzing how that affected transitions to each party</p></li>
<li><p>Measures those who who didn’t vote for the same party in 1992 as they did in 1987 against those who did</p></li>
<li><p>Also looks at those who defected versus those who didn’t</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Third analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assesses the degree to which cross cutting relationships impact vote choice by bringing in two additional discussants that the respondents listed</p></li>
<li><p>The more discussants who support a particular party, the greater the expected probability that an individual will switch to that party, and the less the probability that he or she will defect from it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fourth analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s possible that discussants don’t live in the same neighborhood (i.e.&nbsp;context) as the respondent. Therefore, there a chance that political context and conversations on voting linked, or could they be separate?</p></li>
<li><p>hypothesize that the more support a party has in a locality (the independent variables employed in the regressions reported in Tables 3 and 4), the greater the probability that individuals there will encounter, talk to, and be converted by that party’s partisans</p></li>
<li><p>tested by dividing the respondents according to how many discussants they report having a particular partisanship, which can vary from 0 to 3.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="findings-8" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings-8">Findings:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Social networks are indeed important influences on voting decisions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Families who talk together, vote together! (kinda) - voters were more likely to vote/not vote for a party based on conversations they had with their families</p></li>
<li><p>More accurately: those who talked together tended to vote together.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversations with friends are also important</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>First analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>the more their local area was dominated by supporters of a particular party, the greater the probability that individuals switched their support to that party between 1987 and 1992—if they had not voted for it at the first of those two election</p></li>
<li><p>local context did not influence voters’ decisions to abandon a party they have previously supported, but that the choice of which party to switch their support to was influenced by local conditions—which is the hypothesized mechanism that underlies the neighborhood effect.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Second analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Those who did not voter conservative in 1987 were more likely to vote conservative in 1992 if their primary discussant was conservative</p>
<ul>
<li>talking to Labour or Liberal party discussants made not conservative voters less likely to vote conservative (duh)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Same results hold for other parties - voters were more likely to vote for a particular party if the primary discussant was a member of that party</p></li>
<li><p>Frequency of conversation about politics appeared to have no influence</p></li>
<li><p>those people who voted for a party in 1987 were less likely to vote for another party in 1992 if their primary discussant had been a supporter of the same parter when compared to their discussant being from another party or having no discussant at all</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Third analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More likely to support and less likely to defect if the discussants were from the same party</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fourth Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a respondent had more discussants from a particular party, then there was also an associated increase in the number of votes for that party in the respondents district</p></li>
<li><p>This shows that there is a link between spatial and communicative contexts, supporting the neighboring effects.</p></li>

<p>This article examines recent trends in #Latin-American #voting-behavior and casts them in terms of sincere (economic) and strategic (electoral) concerns. It argues that thanks to years of economic adversity, Latin Americans have developed long, sophisticated #economic-memories . Although this has resulted in rising frustration with democratic government, according to recent opinion polls, it has not always led voters to #punish all parties responsible for hardship at election time. A panel study of the region’s presidential systems demonstrates that citizens punish incumbents by voting for established #nonincumbents when electoral laws reduce opportunities available to small parties in the systems, even if #nonincumbents have also been blamed for hard economic times. More #permissive-electoral-systems , in contrast, encourage citizens to reject all parties responsible for economic decline. The analysis demonstrates how economic and electoral concerns interact to affect voting behavior, #political-accountability , and #public-opinion in Latin America.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-4">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>Many Latin American economies have experienced some form poor performance that has resulted in different forms of electoral punishment. Barton, drawing on previous literature regarding economic theories of voter behavior, devises a theory that enables her to assess the institutional features that interact with economic performance to determine who voters choose to punish in subsequent elections. In highly permissible systems, where there are more parties to choose from, voters memories of economic performance can interact with electoral strategies to allow the punishment of multiple parties (as has been the case in multiple countries). However, more restrictive systems, which limit the number of viable parties, forces voters to focus their punishing efforts on the incumbent alone, as they require an alternative option of some form and therefore increases support for the form incumbent.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose">Purpose:</h3>
<p>This is a literature review on micro-level, survey research studies of economic voting in the U.S., Britain, France, and Globally.</p>
</section>
<section id="overview" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview:</h3>
<p>Questions regarding the precise nature of economic voting led to four general “types”.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Retrospective Voting
<ol type="1">
<li>Originating with V.O. Key (1966), this type of voting occurs when voters review the performance of the incumbent government.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Prospective Voting
<ol type="1">
<li>Originating with Downs (1957), this type of voting occurs when voters look to the future and vote according to the governments potential economic performance.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Pocketbook Voting (personal finances)
<ol type="1">
<li>This theory of voting suggests that when personal or household financial conditions have deteriorated, voters will punish the incumbent.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Sociotropic Voting (national economy rather than personal finances).
<ol type="1">
<li>This theory of voting suggests that voters are more likely to be considering the national economic situation when casting their vote.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Of these types, the retrospective sociotropic and prospective sociotropic appear to be the most relevant across empirical evaluations. That is, people tend to vote based of their perceptions of national economic performance, both in the past (retrospective sociotropic) and the future (prospective sociotropic). The type of voting that is cued depends on whether or not an incumbent is running, and therefore a reliable place to point blame. Essentially, the reward-punishment hypothesis holds up across settings, with slight variation according to group membership (party id, gender, etc.), institutional context (voting system, prime-minister v. president, number of parties) and economic context (personal, neighborhood, national).</p>

<section id="united-states" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="united-states">United States:</h4>
<ul>
<li>ANES is good source for election studies</li>
<li>Most theories of economic voting focus on the U.S.</li>
<li>Pocketbook voting is weak in presidential elections -- sociotropic is strong</li>
<li>Strength of economic voting can cary based on context -- such is the case when considering the attribution of responsibility (e.g.&nbsp;the attribution of blame to particular party/candidate/branch of government)
<ul>
<li>in the U.S. the presidency is an important institutional context for which to blame punish electorally</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While other types of factors matter and interact them, sociotropic economic effects (both retrospective and prospective) themselves cannot be understated when assessing the general behavior of the voter population.</li>
</ul>

<section id="britain" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="britain">Britain:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BES is a good source for election studies</li>
<li>British voters show the same trends of reward and punishment regarding economic voting</li>
<li>There may be important regional contexts
<ul>
<li>Johnston 1997 finds that when voter’s perceptions of their neighborhoods are that they are worse off, they will punish the incumbent</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Retrospective and Prospective are both important</li>
<li>Perceptual shifts in economic conditions are almost as great as realigning with a different party (Clarke et al.&nbsp;2004)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="france" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="france">France:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eurobarometer and FNES are good sources for election studies</li>
<li>A general finding—significant retrospective sociotropic effects, but no retrospective pocketbook effects</li>
<li>It is largely sociotropic and more or less equally retrospective or prospective, depending in part on the institutional context.</li>
<li>The French voter is sophisticated, knowing whom and how much to blame.
<ul>
<li>When government is unified, the president is the lightning rod for economic discontent. However, under cohabitation, the burden shifts to the prime minister.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smaller parties are blamed less than large parties, legislative candidates are blamed less than presidential candidates, and presidential candidates who are prime minister are blamed more than presidential candidates who are not prime minister.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cross-national-studies" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-national-studies">Cross-National Studies:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Similar trends have been found in cross-national studies
<ul>
<li>Lewis‐Beck and Mitchell (1990), on the five major western European countries; Chappell and Veiga (2000), on thirteen western European nations; Pacek (1994) and Tucker (2001) on central European samples; Remmer (1991) on twelve Latin American countries; Pacek and Radcli (1995) on eight low‐income nations; Wilkin, Haller, and Norporth (1997) on a worldwide sample of countries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Important Takeaways:
<ul>
<li><p>Responsibility Hypothesis seems to hold - that when responsibility is hard to pin down, voters are less likely to punish incumbents - this is an important contextual factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Such is the case in more countries with more “coalitional complexity” -- when more parties make up the incumbent government, is it difficult to assign blame</p></li>
<li><p>Presidential Systems and systems with more restrictive electoral laws tend to strengthen the economic vote</p></li>
<li><p>In the context of globalization, there is a significant decrease in economic voting in the face of open trade, as electorates can’t assign blame to the government alone</p></li>

<p>What explains cross-national variation in the gender division of labor and the gender voting gap?</p>
</section>
<section id="summaryargument" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summaryargument">Summary/Argument:</h3>
<p>The traditional “efficiency model” proposed by economists in explaining gender division of labor as the the outcome of a coordination game, whereby specialization in household versus market skills are reinforced by childhood socialization intended to maximize offsprings chances of success later in life, is itself incapable of explaining the stark differences in female labor force participation across economies of comparable levels of development.</p>
<p>Builds on economic bargaining models to show that the division of labor puzzle can only be understood by treating marriage as a incomplete contract that is potentially subject to termination. When such is the case, both men and women have an incentive to cultivate their outside options by entering into paid work, and the distribution of unpaid work is determined by bargaining powers dependent upon the political-economic factors outside the family.</p>
<p>What is important is that divorce is an option that varies across contexts. In places where divorce is a more viable, then outside options become important for long-term welfare. Meaning that both sexes will prefer social and economic policies that maximize these options, even if it reduces household income or other measures of aggregate welfare.</p>
<p>Men are disincentivized to support their wives working because 1.) it increases her agency/options to exit the marriage and 2.) increases the amount of work he has to do in the home. Additionally, women in specific skills economies typically bear a bigger penalty for career interruptions such as for child rearing, they face more limited work opportunities and may invest less in their market-relevant education as a result. This, in turn, weakens their bargaining power at home, and they get stuck sweeping floors more of the time than their counterparts in economies that specialize in general skills. This occurs unless the government steps in and adopts policies to counter the disadvantages of women in specific skills countries. This is where the gender gap in preferences enters the story.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-4">Abstract:</h3>
<p>As the American political landscape becomes increasingly divided along urban–rural lines, it raises the prospect of deepening social identities that are tied to one’s community-type. As community-type becomes an important social identity, it can lead to favoritism of one’s community in-group, or denigration of one’s community out-group. We explore the extent to which urban and rural identities exist above and beyond other factors like party and race, and whether they are consequential for the ways in which people evaluate the political and non-political world. Using national survey data, we demonstrate that people in both urban and rural locations hold beliefs that are consistent with a community-type social identity that is independent of other factors which are correlated with the urban–rural divide. We use two different experiments to assess the consequences of this identity, finding that there are distinct effects in the political arena when allocating government resources, and in the non-political world when judging hypothetical job applications. These effects are generally smaller in magnitude than other factors, such as partisanship, but suggest that community-type identities are important in politics.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-5">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>Lyons and Utych set out to assess what appears to be a growing divide between rural and urban party affiliation and voting patterns.They explore the extent to which people use information about rural and urban community types to form impressions about American politics, as well as how people use this information to make decisions about political and non-political matters. If people are using urban and rural identities in similar ways to partisanship, and partisanship uses group identity as a way of perceiving the world, then there is a chance that people may be using geographic information such as urban and rural community type to evaluate the political and interpersonal landscape around them.</p>
<p>They focus on discriminatory behaviors. If urban and rural community types are taking on the qualities of social identities, then the in-group and out-group processing of information along lines of community type should be salient. That is, those from urban (rural) locations should confer a preference to urban (rural) locations/people, and a penalty to rural (urban) locations/people when making decisions that allocate resources, benefits, or opportunities.</p>

<section id="general-notes-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-notes-3">General Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Most studies ignore women’s participation in VPOs</p></li>
<li><p>If they do examine this phenomenon, it’s through case studies or small-N studies, and focused on “supply-side” dynamics (what characteristics condition women towards violence) rather then “demand-side” dynamics (ways in which different organizational preferences &amp; behaviors work to facilitate or impede women’s presence in VPOs)</p>
<ul>
<li>“Women’s voluntary participation in violent politics is tied invariably to the availability of opportunities” (489)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>3 assumptions:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Recruiter and female participants choose purposefully among action alternatives to maximize benefits and minimize costs (everyone thinks like an economist)</p></li>
<li><p>Each organization’s ability to succeed depends on ability to attract and retain members willing to engage in violence</p></li>
<li><p>To be successful, leaders must be able to persuade potential members to overcome collective action problems while frustrating opponents’ ability to do the same</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Reasons for why women join VPOs mimic reasons why individuals join; that is, they are not particular to women</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply-side reasons alone not enough to explain variation in participation between men and women in VPOs</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Case study: Eritrea (1961-1991) and their war for independence</p>

<ul>
<li><p>According to theories of racial threat, rising numbers of immigrants will threaten long-time residents’ political power and economic status</p>
<ul>
<li>This generates political hostility in heavily immigrant areas</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This article develops the politicized places hypothesis to explain how and when local demographics influence attitude and local politics</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3 factors minimize threat immigrants pose to long-time residents:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immigrants are often unable to vote</p></li>
<li><p>Immigrants tend to work in segmented labor markets</p></li>
<li><p>Immigrants tent to live in segregated communities</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Politicized places hypothesis (PPH): when communities are undergoing sudden demographic changes at the same time that salient national rhetoric politicizes immigration, immigrants can quickly become the targets of local political hostility</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Realistic group threat: the presence of an outgroup in sufficient numbers will generate competition for scarce resources and thus local hostility</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Local; threat might be acute in places of relative/increasing resource deprivation or rising outgroup political power</p></li>
<li><p>These assumptions don’t hold for immigrants – leads to politicized places hypothesis</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Politicizted places hypothesis assertions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Resolves issue of local inattention to demographics by arguing that while levels of ethnic heterogeneity might escape notice, changes are less likely to do so</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Demographic changes might not be seen as having political ramifications unless frames are available that make those ramifications clear</p></li>
<li><p>Past work presents compelling evidence that framing effects can shape extent to which Americans’ attitudes toward public policies are racialized</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>PPH specifies conditions of everyday life that make symbols or rhetoric more or less influential</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Central claim of PPH: At times when rhetoric related to immigrants is highly salient nationally, those witnessing influxes of immigrants locally will find it easier to draw political conclusions from their experiences.</p>

<li><p>Previous research on tolerance has often mixed up the concepts of tolerance and prejudice, leading to various problems. To address this issue, this research aims to differentiate between the two.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>conflation of tolerance with prejudice has made it difficult to understand what tolerance truly means and how it differs from dislike or disapproval of certain groups.</p></li>
<li><p>distinguishing analytically between tolerance and prejudice.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>define tolerance as an abstract value orientation towards diversity, without focusing on specific groups, ideas, or behaviors. This allows authors to analyze tolerance both within societies and across different societies.</p></li>
<li><p>suggests that tolerance is best understood as a three-dimensional concept, involving acceptance of, respect for, and appreciation of difference.</p></li>
<li><p>found that only an appreciation of difference has the potential to reduce prejudice.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>demonstrates the validity of these measures and their independence from welfare attitudes.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Results suggest that only an appreciation of difference can reduce prejudice, but relationship btwn tolerance/other outcomes remain unclear.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are two main approaches to studying tolerance.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first sees tolerance as permitting something disliked, suggesting that prejudice is necessary for tolerance.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This view implies that one can only be tolerant if they’ve been prejudiced before. Empirical studies following this approach often start with the assumption that certain groups are widely disliked.</p></li>
<li><p>However, this method makes it hard to separate tolerance from prejudice in practice.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The second approach defines tolerance as a positive response to diversity itself, without requiring prior prejudice.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This view focuses on subjective reactions to diverse values, behaviors, and lifestyles.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Although this conceptualization is analytically distinct from prejudice, previous studies using this definition still rely on measures of prejudice, limiting our understanding of tolerance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Both approaches have methodological issues. They either link tolerance closely to prejudice or fail to measure tolerance in a way consistent with its definition.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Additionally, previous research has often overlooked the multidimensionality of tolerance and lacks abstraction in its conceptualization and measurement.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>To address these limitations, the study advances a new conception of tolerance and develops measures consistent with this definition, avoiding the pitfalls of previous approaches.</p></li>
<li><p>propose a new understanding of tolerance as a value orientation towards difference, which focuses on how individuals respond to diversity itself rather than merely putting up with disliked aspects.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>This definition is abstract and distinct from previous concepts, not requiring the identification of objectionable groups or behaviors.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>draw on Forst’s dimensions of tolerance:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acceptance</p></li>
<li><p>respect for difference</p></li>
<li><p>appreciation of difference.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These dimensions represent different levels of engagement with diversity, ranging from basic acceptance to a deeper appreciation.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>this approach allows for the measurement of various expressions of tolerance without relying on specific groups or behaviors, making our measures politically and temporally neutral.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>This framework provides a clearer understanding of tolerance and facilitates its empirical investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>8 positively worded items were selected to capture three dimensions of tolerance: acceptance, respect, and appreciation.&nbsp;</p></li>

<p>Sears and Brown (2013) employ a life history perspective (framework) to understanding how political orientations evolve across the human lifespan. The use of this framework provides some helpful insights:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Is addresses the constant tension between continuity and change as played out throughout an individuals lifespan</p></li>
<li><p>It helps us to understand the origins of orientations that are politically consequential among adults, whether concerning politics specifically or intergroup relations.&nbsp;</p></li>

<section id="findings-23" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings-23">Findings:</h3>
<p>This review has suggested that partisan predispositions are most likely to be acquired in early development, if not quite as uniformly early as originally thought.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The authors suggest that this is due the role of “time” which is treated as an independent variable that takes three forms</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The persisting effects of early experiences</p></li>
<li><p>The major events or “the times” that characterize the environment an individual has experienced&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>The life stages of development - children, adolescents, adults all have different cognitive capabilities&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Based on the various ways fo thinking about time, the authors pose four alternative models of the full political life cycel that are often contrasted in the literature and which speak to Campbell’s conception of party identification being shaped by early learning behavior, persistence, and later influence on voting behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>four alternative models of the full political life cycle have often been contrasted:&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>(1) persistence: the residues of preadult learning persist through life;&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>(2) a variant, impressionable years: orientations are particularly susceptible to influence in late adolescence and early adulthood, but tend to stabilize thereafter</p></li>
<li><p>(3) its major alternative, lifelong openness: individuals remain open to influence throughout later life, including by “the times”</p></li>
<li><p>(4) life cycle: people show distinctive specific propensities at different stages of life (this one is particularly difficult to pin down)</p></li>

<p><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The life history perspective of political development is a theoretical framework within political science that draws on insights from biology, psychology, and sociology to understand the trajectory of political systems over time. This perspective views political development as akin to the life cycle of an organism, with distinct stages of growth, maturation, decline, and potential renewal.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Key features of the life history perspective of political development include:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Stages of Development:</strong> Similar to biological life cycles, political systems are seen to progress through various stages of development. These stages may include periods of consolidation, expansion, crisis, and transformation. Each stage is characterized by specific challenges, opportunities, and dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptation to Environmental Pressures:</strong> Just as organisms adapt to their environments to survive and thrive, political systems must adapt to changing societal, economic, and environmental conditions. This may involve institutional reforms, policy adjustments, or shifts in political strategies to address new challenges or opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Allocation and Trade-offs:</strong> The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resource allocation and trade-offs in political development. Political systems must allocate scarce resources, such as financial capital, human capital, and political capital, among competing priorities and objectives. Decisions about resource allocation may have long-term implications for the trajectory of political development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reproduction and Inheritance:</strong> Political systems often inherit institutional legacies, cultural norms, and social structures from previous generations. These inherited traits shape the opportunities and constraints faced by contemporary political actors and influence the trajectory of political development. Similarly, political systems may reproduce themselves through processes of institutional continuity, elite reproduction, and socialization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variation and Diversity:</strong> Just as biological organisms exhibit variation and diversity within and across species, political systems display variation and diversity in their structures, institutions, and practices. The life history perspective recognizes that different political systems may follow distinct trajectories of development due to historical legacies, cultural norms, and contextual factors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptive Responses to External Shocks:</strong> Political systems may face external shocks and disruptions, such as economic crises, wars, or natural disasters, that necessitate adaptive responses. The life history perspective emphasizes the importance of resilience and flexibility in responding to external shocks and maintaining political stability and legitimacy.</p></li>

<p>Partisanship is apparently a really salient predictor of mate choice lol&nbsp;</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>
<p>Intergroup behavior: “Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, collectively or individually, with another group or its members in terms of their group identification, we have an instance of intergroup behavior.”</p>

<li><p>From Individual to Group Impressions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>How cognitive structures determine certain aspects of intergroup attitudes.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We are trying to understand cognitive processes and relate it to interpersonal behavior.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Discussion of stereotypes&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Cognitive mechanism: since members of minority groups often represent “infrequent” stimuli and therefore a conjunction of their relatively rare appearance with some of their actions lends itself to the construction of “illusionary correlations” and thus to stereotyping.”&nbsp;</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Solo status research: When an individual is not part of the group or they are “solo” (think Black man with a group of white men), the Black man will have polarized evaluations compared with evaluations of the same person identified as belonging to the majority group. Aka more variation in view of Black man from white colleagues compared to less variation in view of white guy by white colleagues.&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Note: this is not equal across group identities. Some groups still face this issue more than others when the group is mixed. Seems kind of like a primitive concept of intersectionality being developed.&nbsp;</li>

<p>“The characterization of The Civic Culture as celebrating popular apathy came out of a popular mood that extended into academic circles, which accorded little importance to the policy-making and performances side of democratic government. It overlooked the fact that democracy not only required popular participation but that elected leaders had also to govern, and that governing required obligation, patience, and trust. It was this necessary mix of activism and participation with other important ingredients that The Civic Culture celebrated.” (preface)&nbsp;</p>

<li>The civic culture is a participant political culture in which the political culture and political structure are congruent. P.30&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is democratic culture? How does it spread? What attitudes and behaviors must be present to create democracy?</p></li>
<li><p>Democracy is maintained by an active citizenry. More info, more involvement, and a sense of civic responsibility are essential.&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p>A bit concerned about these choices.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>These countries help escape an American focus - I disagree.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Political Culture:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Refers specifically to political orientations - attitudes toward the political system and its various parts, and attitudes towards the role of the self in the system.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Psychological orientation to social objects.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>When we speak of the political culture of a society, we refer to the political system as internalized in the cognitions, feelings, and evaluations of its population. People are inducted into it just as they are socialized into nonpolitical roles and social systems. P.13&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The political culture of a nation is a particular distribution of patterns of orientation toward political objects among the members of a nation. What are those orientations? (see below)&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Political Orientation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Orientation refers to the internalized aspects of objects and relationships.</p></li>
<li><p>Includes three types:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1) cognitive orientation - knowledge and belief about political system</p></li>
<li><p>2) affective orientation - feelings about political system&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>3) evaluational orientation - judgments and opinions about political objects&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We have classified orientation but we now must classify objects of political orientation.&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>System as general object&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Input objects &nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Output objects&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Self as object&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Characterizing political culture is done by understanding the various orientations toward the various objects. The types of political culture according to the authors are:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Parochial Political Culture</p></li>
<li><p>Subject Political Culture&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Participant Political Culture&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>“In the civic culture participant political orientations combine with and do not replace subject and parochial political orientations. Individuals become participants in the political process, but they do not give up their orientations as subjects or parochials.” p.30&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>“Thus attitudes favorable to participation within the political system play a major role in the civic culture, but so do such nonpolitical attitudes as trust in other people and social participation in general. The maintenance of these more traditional attitudes and their fusion with the participant orientations lead to a balanced political culture in which political activity, involvement, and rationality exist but are balanced by passivity, traditionality, and commitment to parochial values.” p.30</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The connecting link between micro and macro politics is political culture.</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>There is an integral link between the structure of civil life in a multiethnic society, on the one hand, and the presence or absence of ethnic violence, on the other.</p></li>
<li><p>Interethnic and intraethnic networks of civic engagement play very different roles in ethnic conflict.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Interethnic networks&nbsp; are agents of peace b/c they build bridges and manage tensions</p></li>
<li><p>If communities are organized along only intraethnic lines and interconnections with other communities are very weak/nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Both intraethnic and interethnic civic networks can be further broken down into organized and quotidian types based on whether civic interaction is formal or informal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Associational forms of engagement = formal civic interaction; business associations, professional organizations, reading clubs, film clubs, sports clubs, NGOs, trade unions, and cadre-based political parties</p></li>
<li><p>Everyday forms of engagement = informal civic interaction; family visits, eating together regularly, joint participation in festivals, allowing children to play together</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both forms of engagement promote peace; their absence or weakness opens up space for ethnic violence</p></li>
<li><p>Associational forms more influential</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>India as case study: much of India’s associational civic structure put into place in the 1920s as movement against the British with 2 goals:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ethnicity, ethnic conflict, and civil society&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ethnicity = the set to which religion, race, language, and sect belong as subsets in a broad definition of ascriptive group identities</p></li>
<li><p>Ethnic conflict = disagreement between different ethnic groups over resources, identity, patronage, and policies; not necessarily violent</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethnic peace = an absence of violence, not an absence of conflict</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Civil society = formal and informal societal groups that engage citizens??</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The puzzle</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Despite ethnic diversity, some places remain peaceful while others experience enduring patterns of violence. <strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The importance of studying levels of variance in independent variables</p></li>
<li><p>For this project, all reported Hindu-Muslim riots in India 1950-1995 used</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unit of analysis = towns/cities (disproportionate share of communal violence)</p></li>
<li><p>6 cities selected: 3-riot prone and 3 peaceful, then paired</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Aligarh &amp; Calicut – population percentage pairing</p></li>
<li><p>Hyderabad &amp; Lucknow – 2 controls added; previous Muslim rule and “reasonable cultural similarities”</p></li>
<li><p>Ahmedabad &amp; Surat – from same state of Gujarat sharing history, language, and culture but not violence (hard test)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The arguments linking ethnic conflict and civil society (theory)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“The preexisting local networks of civic engagement between the two communities stand out as the single most important proximate explanation for the difference between peace and violence” (374).</p></li>
<li><p>2 mechanisms connecting civil society and ethnic conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Civic networks often make neighborhood-level peace possible by promoting communication between members of different religious communities</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustained prior interaction or cordiality facilitated this</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If vibrant formal organizations serving the economic, cultural, and social needs of the 2 communities exist, the support for communal peace tends to be strong and more solidly expressed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Paradox: rural India has far fewer formal associations and the least amount of violence</p></li>
<li><p>See Figure 1: relationship between size and civic links</p>
<ul>
<li><p>N represents # of persons in a village/city</p></li>
<li><p>K represents # of links that must be made to connect everyone</p></li>
<li><p>For a given level of civic density (in this case, each person connected to everyone else), K rises faster than N</p></li>
<li><p><strong>K = N(N-1)/2</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Associations link individuals and communities</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-notes-9">General Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Neighborhood attachment = place sentiment toward a neighborhood&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Neighborhood attachment is a prerequisite for any form of participation</p></li>
<li><p>Social capital needed for mobilization</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, neighborhood attachment + social capital = neighborhood participation</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Introduction</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Citizen participation in neighborhoods important to improve environment, facilitating local services, maintaining social order, and enhancing community capacity</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the driving forces behind different forms of participation?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social capital = shared norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness</p>
<ul>
<li>In-group social processes mobilize participation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Place attachment = a place becomes important because it is imbued with meanings and values that form a bond</p>
<ul>
<li>“Place making” suggests that territory-based identity is also effective in mobilizing neighborhood collective actions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do these forces work together???</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>China is a hard case; the state has provided housing and welfare historically, but dissolution of these protections has allowed for renewed neighborhood autonomy through grassroots organizations like HOAs and commodity housing estates (CHEs)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Understanding neighborhood governance and participation in China</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since late 1980s, Chinese state has provided less and managed less in neighborhoods, leading to altered resident behavior</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Housing privatization</p></li>
<li><p>Diversified neighborhoods (by home type) and intensified residential segregation (between rich &amp; poor) in the urban space</p></li>
<li><p>CHEs built by private developers now the primary form of urban neighborhood; typically, gated communities w/communal spaces and facilities and mixed land use</p>
<ul>
<li>New concept of “collectivity” based on shared properties and home ownership</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Nationwide Community Building campaign launched in 1990s by central gov’t</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CHEs have some autonomy over neighborhood affairs and are managed by HOAs and property management companies (PMCs)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Neighborhood watch</p></li>
<li><p>Amenity maintenance</p></li>
<li><p>Environment upkeep</p>
<ul>
<li>Rise of HOAs not a project of democratization or a move toward an autonomous civil society in China, since they don’t have much power in community governance; however, “it is important to recognize that the nascent grassroots activities in these neighborhoods do seek to achieve the common good for the community, and sometimes even challenge local institutions” (1138-39).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Driving forces of neighborhood participation: social capital vs.&nbsp;place attachment</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Neighborhood participation = a form of civic engagement that stresses voluntary work and activities aiming to influence neighborhood affairs that are of relevance to a collectivity outside the circles of family and close friends</p>
<ul>
<li>Include individual vs.&nbsp;collective, informal vs.&nbsp;formal, political vs.&nbsp;nonpolitical, and cooperative vs.&nbsp;confrontational</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This study looks at 2 forms of civic engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Latent involvement = less active involvement like informal information exchange or subjective involvement like taking an interest in or staying informed about political or societal issues (involved but not engaged)</p></li>
<li><p>Manifest engagement = actions intended to influence actual political outcomes by targeting relevant political or societal elites or organizations</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Modern literature focuses either on the social capital framework or the place attachment framework</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This study combines them!</p></li>
<li><p>Both are necessary to understand neighborhood participation in the Chinese context, but mechanisms vary across neighborhood contexts and demographics</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Urban villages/traditional neighborhoods – less active in social participation and weaker sense of place attachment</p></li>
<li><p>Urban-rural divide in the literature but findings inconclusive</p></li>
<li><p>Other socio-demographics include age, gender, marital status, education, income, years of residence, and home ownership</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Data and methods</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mixed-method approach combining qualitative study and city-wide survey in Guangzhou</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Qualitative study:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3 months of ethnographic fieldwork in 2012 including observations in open spaces and in-depth interviews</p></li>
<li><p>Interviewees selected from communal spaces and snowball sampling used</p></li>
<li><p>25 interviews: 14 men, most homeowners, most have lived in neighborhood 5 years or more, age ranges from 30-60</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Survey:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2012 household survey in Guangzhou used multistage stratified random sampling</p></li>
<li><p>1,809 households in 39 neighborhoods (see Table 1)</p></li>
<li><p>Blha</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Case study results:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Relationships among social capital, neighborhood attachment, and neibhorhood participation not straightforward</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participatory behaviors are contingent on the degree of community social capital (perceived mutual trust and reciprocity among residents) and neighborhood attachment (a sense of home to this neighborhood)</p></li>
<li><p>4 scenarios derived from typology in Table 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Embeddedness = strong community social capital &amp; strong neighborhood attachment</p></li>
<li><p>Anomie = low level of mutual trust among residents but strong attachment to the neighborhood</p></li>
<li><p>Individualism = both weak mutual trust and weak neighborhood attachment</p></li>
<li><p>Volunteerism = high level of community social capital but low neighborhood attachment</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Survey results:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Latent involvement significantly associated with strong neighborhood attachment but not social capital (Model 3, Tables 3 and 4)</p></li>
<li><p>Manifest engagement significantly associated with community social capital, net of effects of neighborhood attachment and private social capital (Model 6)</p></li>

<section id="theory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theory">Theory:</h3>
<p>Why would the internet have an effect on political organization?</p>
<p>“Mirror-Holding” - The internet enables more people to mirror hold. What does this mean?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Internet holds up a mirror for users to better discern and reflect on how their government is actually performing.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>The global nature of the Internet also opens more panoramic windows that better enable individuals to view how governments function in other countries, particularly the high-functioning democracies that tend to be most visible on the Internet. This provides users with a more realistic and globally consistent scale by which to make comparative evaluations about their own government’s performance.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The internet provides more information to citizens, from a broader range of perspectives, than would otherwise be the case-thus improving the capacity of citizens to make more informed evaluations of their governments.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Reminds me a bit of Kevin Munger supply and demand perspective of youtube.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing a venue to publicly document government’s failure or abuses, often coupled with pictures and videos, individuals more readily link their personal experiences to a much larger, pervasive, and entrenched national trend.</p>

<li><p>Why?: 2010 elections were not deemed fully free and fair?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Uchaguzi (an internet platform) allowed people to create a visual map of where election abuses were reported - allowing citizens to view and reflect on it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit of analysis:</strong> Tanzanian individuals&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Subjects were recruited in person at several congregation points in the community of Morogoro. Morgogoro is 120 miles away from the economic capital. 200k population. 200 names were collected. Using random assignment, 70 respondents were given the internet treatment and 70 respondents were given the no-internet control condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subjects were asked to meet at internet cafes. Pre Surveys were given. Individuals then had access to the internet at the cafe for 2 months. Control group was not given internet time but would gain it after the experiment was over. No restrictions were put on how respondents used the internet. After 2 months, respondents were contacted again for a post survey.</p></li>

<section id="results" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results:</h3>

<li><p>Treatment group had less faith in a fair election and believed the recount was less fair.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Users with facebook accounts were more likely to think the election was unfair.</p></li>
<li><p>Treatment was also more likely to trust the police force.</p></li>
<li><p>***Internet users who became more aware of electoral abuses also may have become less likely to believe that their vote mattered as a consequence. While some protested, others simply stayed home.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stones-thoughts">Stone’s Thoughts:</h3>
<p>I love this article! The theory section regarding how the internet influences political behavior is really intuitive. I think I have a good understanding for how the internet influenced all of us and how it culminated into Trump and the polarization across the world. Let me (attempt) to explain my perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For the masses: The internet increased communication and information (duh). As Bailard points out, this changes the cost-benefit analysis for individuals to FORM political opinions. In essence, it becomes easier to engage in politics because it reduces the cost to do so. Information can be obtained so readily and easy that people can engage and it seems Bailard shows this to be the case. As a result, the SUPPLY of voters/individuals interested in politics, increases.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>For elites: The internet provides a new platform for people to engage in politics. Prior to the internet, the barrier to become an elite was much more difficult. The internet democratized who can be an elite. Youtube, facebook, etc. provided a space for anyone to become an elite. This increased the SUPPLY of elites (look at Kevin Munger’s work). The greater supply of elites introduced greater VARIATION in ideology of the elite class (this is how you get polarization to increase as more and more people are expressing different viewpoints). The increased variation of ideology in the elite class spills over into the information and cues they provide to the masses. Because it is easier to be an elite and share information, the masses now have greater access to the variation in perspectives. In short, there used to be a strong barrier towards becoming an elite, perhaps gated by education, money, network, etc; however, the internet basically allows anyone to become an elite and provide cues to people.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>There is a greater SUPPLY of informed voters, SUPPLY of elites, SUPPLY of information and that is what might be driving our polarized epoch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is the source of political trust?</p>
</section>
<section id="purpose-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose-3">Purpose:</h3>
<p>Understanding how trust begins is important for the consolidation of new democracies. There are competing explanations for the sources of political trust. Some hypotheses stress exogenous determinants&nbsp; (these are considered cultural theories) while others stress endogenous determinants (these are considered institutional theories). Both can take micro- and macro-level forms. The authors set out to assess which determinants are stronger.</p>
</section>
<section id="summarytheoryargument-8" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-8">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>(National Culture): Trust in political institutions varies between countries rather than among individuals according to historically rooted, national experiences embedded in interpersonal structure.</p></li>
<li><p>(Individual socialization): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries according to individuals’ trust in others as shaped by their places in the social structure.</p></li>
<li><p>(Government performance): Trust in institutions varies across rather than within countries in proportion to the success of government policies and the character of political institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>(Individual evaluations): Trust in institutions varies within and across countries in accordance with both individuals attitudes and values and the social and economic positions individuals occupy.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="findings-28" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings-28">Findings:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Strongly support the superiority of <strong>institutional explanations (endogenous)</strong> of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>The effects of <strong>macro-political and economic performance</strong> on trust are indirect and mediated at the micro level by an individual’s value-laden perceptions</p></li>
<li><p>Contrary to cultural theories, <strong>interpersonal trust varies</strong> widely within societies and has little appreciable effect on institutional trust at either the aggregate or individual levels</p></li>
<li><p>micro-institutional hypothesis (Hypothesis 4) is confirmed, and the other hypotheses (Hypothesis 1 through Hypothesis 3) are rejected.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Building trust: (p.&nbsp;56)</strong> Trust can be nurtured by improving the conduct and performance of political institutions. Governments can generate public trust the old-fashioned way: They can earn it by responding promptly and effectively to public priorities, rooting out corrupt practices, and protecting new freedoms (Hetherington, 1998, reaches similar conclusions). Political institutions also can earn trust through economic policies that promise and ultimately provide a better material future for the country as a whole.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods-15">Methods:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Data - data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with <strong>survey data</strong> on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Survey data</strong> (p.&nbsp;40) analyzed here come from the fifth New Democracies Barometer (NDB V), organized by the Paul Lazarsfeld Society, Vienna, and the seventh New Russia Barometer (NRB VII), organized by the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NDB interviews were conducted between January 1998 and May 1998 in seven Central and East European countries—Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia—and in two successor states of the former Soviet Union, Belarus and Ukraine.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Professional survey firms conducted face-to-face interviews using national probability samples of approximately 1,000 in each country.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, NRB interviews were conducted in Russia by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion in March 1998 and April 1998 using a multistage national probability sample that yielded 1,904 face-to-face interviews&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To test the effects of both national context and individual differences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pooled the survey data from the 10 countries in a single multinational file of <strong>11,499 respondents.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Each country was weighted equally as <strong>having 1,000 cases</strong>, and a variety of macro-contextual and aggregate performance variables were added to the merged data set so that respondents could be analyzed in terms of both their individual attributes and their national contexts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Institutional trust was measured using the question “There are many different institutions in the country, for example, the government, courts, police, civil servants. Please show me on this 7-point scale, where 1 represents great distrust and 7 represents trust, how much is your personal trust in each of the following institutions?”</p></li>
<li><p>Then were asked “how much do you trust most people you meet?”</p></li>

<li><p>When testing micro theories</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Five proxies for political socialization</strong> are included in the model: age, education, gender, town size, and church attendance.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-5">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Popular trust in political institutions is vital to democracy, but in post-Communist countries, popular distrust for institutions is widespread, and prospects for generating increased political trust are uncertain given disagreements over its origins. Cultural theories emphasizing exogenous determinants of trust compete with institutional theories emphasizing endogenous influences, and both can be further differentiated into micro and macro variants. Competing hypotheses drawn from these theories are tested using data from 10 post-Communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Aggregate data on economic and political performance are combined with survey data on interpersonal and political trust, political socialization experiences, and individual evaluations of national performance. Results strongly support the superiority of institutional explanations of the origins of political trust, especially microlevel explanations, while providing little support for either micro-cultural or macro-cultural explanations. This encourages cautious optimism about the potential for nurturing popular trust in new democratic institutions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Respondents put into 1 of 3 experimental groups and difference of means test conducted on pre- and post-test survey results after respondents watched fictional TV program of political debate with either civil or uncivil exchange:</p>

<li><p>Experiment 1 subjects randomly assigned to civil or uncivil conditions (n = 67)</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 2 included a 3rd control condition where subjects didn’t watch any political TV (n = 155)</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questions-6">Questions:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mutz and Reeves write that “when political actors engage in TV interactions that violate the norms for everyday, face-to-face discourse, they reaffirm viewers’ sense that politicians cannot be counted on to obey the same norms for social behavior by which ordinary citizens abide” (2). Does this work in the opposite direction? If politicians began treating each other respectfully on televised debates, would we expect to see an increase in political trust and that would translate into greater political participation?</p></li>
<li><p>Related to the question above – if we assume that academic literature is the dominant civil medium for research-backed discourse, and that this discourse is important for policy change, institutional stability, and informed public participation in politics, how do we amplify its reach?</p></li>
<li><p>If this study were repeated today, would the results hold? Do we agree that people expect political actors to act civilly toward each other? And if not, is this partly due to the dwindling approval ratings overall of our politicians and our political institutions?</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-notes-10">General Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Television and political trust</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Robinson popularized term “videomalaise” in 1975 to refer to attitudes that resulted from watching television news</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence supporting the causal claim that television is responsible for low levels of political trust has been limited</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims have broadened into general critique of political journalism</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Main emphasis of research has been on the extent to which televised politics heightens the importance of personality characteristics in general evaluations of candidates</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Candidates’ personal qualities more important to voters who obtained political news from TV (Keeter 1987)</p></li>
<li><p>TV primes people to rely more on personality perceptions when evaluating candidates (Druckman 2003)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Social psychology theories of human-media interaction suggest that TV political disagreements would exacerbate the “intensification of feeling” Lippmann described in 1925</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“When political actors engage in TV interactions that violate the norms for everyday, face-to-face discourse, they reaffirm viewers’ sense that politicians cannot be counted on to obey the same norms for social behavior by which ordinary citizens abide” (2)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus of this study is TV b/c it’s the dominant medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Theoretical basis for videomalaise</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To trust = to assume that a person or institution will “observe the rules of the game” (Citrin and Muste 1999)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People expect political actors who appear on television to abide by the same social norms acknowledged by ordinary Americans</p></li>
<li><p>People react negatively to incivility (even if it’s on TV)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Experience of political conflict on TV substantially different from real life</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Need for politeness is particularly great when expressing controversial views (Kingwell 1995)</p></li>
<li><p>Politeness and respect toward individuals involved in a legal conflict enhances their perceptions of fair treatment (Tyler 1990)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Television world provides uniquely intimate perspective on conflicts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When social norms for civility are violated on TV, viewers’ intimate perspective intensifies an already negative reaction to incivility</p></li>
<li><p>Reeves &amp; Nass (1996) show that when motion appears on TV, physiological responses are the same as when motion occurs in the immediate environment – the human brain hasn’t evolved quickly enough to respond in rational ways to technologies such as TV</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When encountering differences of opinion in person, people tend to downplay differences and maintain a polite, cordial atmosphere</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In contrast, TV emphasizes conflict and strong differences of opinion to enhance dramatic value and attract viewers</p></li>
<li><p>TV is also a highly intimate medium</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Central hypothesis: <strong>This violation of social norms should cause negative reactions toward politicians and government</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>People expect others to obey social norms and evaluate them less favorably when they don’t</p></li>
<li><p>Given that the normative expectation is one of civility, this influence should be primarily a function of negative reactions to incivility rather than positive reaction s to civility</p></li>
<li><p>Further hypothesize that <strong>TV viewers will respond negatively to incivility on TV due to largely gut-level, emotional reactions to violations of social norms rather than a cognitive awareness of excessive conflict</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Study Design</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems with validity and reliability of self-reported media exposure (Price &amp; Zaller 1993), so experimental design used</p></li>
<li><p>Central manipulation: the extent to which politicians exchanged political viewpoints in a manner that violates the typical norms governing face-to-face political conflict</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Used adults and undergraduates</p></li>
<li><p>Exposed viewers to systematically different versions of 4 different political disagreements drawn from a larger pool</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Manipulated extent of civility and politeness w/o altering political content</p></li>
<li><p>Expectation that when dissonant views were presented in an uncivil fashion, they would encourage more negative, distrustful attitudes toward politics and politicians</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional actors hired to play roles of 2 congressional candidates with TV studio/political talk show mock program</p></li>
<li><p>Teleprompters used to hep actors adhere closely to a script</p></li>
<li><p>Candidates assigned opposing views on each issue and interaction was to be civl or uncivil</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Experiment 1: free trade, mental health insurance, Internet privacy regulation, and NASA funding</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 2: tobacco regulation, taxation of retail sales on the Internet, public service experience, and free trade</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 3: tobacco regulation, Internet taxes, repeal of the <strong>Glass-Steagall Act</strong>, and public service experience</p>
<ul>
<li>Each edited to 5 min in length</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2 versions of each exchange taped</p>
<ul>
<li>Candidates expressed exactly same position in same words in both versions, offered same arguments, but civil exchanges were VERY civil and uncivil exchanges took personal jabs, raised voices, and never apologized (as well as rude nonverbal reactions)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Figure 1 shows results: candidates in uncivil versions of issue exchanges consistently perceived as less polite, more quarrelsome, more emotional, agitated, and hostile</p>
<ul>
<li>2 null findings: no perceived ideological differences in a candidate’s stand in civil vs.&nbsp;uncivil condition</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Procedures</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participants sat alone in a room w/a comfy couch and overstuffed chair, coffee table, and 32-inch TV</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After consent, they filled out a pretest questionnaire</p></li>
<li><p>Then viewed 20 min of TV program featuring same scripted disagreements on 4 different issues</p></li>
<li><p>Then filled out posttest questionnaire</p>
<ul>
<li>Subjects in experiment #2 not told hypothesis in order to facilitate follow-up interviews by phone</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Experiment 1 subjects randomly assigned to civil or uncivil conditions (n = 67)</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 2 included a 3rd control condition where subjects didn’t watch any political TV (n = 155)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Control group included to determine whether differences between civil and uncivil condition swerve due to an elevation of political trust in the civil condition, a decrease in trust in the uncivil condition, or some combo</p></li>
<li><p>This control group filled out same pre- and posttest questionnaires but watched a non-political program</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Experiment 3 used within-subjects design where all were assigned to both civil and uncivil conditions in random order to understand process of influence</p></li>
<li><p>Political trust measured from National Election Studies under rubric of support for the political system</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Results</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data analyzed by testing difference of mean levels of trust in 2 conditions in experiment 1; all 3 trust measures significantly influenced negatively by uncivil exchange (see Figure 2)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People differentiated between the importance of public conflict and the civility of that conflict</p></li>
<li><p>Uncivil versions perceived to be more entertaining than civil versions</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

In addition, conservative and right-wing people have also been associated with a more intuitive cognitive style in the way they process information (Deppe et al.&nbsp;2015).

<ul>
<li><p>Literature on political sophistication offers 2 competing visions of the electorate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mass public is not well versed in matters of politics</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusions about voters not valid</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Measurement strategies/instruments not good</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusions of first view overlook useful info voters do have and use</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Authors agree with 2nd view and seek to operationalize definition of sophistication</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual levels of sophistication are the product of choices driven by a contextual incentive structure</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Classic view: Converse (1964) – voter opinions not ideologically constrained across time or issues; this is basically stating that voters don’t understand politics</p>
<ul>
<li>Citizens can’t hold reps accountable if they don’t understand the system</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>More generous view rejects this</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Measures used to estimate level of info and integration crude and unreliable (Achen 1975; Erikson 1979; Luskin 1987)</p></li>
<li><p>Measures systematically underestimate levels of info and cognitive capacity among citizens (Nie &amp; Andersen 1974)</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals may not be politically sophisticated but democracy is safe b/c sophistication is a “collective phenomenon” (Feld &amp; Grofman 1988)</p></li>
<li><p>Collective public opinion measures stable and consistent (Page &amp; Shapiro 1992; Stimson 1991)</p></li>
<li><p>Even in absence of high levels of info, voters may successfully use scant amounts of info to develop specific issue positions; they can take cues from</p>
<ul>
<li><p>affective orientation toward relevant actors (Brady &amp; Sniderman 1985)</p></li>
<li><p>Political environment (Zaller 1992)</p></li>
<li><p>General orientations toward politics or specific issue areas (Feldman 1988 &amp; 1989; Peffley &amp; Hurwitz 1993)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Individuals understand issues that are personally salient (Neuman 1986)</p></li>
<li><p>Recognized difference in stability and consistency between opinion on ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ issues (Carmines &amp; Stimson 1989)</p>
<ul>
<li>“While many citizens lack extensive political information, ‘assessing voters by civics exams misses the many things that voters do know, and the many ways they can do without the facts that the civics tradition assumes they should know’ (Popkin 1991, 20; emphasis in the original)” (128).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Public’s performance on measures of sophistication not sufficient to illustrate political capabilities</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shortcomings may be the product of systems – and individual choices structured by those systems</p></li>
<li><p>Current 3 components to measure sophistication:</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Means (cognitive capacity)</p></li>
<li><p>Motive (incentives toward collecting and using accurate political info)</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity (availability of aforementioned info)</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>How do we measure this accurately then?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Capabilities</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Smart people can and do have more info and more accurate info</p></li>
<li><p>Individual-level characteristics have an effect on sophistication</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Education</p></li>
<li><p>Income</p></li>
<li><p>Occupational status</p></li>
<li><p>Media usage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These variables may be the best proxies to control for different dimensions of individual capabilities</p></li>
<li><p>The more highly educated may have been indoctrinated into the standard belief system/dominant social ideology</p></li>
<li><p>Being at a higher ed or socioeconomic status may reduce costs of collecting political info</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Choices</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As opportunities to get info become more scarce, motivation to get it must increase; thus, several factors will structure these choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Party system</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Individuals in multiparty system would be more motivated to collect info b/c opportunity to do so is greater</p></li>
<li><p>Downs’ (1957) median voter theorem tells us parties will try to differentiate themselves from each other to mobilize support – increasing available info</p></li>
<li><p>This effect declines as number of parties get significantly higher</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Electoral system</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nationally competitive elections will increase political sophistication by increasing motivation</p></li>
<li><p>Parliamentary societies lower cost of political info b/c parties’ positions are stable</p></li>
<li><p>Compulsory voting increases turnout and may increase sophistication</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-6">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Political leaders across Africa frequently accuse the media of promoting homosexuality, while activists often use the media to promote pro-LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) narratives. Despite extensive research on how the media affects public opinion, including studies that show how exposure to certain information can increase support of LGBTQs, there is virtually no research on how the media influences attitudes towards LGBTQs across Africa. This study develops a theory that accounts for actors’ mixed approach to the media and shows how different types of media create distinct effects on public opinion of LGBTQs. Specifically, the study finds that radio and television have no, or a negative, significant effect on pro-gay attitudes, whereas individuals who consume more newspapers, internet or social media are significantly more likely to support LGBTQs (by approximately 2 to 4 per cent). The author argues that these differential effects are conditional on censorship of queer representation from certain mediums. The analysis confirms that the results are not driven by selection effects, and that the relationship is unique to LGBTQ support but not other social attitudes. The results have important implications, especially given the growing politicization of same-sex relations and changing media consumption habits across Africa.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Authors seek to understand relationship between voter turnout, macroeconomic conditions, and support for political parties w/explicit appeals to working class/disadvantaged in developing democracies</p>
<ul>
<li><p>WCED parties&nbsp; = political parties for working class/economically disadvantaged</p></li>
<li><p>A number of does support idea that economy affects voter turnout in the developing world (Pacek &amp; Radcliff, 1995b; Radcliff, 1992)&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Turnout and party support</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Higher levels of turnout benefit left parties electorally in advanced industrial nations (Crewe 1981)</p></li>
<li><p>Lower status/economically disadvantaged citizens who are the traditional left party constituents vote at lower and more variable rates tan their better-off counterparts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower status voters more marginal or “peripheral” b/c there’s a lower probability that they’ll vote – varies each election</p>
<ul>
<li>Left parties should demonstrate varying support as turnout fluctuates</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“Class bias” in voter turnout = ratio of lower-class to upper-class voters participating; considerable class bias exists in their sample of countries. “Few studies outside the United States have examined the extent to which this measure may vary across time and why. A simple correlation between class bias scores and voter turnout for the same years across a sample of developing countries produces a score of –.78; higher class bias scores, indicating a greater discrepancy between upper-class and lower-class voting, are associated with lower levels of turnout” (997-998, emphasis mine).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cross-national studies on this concept have lagged</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pacek and Radcliff’s 1995c cross-national study of elections in 19 industrial democracies from 1950-1990 found that left parties’ share of the vote increased by almost one third of a percentage point for every percentage point increase in turnout</p></li>
<li><p>Alford Indices measure class voting from national surveys</p>
<ul>
<li>“If [disadvantaged/working] classes tend to support the spectrum of parties with specific appeals toward them and generally vote less than those who are better off, then such parties should benefit from increases in turnout in a manner similar to the effect in advanced industrial societies” (999).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Selection criteria for WCED parties:</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Examine class composition of political party specrum where survey data on party choice are available for an indication of which parties appeal primarily to the working and economically disadvantaged classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine the programmatic appeals and policy orientation of party types from various editions of Political Parties of the World and the Political Handbook of the World as well as individual website for political parties in countries where they focus.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Riker continues this - change it to “citizens duty”&nbsp;</li>

<li><p>Adding a D term is the same as subtracting a C term.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More of a sense of citizen duty can counter the cost of voting.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>D does not change anything unless D &gt; C.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>CRITICAL INNOVATION TO CALCULUS OF VOTING MODEL:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each person assigns a probability of the state of the world being true.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The probability that one vote will make a difference.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Can be summed up through the equation:&nbsp;</p>

<li><p>B = difference in utility for candidate A instead of B winning (diff in benefits)&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>D = citizen duty</p></li>
<li><p>C = cost of voting&nbsp;</p></li>

<li>Rat choices are models of how one acts, given tastes. They are not models of where “taste” comes from.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Developed by Ferejohn and Fiorina&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Reject completing the basic model.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They argue people’s ability to form probability assessments of the state of the world is basically too difficult and near impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If these probability assessments cannot be formed, they argue that the calculus of the voting model can not be used.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Instead of expected utility maximization, they propose a decision rule called minimax regret</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Suppose a voter decided to abstain. Their preferred candidate loses by one vote. That voter would be regretful of their decision.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus they measure the level of regret&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minimax regret refers to taking the action that yields the minimum of these maximum regrets.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>This model differs in what to do on the middle columns as seen in figure 1.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>They argue their model is better than the calculus model and better predicts turnout more often.</p></li>
<li><p>Problems with the Minimax Regret Model:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>P term is still an issue&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>P at least exist but is small&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Honestly this was a bit over my head. See page 259 - was confused.&nbsp;</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outcome-1">Outcome:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Patterns and Trends: A total of 533 elections and 106 countries are included. All democratic legislative elections (1972-2004), mean turnout 75% and stable with variation in the 3 points range. Variation in country is around 5 points. No central tendency. Turnout decline over time of 8 to 9 points. Higher in established democracies (29 countries) and slightly higher in presidential elections.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Explaining Turnout Variations across Countries: Three sets of factors have been identified: the socioeconomic environment, the institutional set-up, and the party system (Powell 1982; Blais and Dobrzynska 1998). Difference between poor and other countries (undistinguishable amongst the wealthy). Compulsory system affect turnout with a 10-15 points higher turnout (not sure if it is about the sanctions). PR and high magnitude, higher turnout /= in Latin America. Important elections and relative power of the seat at stake=higher turnout/ with a caveat (Blais 2000). Higher leverage of lower house predicts best higher turnout. Facility of voting does not produce measurable findings. Turnout appears to be higher when there are less parties in contention. “Closeness” of the results might have an effect. No real consensus on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Explaining the Recent Turnout Decline: three reasons for the 9 points decline since 1990 1) Generational replacement, Degree of competition of the election (Franklin). + voting age lowering is not a culprit , 2) Fractionalization in party system, 3)declining group mobilization (especially where union density has subsided). Not completely set</p></li>
<li><p>The Decision to Vote or not to Vote: age and education are the two most significant factors, followed by religiosity, income, and marital status (Blais 2000).</p></li>

<p>Following the ideational approach, this study claims that populists aim to facilitate the moralistic separation between the pure people (us) and the corrupt elite (them). While constituting the boundaries of us vs.&nbsp;them, populists create an in-group vs.&nbsp;out-group identity. To this end, one of the primary tools that populists utilize is collective nostalgia. Populists offer their constituencies a golden age – a heartland where corruption, disruptions and enemies do not exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elçi situates populism and collective nostalgia in the context of Turkey, where contemporary secularist and Islamic cleavages exist as a product of structures established under the Ottoman Empire. The cleavage exemplifies the ruling center (secularist elites) and the ruled periphery (the Islamic people).&nbsp; The ruling center adopted Kemalist beliefs - pushing the country to modernize, become secular, and overall promote nationalism. This push was the result of the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990’s, leaving a power vacuum in the region that was filled by the Kurds . In response to this, political Islam is aggrandizing the Ottoman past as a tool for the reconstruction of “<strong>the Great Turkey</strong>” today. In this way, they are experiencing Ottoman nostalgia - a desire to return to “the golden days” and become a leader of the Islamic world.&nbsp; Ottoman nostalgia is much older than Kemalist nostalgia - which began to emerge in the 1990’s following increased pressure by the EU to privatize, as well as increased exposure to the IMF and World bank, which challenged the existing values of the Kemalists. This nostalgia is characterized by ‘the memory of a strong, independent, self-sufficient state and its secularist modernization politics which dominated the public sphere through the past century’.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-notes-14">General Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Turkey’s populist Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) exploits nostalgic rhetoric to dominate the country’s politics.</p>
<ul>
<li>emphasize the glorious days of the Ottoman and Seljukian empires</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Populists frequently emphasize that the elites hijacked the people’s will long ago, and they promise to return power to the people.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>According to this logic, back in the good old days corrupt elites were not powerful enough to abuse the authentic people.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>According to populists, the people’s will is the cornerstone of politics&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Many scholars agree that populism appears as a backlash to a sense of severe crisis (Rooduijn 2014; Taggart 2004) or discontent (Spruyt, Keppens and Van Droogenbroeck 2016).&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This sense of extreme crisis paves the way for raising concerns about the present conditions, which is a breeding ground for populism (Akkerman, Mudde and Zaslove 2014).&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Populists blame the establishment for the decline in the people’s economic, political and living standards (Rooduijn, van der Brug and de Lange 2017).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Populism can also be generated by unsolved, long-lasting and cross-cutting political cleavages within a society. Somer and McCoy (2019, 8) define these cleavages as formative rifts that ’either emerged or could not be resolved during the formation of nation-states, or, sometimes during fundamental re-formulations of states such as during transitions from communism to capitalism, or authoritarian to democratic regime</p></li>
<li><p>Nostalgia is a yearning for the past&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>According to Strauth and Turner (1988) it has four component parts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, ‘there is the view of history as decline and loss, being a departure from some golden age of “homefulness”’.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Second,&nbsp; is the problem that there exists ‘a sense of the loss of wholeness and moral certainty’.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>At this point, ‘history is seen to be a collapse of values which had once provided the unity of social relations and personal experience’.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The third is related to ‘the loss of individual autonomy and the collapse of genuine social relationships’.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Last but not least, nostalgia is ‘the sense of a loss of simplicity, spontaneity, and authenticity’</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Nostalgia, or the way we remember our past, <strong>exacerbates in-group vs.&nbsp;out-group distinctions</strong> (Martinovic et al.&nbsp;2018).&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Nostalgia also <strong>strengthens shared social identity and distinguishes the in-group from other groups</strong> (Brown and Humphreys 2002; Wildschut et al.&nbsp;2014).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The rise of populism is closely related to ‘acute despair at the present moment and a memory of a previous golden age’.</p></li>
<li><p>The golden age corresponds to the heartland in populist literature.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Coined by Taggart (2004, 278), ‘the heartland is a construction of the good life derived retrospectively from a romanticized conception of life as it has been lived’.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>It involves returning to the pre-lapsarian world, a Golden age before a catastrophic lapse or fall: in the post-lapsarian era, individuals feel lacking, deficient or oppressed (Tannock 1995).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In Turkey, secularists and Islamist cleavages exist</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The secularists can be thought of as the elites and appear to be supported by the left</p>
<ul>
<li>they have dominated Turkish politics and society as guardians of the Kemalist values</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>&nbsp;The Islamist’s are the people, representing the ruled and appear to be supported by the right (Çarkoğlu 2012; Çarkoğlu and Hinich 2006).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Expectations that impacted Control variable selection:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The author expects that the more dissatisfied respondents are with their lives in general, subjective economic conditions and democracy, the more populist attitudes they will have.</p></li>
<li><p>Religiosity plays a pivotal role in explaining the party preferences of the Turkish constituency and is a key independent variable for explaining the center–periphery cleavage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore expects more religious respondents to display more populist attitudes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Expect Alevi respondents to have less populist attitudes because they are more supportive of secularism.</p></li>
<li><p>Expects that Kurdish respondents will have more populist attitudes because they are more critical of the Kemalist establishment.</p></li>
<li><p>The Peoples’ Democratic Party (Halkların Demokratik Partisi, HDP), as a radical democratic pro-Kurdish party, should also display more populist attitudes</p></li>
<li><p>expect CHP and Nationalist Action Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, MHP) voters to have less populist attitudes since they represent the status quo.</p></li>

<li><p>“Straddling the individual-aggregate divide are accounts informed by theorist of social capital; the argument is that individuals who invest in social capital (through the participation in civil society) and those communities rich in social capital will not find the radical right particularly appealing” (Coffe et al.&nbsp;2007)&nbsp;</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>So like if you have good thoughts about your communities you will vote far right but if you’re very involved with community you won’t</p></li>
<li><p>Having very positive sentiment toward the locality and the people in it can make the radical right appealing.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, route engagement in community life wards off the appeals of these parties; when people invest their time and energy into participating in civil society and neighborhood life, the radical right is not so enticing an option.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover it is feelings of attachment not the actual routine social interaction that benefits radical right parties.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When people avoid routine social and organizational activity, but still feel very positively tied to their local communities, they are powerfully primed to consider radical right programs alluring.&nbsp;</p></li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To overcome conceptual confusion and regional isolation, this article investigates whether populism is exclusive or inclusive (or both) cross-regionally and by consistently using one definition of populism</p>
<ul>
<li><p>4 case studies 1990-2010: Haider and Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), Le Pen and French National Front (FN), Morales and Bolivian Movement for Socialism (MAS), and Chávez and United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV)</p></li>
<li><p>3 dimensions of inclusion/exclusion: material, symbolic, and political</p>
<ul>
<li>2 factors crucial to understanding regional patterns:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The way populist actors define who belongs to ‘the people’ vis-à-vis ‘the elite’</p></li>
<li><p>The ideological features attached to the particular populist ideology of the actors</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>BOTH share a problematic relationship w/liberal democracy</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Populism defined:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Minimalist definition of <strong>populism</strong>: a thin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogenous and antagonistic groups, “the pure people” versus “the corrupt elite”, and which argues that politics should be an expression of the general will of the people.</p></li>
<li><p>Key elements of the concept:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Theoretical and empirical perspective</p></li>
<li><p>Thin-centered ideology =&nbsp; a particular set of ideas that is limited in ambition and scope; highly context-dependent</p></li>
<li><p>3 core concepts:</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The pure people</p></li>
<li><p>The corrupt elite</p></li>
<li><p>The general will</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Carries idea that all individuals of a given community are able to unify their wills with the aim of proclaiming popular sovereignty as the only legitimate source of political power</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages of the concept:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good concept-building characterized by presenting a definition based on necessary and sufficient conditions and identifying its negative pole: elitism and pluralism</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Elitism = the people are dishonest and vulgar while the elite are superior in cultural, intellectual, and moral terms</p></li>
<li><p>Pluralism = societies are composed of several social groups with different ideas and interests; favors many centers of powers and maintains that politics should reflect the preferences of as many groups as possible through compromise and consensus</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Populism has a ‘chameleon character’ – it can be left-wing or right-wing, organized in top-down or bottom-up fashion, rely on strong leaders or even be leaderless</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thus, subtypes of populism should be the starting point for analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Since populism is an ideology rather than a political strategy, it is linked to both supply-side and demand-side factors</p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Focus is on both leaders and parties</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Inclusion vs.&nbsp;Exclusion?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Framework comes from recent (2010) study of the political right in Israel&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Material Dimension – distribution of state resources, both monetary and non-monetary, to specific groups in society</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exclusion – groups specifically excluded from access to state resources (jobs or welfare)</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion – groups specifically targeted to receive (more) state resources, sometimes to overcome long-established discrimination</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Latin America: Chávez and Morales have pushed policies to promote quality of life improvements for weak socioeconomic groups</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social missions (misiones sociales)&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Health care programs, expansion of primary education, distribution of subsidized food and housing provision services</p></li>
<li><p>Morales – cash transfer programs to school-aged children and improvement of old age pension</p></li>
<li><p>Financed by gas an oil and new political economy of development</p></li>
<li><p>Exclusion of economic establishment</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Europe: richer than LA, therefore instead of establishing welfare state they are focused on protecting it from outside forces (notably immigrants); focus in on exclusion of outgroups</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Welfare chauvinism – fairly generous welfare state generally supported for the ‘own people’ but not for ‘aliens’ (immigrants, refugees, or Roma)</p></li>
<li><p>Français d’abord (French first)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Political Dimension – refers to political participation and public contestation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exclusion – specific groups prevented from participating (fully) in the democratic system</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion – specifically targets certain groups to increase their participation and representation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LA: radical democracy (or revolutionary or real); criticize elitist character of LA democracies and plead for broader political participation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strengthening the ‘voice of the voiceless’</p></li>
<li><p>Venezuelan PSUV promotes formation of a protagonist and participatory democracy based on plebiscitary mechanisms and communal councils</p></li>
<li><p>Bolivarian Circles (’círculos bolivarianos) = groups of 8-10 people seeking to engage in consciousness raising and community projects at the grassroots level</p></li>
<li><p>Bolivian MAS supports new constitution aimed at political participation through direct democratic channels</p></li>
<li><p>Ideology of Americanismo is an important element in defense of the model of radical democracy and in the attack on ‘foreign’ forms of political rule</p></li>
<li><p>Political participation has increased but rules of public contestation have been undermined</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Europe: want democracy to be more responsive to natives and promote exclusion of non-natives</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Populist parties attract higher levels of blue-collar workers</p></li>
<li><p>More young and new reps</p></li>
<li><p>Vehemently oppose extending political rights to ‘aliens’</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Symbolic Dimension – least tangible; alludes to setting the boundaries of ‘the people’ and, ex negativo, ‘the elite’</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“When populists define ‘the people,’ in their rhetoric and symbols without referring to (characteristics and values of) certain groups, the latter are symbolically excluded (for example, Roma in Eastern Europe)” (164).</p></li>
<li><p>When groups are linked to the elite they are explicitly excluded from ‘the people’</p></li>

<p>Gender values and cultural backlash (Norris and Inglehart, 2019 = generational change; Burns and Gallagher, 2010; Spierings, 2020), cultural backlash other issues: immigration + novelty of progressive gender values with anti-immigration (Lancaster, 2022) -&gt; countering Muslim immigration. Issue salience = when does the backlash occurs (Adams, 1997; Dahlstrom and Esaiasson, 2013; Wojcieszak, 2018; Bishin, 2016; Belanger and Meguid, 2008; Dennison, 2020),</p>

<p>A first difference correlational (not causal) analysis of the 2014 and 2018 Sweden elections. Conditional argument placing issue salience, such as liberal gender values, and resulting backlash as a right-wing extremism vote predictor. Difference in exit poles concerning the issue, gender-related Google searches (with Google trends analysis). Using the SNES for survey questions on gender issues and voting preference.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hypothesis-21">Hypothesis:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Gender value gap increases between PRR voters and other voters when gender issues are salient = gender attitudes indicators (y) ~ voting for SD (X1) * year dummy (X2)</p></li>
<li><p>Conservative gender values are positively related to PRR voting when gender issues are salient = voting for SD (y) ~ on gender attitudes indicators (Xs)/Logistic regression</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mechanism-3">Mechanism:</h3>
<p>Issue salience triggers a cultural backlash: provide more information for the individual on the issue and will provoke a certain type of vote.</p>

<section id="findings-39" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings-39">Findings:</h3>
<p>Having conservative attitudes towards gender issues predicted a 20% probability to vote for SD (more than doubling the prediction between 2014-2018)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>SD voters hold consistently less progressive views on gender issues</p></li>
<li><p>This trend increase d between 2014 and 2018 (relating to salience)/ Other voters went the other direction and increased support for progressive measures</p></li>
<li><p>Gap increased more for power distribution than LGBTQ questions</p></li>
