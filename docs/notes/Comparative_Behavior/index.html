<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="anderson-christopher-j.-2009.-interaction-of-structures-and-voter-behavior.-ohpb-ch.-31-589-609.">Anderson, Christopher J. 2009. “Interaction of Structures and Voter Behavior.” <em>OHPB</em> CH. 31: 589-609.</h2>
<p><strong>Bumper Sticker: Rules &amp; context influence and are influenced by behaviour!</strong> (British spelling)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This article discusses and reviews the growing literature on the nexus of macro-level structures and individual behaviour that some studies are a part of. It looks at the effects that macro-level institutions and contexts have on citizen behaviour, along with how political institutions and the environment where citizens form opinions and act, help in moderating the effects of individual-level factors on citizen behaviour. The modelling structures and behaviour, effects of structures on voter behaviour, and the interactions of structures and behaviour in research on economic voting are some of the topics covered in the article.</p>
<p><strong>Outline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Does x cause behaviour y? It depends!</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Example: Does institutional performance affect people’s sense of whether their political system is legitimate?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer: The impact of corruption on system support is conditional on whether citizens are supporters of the incumbent government.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Studies are getting better at using institutions and context to predict the effects of citizen behaviour.</strong></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Comparative study of structures and behaviour = citizens in context&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Context and behaviour intimately connected by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Formal and informal rules; people’s preferences, attitudes, and behaviour affect the establishment and functioning of rules</li>
<li>Citizens are exposed to variable social, political, and economic environments that they are supposed to understand, interpret, and sometimes shape</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Advances in surveys, replication, and computing have allowed for cross-national and multi-level research into behaviour</p></li>
<li><p>1980s and 1990s renewed focus on institutional questions across polysci that could be tested, as well as interest in developing contextual theories of political behaviour</p></li>
<li><p>Comparative study of behaviour politics has investigated macro-level contexts/structures:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Institutions</p></li>
<li><p>Structural conditions</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Interaction between structures and behaviour presumes several things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Politics is about the interaction of people’s values and the rules and conditions that govern the implementation of those values</li>
<li>The rules and realities in which citizens make choices are themselves a function of people’s values
<ul>
<li>“Put another way: contexts are critical for understanding the decisions people make because they affect different people differently, and people’s decisions, in turn, shape the nature, shape, and stability of these contexts” (678).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Common approach assumes that context shapes behaviour; assumes behaviour to be DV and that it is exogenous and stable</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Do institutions have direct effects on behaviour?</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting example: structures can affect voters directly, indirectly, and interactively (or contingently)
<ul>
<li>Direct: rational choice theory; individuals weigh costs and benefits of voting and act accordingly</li>
<li>Indirect: behaviours of elites within electoral rules empower or constrain citizen choices; structures have consequences but these consequences have secondary (or indirect) effects on behaviour</li>
<li>Contingent: effect of some structural feature strengthened or weakened, depending on presence of some 3rd variable; the turnout gap between individuals with many and few resources is particularly pronounced in countries where the cost of voting is high</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>{INSERT PHOTO HERE}</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent studies have looked at how the nature of a country’s representative structures interacts with the willingness of voters to punish governments for bad economic performance
<ol type="1">
<li>Bad economy impact hinges on ability of voters to hold gov’t responsible</li>
<li>Institutions can hamper this ability of voters to reward or punish gov’ts</li>
<li>Clarity of responsibility also varies over time within (and across) countries b/c of election outcomes that change bargaining power and reshape context</li>
<li>Also contingent upon credible alternatives for voters to vote into office</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Interactions of vote choice and structures in research on legitimacy
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What role do institutions play in moderating sense of loss or victory citizens feel?</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions shape the responses of winners and losers; citizen attitudes toward democratic institutions shaped by country’s political context</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>“At the end of the day, what is particularly noteworthy about cross-level investigations of behavioural politics is that they hold the promise of producing a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of political life by connected hitherto unconnected streams of scholarship in the areas of institutions, political economy, policy, and behaviour and allowing us a better and more complex empirical and theoretical handle on the hows and whys of citizen politics” (690).</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="puzzle"><strong>PUZZLE</strong>:</h3>
<p>The intellectual left has a hard time reconciling the normative position of a&nbsp; “proletarian” revolution as a necessary progressive force and the evidence of a “totalitarian degeneration of Communism” (quoting “The Choice of Comrades,”Encounter, 3 (December 1954), p.&nbsp;25. Arnold A. Rogow, cited p.482).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="key-argument" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-argument">KEY ARGUMENT:</h3>
<p>Following evidence and psychological research on personality traits of&nbsp; different society’s strata, Lipset posits that the lower strata are predisposed to support&nbsp; authoritarianism due to a lack of “sophistication” and facing economic and psychological&nbsp; insecurity. The lower class will support economic liberalism but not political liberalism, while the&nbsp; middle and upper class will support political liberalism. Hence, according to Lipset, there is a&nbsp; natural link between the lower-class attitudes and their support of Communism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Pre-1914: working-class supported both economic and political liberalism&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Post-1914: “The intransigent, intolerant, and demonological aspects of Communist ideology attract members from the lower class of low-income, low-status occupations, and little education” (483).</p>

<p>• “Leftism/economic liberalism associated with socio-economic status” (485). • “Psychologically oriented investigators have studied the social correlates of authoritarian&nbsp; personality structures as measured by the now famous F scale”(Adorno, 1950, cited p.&nbsp; 486).&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Even in conservatism, economic status predicts tolerance levels (see Eysenck, 1956 and&nbsp; Stouffer, 1955, cited p.486)</p>

<li><p>When the Communist Party (or Socialist in some cases) is a mass party, it tends to be more&nbsp; authoritarian (or less committed to democratic values) because it has <strong>stripped its&nbsp; intellectual leadership</strong>.</p></li>

<p><strong>HISTORICAL PATTERNS AND DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Historically, the left has been responsible for democratization; intellectual leadership still&nbsp; supports democratic values, but the masses of the lower strata do not understand the&nbsp; implications of the left beyond economic value to them.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Conservatism is vulnerable in democracy for demographic reasons (500). • Neither conservatism nor the authoritarian predisposition of the lower class should be seen&nbsp; as a threat to democracy.&nbsp;</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This chapter offers an intellectual history of the critical texts that defined the research orientation of political behavior. Is focuses on how traditional theories from sociology and psychology informed our understanding of political behaviors through interactions with primary groups. However, along the way, the political science discipline that studied behavior began undergoing changes to the way behavioral study was approached - emphasizing, instead, individual level survey research and a reconceptualization of social logic. Fortunately, social logic is back on the mend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>particularly influential were Lazarsfeld, Katz, Berelson, Gaudet, and McPhee Electoral Sociology was where the onset of the behavioral revolution in political science first observed electoral choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting is a reflection of our behavior - of our conversations with other people and the attitudes we shape through those interactions&nbsp;</p>
<p>By this logic, we vote based on how the relationships we have shape us This is counter to theories of voting as a rational act&nbsp;</p>

This question has also been approached with similar results by Lipmann (1922), “Public Opinion” and Schumpeter (1950), “Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy” (see&nbsp; also Bennett, 2006, “Democratic Competence, Before Converse and After”).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Converse stipulates that the degree of coherence of the mass public belief system is contingent on the level of constraints of the idea-elements populating a belief system: the more constrained, the&nbsp; more coherent. This, in turn, predicts a degree of capacity to participate in democracy according&nbsp; to one’s self-assessed ideological placement. Idea-elements are mainly constrained by the&nbsp; transmission of information and its digestibility. For this reason, Converse finds that 15% of the&nbsp; population is deemed ideologue or near-ideologue (possessing a coherent belief system = elite political actors). In contrast, the remaining 85% (the masses) float between having a particular&nbsp; interest (issue public) or having no idea. <strong>If ideology is not driving most of the public’s opinion&nbsp; incentive, what is?</strong> Converse suggests that “visible” social groupings serve as a stable heuristic&nbsp; informing public opinion: party ID (.70) has more bearing than policies, but policies concerning&nbsp; visible groups (school desegregation .45) have more bearing than regular policies (government and housing .28). This “ideology by proxy” might produce idiosyncratic outcomes as well: the&nbsp; working man associating with Socialists against the rich but against government reigning of private&nbsp; enterprise’s provision of public goods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article presents a survey and interpretation of the contributions made by #network #theories on the study of citizens and democratic policies. The article serves as an overview of the topic. It begins by locating the network research within the rich substantive and theoretical tradition of individually and #group-based studies of #electoral #politics and #public #opinion . It addresses some methodological issues in the study of political information #networks. The article ends with the discussion of theoretical and substantive insights that were generated in several studies, such as the study of communication and persuasion among citizens.</p>

<p>The author sets out to analyze the contribution of network theories, which have provided us the ability to analyze citizen and democratic politics from across the micro-macro spectrum. Network theories draw on the importance of groups, communities, and political information networks among and between individuals (Downs 1957) while incorporating a conceptual apparatus that extends far past the traditional notions of primary groups, organizations, and societal groups in order to define the relationships that exist among individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Despite its advantages, there are still some methodological issues with network analysis.</p>

<li><p>Network studies are particularly useful in analyzing well defined populations - such as clergies, political elites, court, and legislatures.</p>

<p>The authors argue that the endorsement of authoritarian policies can be explained by the theory of affective intelligence.

<ul>
<li><p><strong>H1:</strong> increased anger will enhance decision making based on past dispositional convictions, leading to increased polarization between left and right wing individuals (strengthen authoritarian tendencies for right-wing and weaken those same tendencies for the right)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>H2:</strong> increased anxiety will initiate decision-making that is less reliant on extant convictions and hence make those on the left end of the left-right scale more attentive and responsive to calls from the right to adopt authoritarian policies.</p></li>

<section id="summary-of-theoryargument" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-theoryargument">Summary of Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>The authors postulate what they call a theory of affect-driven motivated reasoning in trying to explain when and why citizens actively process biased information. This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being “motivated- skepticals” when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e.&nbsp;spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of “partisan processing” that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:</p>
<p><strong>H1:</strong> there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs</p>
<p><strong>H2:</strong> there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments</p>
<p><strong>H3:</strong> there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones</p>
<p><strong>These combined will results in:</strong></p>
<p><strong>H4:</strong> attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments</p>
<p><strong>Which is conditional upon:</strong></p>
<p><strong>H5:</strong> the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism</p>
<p><strong>H6:</strong> and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.</p>

<section id="summarytheoryargument-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-1">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>Most national election studies tend to rely on a single measure of partisanship. Such measurements tend to vary in terms of how they are phrased on surveys and also struggle to capture the range of partisan identity, typically at the low and high ends of the spectrum. The authors believe that they can develop a multi-item scale of partisan identity that better predicts political behavior ACROSS various multiparty democracies than the traditional single item scales common on surveys.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="partisan-identity-scale">Partisan Identity Scale</h4>
<p>Creates an Eight-Item Scale of Partisanship that is derived from Social Identity Theory Derives three (3) hypothesis to test whether the scale is better than traditional models: <strong>H1</strong>: The Partisan Identity Scale should differentiate equally well among low, middling, and high levels of identity to best uncover the link between identity and political activity across its full range. Expect each scale item to provide more complete information about partisan strength than the traditional single party identification item.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of the IRT analysis, this means that each item’s information function will be more peaked and contain greater information than the standard single measure of partisan strength. In the three European multi-party systems under study, we expect both lower and higher levels of partisan intensity to remain less well detected when measured with the traditional item</p>
<p><strong>H2:</strong> the partisan identity scale to exhibit all three types of invariance, which means that the fit of the metric invariance model will be no worse than the fit of the configural model, and that the fit of the scalar model will be no worse than that of the metric model.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>H3:</strong> The partisan identity scale should more powerfully predict in-party voting and political engagement than the traditional party identification item. We also expect the partisan identity scale to better predict political behavior than a multi-item indicator of ideological intensity&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods-1">Methods:</h3>
<p>the methods are pretty complex, but essentially each hypothesis undergoes a different set of tests/inquiry.&nbsp;<br>
<strong>H1</strong> - figure 1 shows how the 8 item scale that the authors derived is better measure of latent partisan strength than the individual measures in each country. This is also event in the peaks that you can see in each figure. They are more much more sensitive to to the full range of the low- high spectrum. <strong>H2</strong> - invariance is measured using R software to perform multi-group confirmatory analysis (CFA) Configural invariance is a good fit&nbsp;</p>

<section id="summarytheoryargument-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-2">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>Keele and Wolak seek to explain why some people are more prone to #partisan “instability” (or “volatility”) than others. To the authors, the reason for this has to do with the “hierarchy of values”. When people have obvious values that rank higher than others (humanitarianism, egalitarianism, equality) AND these #values align with political elites values, then partisan identity remains a steady tool with which to measure the political world against. HOWEVER, for some people, the values rank similarly and therefore cause conflicting #preferences that individuals struggle to resolve. Competing values will produce #volatility in partisan opinions specifically when individuals endorse values that cross the fault lines of partisan dialogue&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value conflict will disrupt partisan stability when an individuals value organization is non-ideological - i.e.&nbsp;it doesn’t quite fit the rhetoric or portrayal by the liberal vs.&nbsp;conservative, left-right spectrum. what makes it non-ideological is that you support values on BOTH sides&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those that have values the match political elites leads to stable partisanship&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those that have internalized value organization that doesn’t match elites leads to conflicts of values and partisan volatility.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-2">Abstract:</h3>
<p>Many students of British voting patterns have tested for the existence of contextual effects, which postulate that voters are influenced by events and people in their local milieux. One of those contextual effects is the neighborhood effect, whereby individuals are influenced by the nature of the politically relevant information circulating within their social networks, many of which are spatiallyconstrained to their local area. Although ecological analyses have identified patterns consistent with this hypothesis, there have been virtually no direct investigations of the effect, largely because of the absence of relevant data. Using information from a large, clustered survey of voters at the time of the 1992 general election, this paper uncovers clear evidence of such effects: people are much more likely to change their votes in a particular direction if those with whom they discuss political issues support that direction, especially if they are members of the respondent’s family and are the individuals with whom they discuss politics most.</p>

<p>Does the neighborhood effect have an impact on voter decisions?</p>
</section>
<section id="summarytheoryargument-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-3">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>Most researchers have accepted that voters are influence by their immediate social and geographical environments as well as their own individual circumstances. However, the way in which such contextual factors operate is contested. Most explanations point to spatial variation in economic and political contexts and the driving force behind voter’s decisions. That is, “nonsocial” context on economic and political conditions at the local and national level compose the voting repertoire with which individuals draw on at the polls.</p>
<p>However, the authors speculate that the influence of immediate social networks (family, friends, colleagues) on individual opinions informs their voting behavior. Early research explored such possibilities, but scarcity of data left this “neighborhood effect” to be abandoned if favor of explanations that could be explored.</p>
</section>
<section id="hypothesis-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hypothesis-2">Hypothesis:</h3>
<p>Main hypothesis: Each group would be influenced by the dominant nature of electorally relevant information in their social networks—those who changed the party that they supported should be in networks where support for their new party is strong, whereas those who remained loyal to a party should be in networks that give it strong support.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="datamethods-6">Data/Methods:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Explores contextual effects on voting behavior in Great Britain</p></li>
<li><p>Uses data collected in the British Election Study (BES) from the 1992 British General Election, which lends itself to the data requirement of networks of people living in the same locality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The data uses a cluster rather than a random sample: 210 “points” (which are polling districts made up of 1,000-2,000 voters).</p></li>
<li><p>Used a stratified random design with a random sample of respondents selected from the electoral roll for the district</p></li>
<li><p>Produces 2,526 individuals with an average sample size of around 16 per cluster, with a peaked distribution between 16 and 19</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Authors chose to focus on why some respondents, from their own recollection, changed their vote between 1987 and 1992 while others did not</p></li>
<li><p>By aggregating the reported 1987 votes of each BES respondent by polling district, the authors were able to estimate the vote share there for each of the three main political parties that fought in all British constituencies in both 1987 and 1992: Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat (Alliance in 1987).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>First analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contrasts those who switched their vote to a particular party in 1992 (coded 1) against those who didn’t (coded 0)</p></li>
<li><p>Gives 3 dependent variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. switch to conservative 2) switch to labor 3) switch to Liberal</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Employs a Logistic Regression (because the DVs are binary)</p></li>
<li><p>Then does the same thing but looks at those who defected (voted for each party in 1987) So those who voted for a particular party in 1987 and again in 1992 (the loyalists) against those that voted for another party/ didn’t vote at all in 1992 (the defectors)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Second analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>looks at the impact of conversations with the individuals respondents named as the first (primary) discussant of politics and analyzing how that affected transitions to each party</p></li>
<li><p>Measures those who who didn’t vote for the same party in 1992 as they did in 1987 against those who did</p></li>
<li><p>Also looks at those who defected versus those who didn’t</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Third analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assesses the degree to which cross cutting relationships impact vote choice by bringing in two additional discussants that the respondents listed</p></li>
<li><p>The more discussants who support a particular party, the greater the expected probability that an individual will switch to that party, and the less the probability that he or she will defect from it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fourth analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s possible that discussants don’t live in the same neighborhood (i.e.&nbsp;context) as the respondent. Therefore, there a chance that political context and conversations on voting linked, or could they be separate?</p></li>
<li><p>hypothesize that the more support a party has in a locality (the independent variables employed in the regressions reported in Tables 3 and 4), the greater the probability that individuals there will encounter, talk to, and be converted by that party’s partisans</p></li>
<li><p>tested by dividing the respondents according to how many discussants they report having a particular partisanship, which can vary from 0 to 3.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings-8">Findings:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Social networks are indeed important influences on voting decisions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Families who talk together, vote together! (kinda) - voters were more likely to vote/not vote for a party based on conversations they had with their families</p></li>
<li><p>More accurately: those who talked together tended to vote together.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversations with friends are also important</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>First analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>the more their local area was dominated by supporters of a particular party, the greater the probability that individuals switched their support to that party between 1987 and 1992—if they had not voted for it at the first of those two election</p></li>
<li><p>local context did not influence voters’ decisions to abandon a party they have previously supported, but that the choice of which party to switch their support to was influenced by local conditions—which is the hypothesized mechanism that underlies the neighborhood effect.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Second analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Those who did not voter conservative in 1987 were more likely to vote conservative in 1992 if their primary discussant was conservative</p>
<ul>
<li>talking to Labour or Liberal party discussants made not conservative voters less likely to vote conservative (duh)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Same results hold for other parties - voters were more likely to vote for a particular party if the primary discussant was a member of that party</p></li>
<li><p>Frequency of conversation about politics appeared to have no influence</p></li>
<li><p>those people who voted for a party in 1987 were less likely to vote for another party in 1992 if their primary discussant had been a supporter of the same parter when compared to their discussant being from another party or having no discussant at all</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Third analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More likely to support and less likely to defect if the discussants were from the same party</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fourth Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a respondent had more discussants from a particular party, then there was also an associated increase in the number of votes for that party in the respondents district</p></li>
<li><p>This shows that there is a link between spatial and communicative contexts, supporting the neighboring effects.</p></li>

<p>This article examines recent trends in #Latin-American #voting-behavior and casts them in terms of sincere (economic) and strategic (electoral) concerns. It argues that thanks to years of economic adversity, Latin Americans have developed long, sophisticated #economic-memories . Although this has resulted in rising frustration with democratic government, according to recent opinion polls, it has not always led voters to #punish all parties responsible for hardship at election time. A panel study of the region’s presidential systems demonstrates that citizens punish incumbents by voting for established #nonincumbents when electoral laws reduce opportunities available to small parties in the systems, even if #nonincumbents have also been blamed for hard economic times. More #permissive-electoral-systems , in contrast, encourage citizens to reject all parties responsible for economic decline. The analysis demonstrates how economic and electoral concerns interact to affect voting behavior, #political-accountability , and #public-opinion in Latin America.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summarytheoryargument-4">Summary/Theory/Argument:</h3>
<p>Many Latin American economies have experienced some form poor performance that has resulted in different forms of electoral punishment. Barton, drawing on previous literature regarding economic theories of voter behavior, devises a theory that enables her to assess the institutional features that interact with economic performance to determine who voters choose to punish in subsequent elections. In highly permissible systems, where there are more parties to choose from, voters memories of economic performance can interact with electoral strategies to allow the punishment of multiple parties (as has been the case in multiple countries). However, more restrictive systems, which limit the number of viable parties, forces voters to focus their punishing efforts on the incumbent alone, as they require an alternative option of some form and therefore increases support for the form incumbent.</p>

<li>Originating with V.O. Key (1966), this type of voting occurs when voters review the performance of the incumbent government.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Prospective Voting
<ol type="1">
<li>Originating with Downs (1957), this type of voting occurs when voters look to the future and vote according to the governments potential economic performance.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Pocketbook Voting (personal finances)
<ol type="1">
<li>This theory of voting suggests that when personal or household financial conditions have deteriorated, voters will punish the incumbent.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Sociotropic Voting (national economy rather than personal finances).
<ol type="1">
<li>This theory of voting suggests that voters are more likely to be considering the national economic situation when casting their vote.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Of these types, the retrospective sociotropic and prospective sociotropic appear to be the most relevant across empirical evaluations. That is, people tend to vote based of their perceptions of national economic performance, both in the past (retrospective sociotropic) and the future (prospective sociotropic). The type of voting that is cued depends on whether or not an incumbent is running, and therefore a reliable place to point blame. Essentially, the reward-punishment hypothesis holds up across settings, with slight variation according to group membership (party id, gender, etc.), institutional context (voting system, prime-minister v. president, number of parties) and economic context (personal, neighborhood, national).</p>

<section id="united-states" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="united-states">United States:</h4>
<ul>
<li>ANES is good source for election studies</li>
<li>Most theories of economic voting focus on the U.S.</li>
<li>Pocketbook voting is weak in presidential elections -- sociotropic is strong</li>
<li>Strength of economic voting can cary based on context -- such is the case when considering the attribution of responsibility (e.g.&nbsp;the attribution of blame to particular party/candidate/branch of government)
<ul>
<li>in the U.S. the presidency is an important institutional context for which to blame punish electorally</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While other types of factors matter and interact them, sociotropic economic effects (both retrospective and prospective) themselves cannot be understated when assessing the general behavior of the voter population.</li>
</ul>

<section id="britain" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="britain">Britain:</h4>
<ul>
<li>BES is a good source for election studies</li>
<li>British voters show the same trends of reward and punishment regarding economic voting</li>
<li>There may be important regional contexts
<ul>
<li>Johnston 1997 finds that when voter’s perceptions of their neighborhoods are that they are worse off, they will punish the incumbent</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Retrospective and Prospective are both important</li>
<li>Perceptual shifts in economic conditions are almost as great as realigning with a different party (Clarke et al.&nbsp;2004)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="france" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="france">France:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eurobarometer and FNES are good sources for election studies</li>
<li>A general finding—significant retrospective sociotropic effects, but no retrospective pocketbook effects</li>
<li>It is largely sociotropic and more or less equally retrospective or prospective, depending in part on the institutional context.</li>
<li>The French voter is sophisticated, knowing whom and how much to blame.
<ul>
<li>When government is unified, the president is the lightning rod for economic discontent. However, under cohabitation, the burden shifts to the prime minister.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smaller parties are blamed less than large parties, legislative candidates are blamed less than presidential candidates, and presidential candidates who are prime minister are blamed more than presidential candidates who are not prime minister.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cross-national-studies" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-national-studies">Cross-National Studies:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Similar trends have been found in cross-national studies
<ul>
<li>Lewis‐Beck and Mitchell (1990), on the five major western European countries; Chappell and Veiga (2000), on thirteen western European nations; Pacek (1994) and Tucker (2001) on central European samples; Remmer (1991) on twelve Latin American countries; Pacek and Radcli (1995) on eight low‐income nations; Wilkin, Haller, and Norporth (1997) on a worldwide sample of countries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Important Takeaways:
<ul>
<li><p>Responsibility Hypothesis seems to hold - that when responsibility is hard to pin down, voters are less likely to punish incumbents - this is an important contextual factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Such is the case in more countries with more “coalitional complexity” -- when more parties make up the incumbent government, is it difficult to assign blame</p></li>
<li><p>Presidential Systems and systems with more restrictive electoral laws tend to strengthen the economic vote</p></li>
<li><p>In the context of globalization, there is a significant decrease in economic voting in the face of open trade, as electorates can’t assign blame to the government alone</p></li>
