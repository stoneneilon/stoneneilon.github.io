## About Me

I am a political science PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in American politics and methodology. My primary research examines the political implications of the built environment --- specifically, how physical spaces shape political networks, participation, and deliberation in both online and offline contexts.

In 2025, I was one of six political science graduate students to be awarded the [National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF)](I am a political science PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in American politics and methodology. My primary research examines the political implications of the built environment â€” specifically, how physical spaces shape political networks in both online and offline contexts.  My passion for this topic stems from a deep concern about the continued suburbanization of American neighborhoods and its effects on mental and social health. As face-to-face interactions decline, our capacity for democratic deliberation weakens. These changes create opportunities for individuals to reimagine their communities independent of geography, giving rise to new political identities and affiliations.). The GRF provides \$169,000 in total funding over three years.

When I'm not working or studying, you can find me at a music festival, building Lego, or attempting to stay fit.
