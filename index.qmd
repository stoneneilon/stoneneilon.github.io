## About Me

I am a political science PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in American politics and methodology. My primary research examines the political implications of the built environment --- specifically, how physical spaces shape political networks, participation, and deliberation in both online and offline contexts.

In 2025, I was one of six political science graduate students to be awarded the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF). The GRF provides \$169,000 in total funding over three years.

When I'm not working or studying, you can find me at a music festival, building Lego, or attempting to stay fit.
