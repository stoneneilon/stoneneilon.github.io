# Week 1

-   .gdb is the esri file type. It is messy inside.

-   save as project.

-   .gdb only contains the data

-   project file will contain the changes we make (like the symbology) and what we actually do.

-   Two types of data:

    -   coordinate - pairs or triplets of numbers defining location

    -   atrribute - text, numbers, images (non-spatial data)

-   Spatial objects

    -   points - 0 dimensions

    -   lines - 1 dimensions

    -   areas - 2 dimensions

    -   surfaces

    -   volumes

-   Raster and vector

    -   these are layer types

-   Object view:

    -   discrete objects

        -   buildings, lakes, etc.

-   Field view:

    -   continuously

        -   oceans, terrain

-   raster is a giant matrix basically.

    -   there are cells.

## Bolstad et al:

-   Coordinate Systems:

    -   coordinates are used to define the spatial location and the extent of geographic objects.

-   Digital spatial data:

    -   vector data model: this model uses discrete elements such as points, lines, polygons. to represent geometry of real-world entities.

        -   farm fields, roads, wetlands, cities, and census tracts are examples of entities that are often represented by discrete vector objects.
        -   poins, lines, polygons.

    -   Raster data model:

        -   grid ceells - think of a matrix.

            -   generally used for continuous variables.

                -   elevation, temperature, slope, average rainfall.

            -   can also be used for scirete features

                -   political units, vegetation.

        -   They have cell dimensions

            -   smaller cells = more detail = more data space on your comp.

    -   the line starting and eding points are often called nodes, and intermediate points used to represent the line shape are called vertices.

# Week 2:

## Understanding Cartographic Scale & Spatial Resolution

-   Map scale:

    -   the ratio between map distance and real world distance

    -   "Amount of reduction in the representation of a real world phenomenon on a map"

    -   Geometric error greater for smaller area

    -   1:250,000 is larger scale than 1:1,000,000

    -   Large scale maps cover small area but more detail ( we assume constant paper size)

-   Resolution:

    -   smallest spatial addressable unit in our representation

        -   smallest unit the map can present

-   Line length decreases with more generalization.

# Week 3:

Datum = reference point.

Longitude was actually very hard to figure out.

Map projection: a means of fitting features from the 3-D globe to a 2-D medium (map, computer screen)

No proper way to represent everything - THERE WILL BE DISTORTIONS.

use UTM zones for specific state maps - this will minimize distortion.

False Nothing

False Easting: 500,000m west of the zone's central meridian

US State Plane Coord system - better for study of states.
