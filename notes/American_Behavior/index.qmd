# Week 1

## Lecture Notes:

-   write a reaction paper (300 words)

### Essentials of Argument

-   Argument structure should guide response essays.

-   we are trying to convince readers we are competent and should be trusted.

-   starting with a problem and proposing a solution

-   always be thinking about audience.

-   just think about the parts of an argument when writing.

-   Five questions of argument:

    -   what are you claiming?

    -   what reasons do you have for believing your claim?

    -   what evidence do you base those reasons on?

    -   what principle connect?

    -   TK.

-   design of an experiment is a warrant.

-   You can make concessions to dissenters

    -   "admittedly", "some have claimed".

-   Keep it simple, stupid "KISS"

-   Good warrants:

    -   do readers know the warrant already?

    -   will all readers think it is true?

## Craft of Research (select portions)

-   Important to know your readers

    -   know how political scientists write/read.

    -   You have to know your readers to be able to write to them.

-   Motivation behind idea and potentially what data would be good for the project and what I would use.

    -   this is for the research design.

### Making Good Arguments

-   There are claims and main claims

    -   claims = any sentence that asserts something that may be true or false and so needs support.

    -   main claim = the sentence (or more) that your whole report supports (aka thesis).

    -   reason = a sentence that supporting a claim, main or not.

-   Evidence

    -   something you and your readers can see, touch, taste, smell, or hear; accepted by everyone - a fact.

    -   Where could I go to see your evidence?

-   Core of a research argument:

    -   **Claim** because of **Reason** based on **Evidence**

-   We dont accept a claim just because you back it up with *your* reasonsand *your* evidence

    -   as a result, readers may question any part of your argument

    -   Need to imagine readers objections!

-   Need to justify the connection between the reason and the claim.

    -   this is the **WARRANT!**

        -   if you think readers won't immedaitely see how a reason is relevant to your claim, then you justify the connection with a warrant, usually before you make it.

-   The five elements:

    -   Claim

    -   Reason

    -   Warrant

    -   Evidence

    -   Acknowledgement and Response

### Claim

-   vague claims lead to vague arguments

-   Write down your claim. Articulate it. Make it explicit. You can fix it later.

-   If the reverse of a claim seems self-evidently false, then most readers are unlikely to consider the original worth an argument.

-   If your claim is true...Why should I care?

-   arguments are more credible when you address its limitations.

    -   every claim is subject to countless conditions.

        -   only address ones you expect readers to bring up.

-   Use hedges for claims.

    -   gives argument nuance.

### Reasons and Evidence

-   Reasons outline the logic of your argument.

-   main claim \> reason \> subreason \> evidence

-   we don't base evidence on reasons

    -   we base reasons off of evidence

-   evidence is what readers accept as fact.

-   evidence or reports of evidence

    -   different things.

-   careful hedging your evidence

-   Need to explain evidence

### Acknowledgements and Responses

-   The core of your argument is a claim backed by a reason based on evidence.

-   But you can't only base your argument off your claims!

-   You need to anticipate questions readers may ask and respond accordingly.

-   be self-critical

-   Steps:

    -   First, question your problem.

    -   Second, question your support

        -   focus first on evidence

        -   Finally, readers may question the connection between your claim and reasons. Your reasons may be irrelevant of the claim.

-   Think of counterexamples

    -   acknowledge them and explain why don't consider them damaging to your argument.

    -   can't acknowledge everything. But can't ignore everything.

-   Readers have to accept your definitions!

-   Goal: **THICKEN** your argument.

-   be careful with the word choice when you engage with acknowledgements

### Warrants

-   **The logical relevance of your response to your claims.**

-   Readers can still accept your claim as true BUT they may not accept your claim if they think your reasons are irrelevant to it.

-   we offer warrants to connect a reason and a claim

-   Warrants are kind of like glue between reason and claim. They tell the reader why they should believe the reason/evidence should be used to support the claim.

# Week 2: The Classics

## Lecture Notes:

-   Question for Anand: why did you only assign those chapters of Downs? Isn't the punchline of Downs that rational voters lead to median voter theorem and the parties being similar to appeal?

-   Lazarsfeld et al. is considered the Columbia school.

-   sociological school - Columbia

-   Rat choice - Downs

-   social-psychological

## Campbell, Converse, Miller and Stokes. 1960. The American Voter. New York: Wiley. Chapters 1-2.\*

### Lecture Notes:

-   Question: voter competence?

-   Social-psychological model

    -   is there really a fight between social group importance with the Columbia school?

-   About voter decision making.

-   Michigan model - focused on mass public.

-   ANES data

-   Think Columbia school doesn't have enough a priori hypothesis.

-   I need to read Zuckerman.

-   Design: Survey Based

-   kind of taking individuals out of context.

-   we need to move beyond community and think about psychological things.

-   The funnel of causality.

    -   a way of trying to grapple with inputs.

    -   political socialization is going on in the background

-   Theory: party identification is what comes out of this.

-   I personally do not see a massive difference between this and the Columbia.

-   Attitudinal model - Michigan - social/psych - party id model.

-   party id is an enduring psychological attachment!

### Chapter 1: Setting

-   The activity of voting is as a means of reaching collective decisions from individual choices.

-   The voting behavior of a mass electorate can be seen within the context of a larger political system.

-   The empirical materials of our own work lie within a particular historical setting.

-   this research lies within a sequence of studies on voting.

-   The study of voting is also concerned with a fundamental process of political decision.

-   The political system can be idealized as a collection of processes for the taking of decisions.

-   will focus on just america and only the presidential election.

-   Contribution (as they outline):

    -   first is the political impact of identification with social class.

    -   second is the psychological determinants of voting preference.

-   Hypothesis: the partisan choice the individual voter makes depends in an immediate sense on the strength and direction of the elements comprising a field of psychological forces, where these elements are interpreted as attitudes toward the perceived objects of national politics.

-   data is over 3 presidential elections - 1948 - 1956.

### Chapter 2:

-   Understanding versus prediction

    -   "we are concerned with prediction per se only as it serves to test our understanding of the sequence of events leading to the dependent behavior."

-   There is a social and attitudinal model.

-   they use attitudinal model.

-   party identification is vital and acts as a filter.

    -   everything else is secondary.

    -   The use of political attitudes to predict voting behavior hinges upon this proximal mode of explanation.

-   Social model is more concerned with membership in social groups and their impact.

-   Doesn't: social group -\> party id -\> vote decision?

## Downs, Anthony. 1957. An Economic Theory of Democracy. New York: Harper. Chapters 1; 3.\*

### Lecture Notes:

-   Rational Choice approach.

-   Formal model.

-   Question: Why do people vote?

-   Question: How do people make decisions?

-   Questions: How do parties position themselves to win reelection? - we don't really discuss this.

-   I need to read liberalism v. populism by Riker.

-   Goal-oriented actors.

-   we are thinking about Downs in terms of his assumptions

    -   the basic idea of rationality.

-   Anand doesn't include the chapters on the interest groups/political parties.

-   Downs is filling out the scope of his argument conditions as the chapters move on.

-   Downs builds up the models with the assumptions. We make derivations from the model. Then we kind of start relaxing those assumptions and see how the predictions change.

### Chapter 1:

-   Chapter 1 seems to be justifying why we should study government through a economic rationality and what that entails (assumptions, etc.)

-   Goal: We want to predict behavior! Economic rationality is a tool/lens to help us predict rational and irrational behavior.

-   As opposed to government's impact on private decision making or the share of government in economic aggregates, Downs makes the point that government has not been successfully integrated with private decision-makers in a general equilibrium theory.

-   Thesis: Provide a behavior rule for democratic government.

    -   Provide such a rule by positing that democratic governments act rationally to maximize political support.

-   What is economic rationality?

    -   A rational man is one who behaves:

        -   1\) always makes a decision

        -   2\) he ranks all alternatives in order of preferences.

        -   3\) preference ranking is transitive

        -   4\) always chooses that which ranks highest in his preference

        -   5\) always makes the same decision each time he is confronted with the same alternatives

    -   these assumptions are applied to all the players: political parties, interest groups, and governments.

-   **Rationality: refers to the process of action, not to their ends or even to their success at reaching desired ends.**

-   Are inefficient men always irrational or can rational men also act inefficiently?

    -   a mistaken rational man at least intends to strike an accurate balance between costs and returns; whereas an irrational man deliberately fails to do so.

    -   rational man corrects mistake if known and the cost of eliminating it is smaller than the benefits therefrom.

    -   if a man exhibits political behavior which does not help him attain his political goals efficiently, we feel justified in labeling him politically irrational, no matter how necessary to his psychic adjustments this behavior may be.

#### The Structure of the Model

-   **Our model is based on the assumption that every government seeks to maximize political support.**

    -   **periodic elections are held**

        -   **primary goal is reelection**

        -   the election is the goal of those parties now out of power.

    -   party that receives the most votes controls the entire government until the next election.

    -   no intermediate votes

    -   governing party has unlimited freedom of actions.

    -   government cannot hamper the operations of other political entities. (or freedoms)

    -   No economic limits to its power.

-   **With these assumptions, we can construct a model showing how a rational government behaves in the kind of democratic state we outlined above.**

-   There is uncertainty in our "world".

    -   uncertainty = imperfect information.

-   **"Thus our model could be described as a study of political rationality from an economic point of view. By comparing the picture of rational behavior which emerges from this study with what is known about actual political behavior, the reader should be able to draw some interesting conclusions about the operation of democratic politics."**

#### The Relation of our Model to Previous Economic Models of Government

-   This is kind of the warrant section for the article? Why do we need a new model? What do others do and why are they insufficient?

-   Previous models are normative.

-   Downs model is positive. - deductive

-   Downs discusses previous models, mainly focusing on Buchanan-Samuelson approach

    -   Samuelson posits two mutually exclusive ways to view decision making by the state:

        -   1\) consider the state a separate person with its own ends not necessarily related to the ends of the individuals

            -   Downs disagree with this

        -   2\) only individuals as having end structures. The state has no welfare function of its own; it is merely a means by which individuals can satisfy some of their wants collectively.

            -   Downs thinks this is partly true.

                -   the individualistic view is incomplete because it doesn't take coalitions into consideration.

-   Problem: discovering a relationship between the ends of individuals at large and the ends of the coalition which does not restrict government to providing indivisible benefits. p.17

-   Our model attempts to forge a positive relationship between individual and social end structures by means of a political device.

-   **in our model, government pursues its goal under three considerations:**

    -   a democratic political structure which allows opposition parties to exist

    -   an atmosphere of varing degrees of uncertainty,,

    -   **and an electorate of rational voters.**

-   **We wish to discover what form of political behavior is a rational for the government and citizens of a democracy.**

### Chapter 2: Party Motivation and the Function of Government in Society

-   **Theoretical models should be tested primarily by the accuracy of their predictions rather than by the reality of their assumptions.**

    -   interesting general point.

-   Anand just provides one page of chapter 2 lol

### Chapter 3: The Basic Logic of Voting

-   In order to plan its policies so as to gain votes, the government must discover some relationship between what it does and how citizens vote.

    -   This is derived from the axiom that **citizens act rationally in politics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

    -   This implies that each citizen casts his vote for the party he believes will provide him with more benefits than any other.

-   Need to show what rational voting implies.

#### Utility Income From Government Activities

-   Utility is a measure of benefits in a citizen's mind which he uses to decide among alternative courses of action.

    -   a rational man always takes the one which yields him the highest utility.

-   Citizens are utility maximizers.

-   Government activity provides a utility income to citizens.

    -   includes benefits they know and do not know they are receiving.

        -   however, only benefits which voters become conscious of by election day can influence their voting decisions; otherwise their behavior would be irrational.

#### The Logical Structure of the Voting Act

##### Terminology of the analysis:

-   unit of time: election period.

    -   time elapsed between elections.

##### The Two Party Differentials:

-   each voter votes for the party they believe will provide him with a higher utility income than any other party during the coming election period.

    -   to find this, they compare the utility incomes they believe they would receive from each party.

-   $$E(U^A_{t+1}) - E(U^B_{t+1})$$

-   this is the expected party differential

    -   if positive: vote incumbent

    -   if negative: vote opposition

    -   if zero: abstain.

-   **A rational voter bases their view of the future off the past/present**.

    -   thus what is most important is the CURRENT party differential.

        -   utility the individual earned from the party at time $t$

##### The Trend Factor and Performance Ratings:

1.  Trend factor: the adjustment each citizen makes in his current party differential to account for any relative trend in events that occurs within the current election period.

2.  When the individual cannot see any difference between the two parties running

    1.  to escape this, they alter their decision to whether or not the incumbents have done as good a job governing as did their predecessors in office.

        1.  reminds me of a nature of the times voter in some fashion.

-   Rational men are not interested in policies but in their own utility incomes.

-   Performance ratings become a thing when the individual things the parties are the same.

#### Preliminary Difficulties Caused By Uncertainty

-   The world doesn't have complete and costless information

    -   there is uncertainty!

-   Individual can only estimate their utility income.

-   They will base them upon those few areas of government activity where the **difference between parties is great enough to impress them.**

-   Downs excludes deliberate misinformation/disinformation.

-   **Downs assumes political tastes are fixed** and only new information can change their mind.

#### Variations in Multiparty System

-   same thing applies only the individual compares the incumbent against multiple parties.

-   However, a rational voter not may vote for their preference because they another party may have a better chance of winning.

-   An important part of voting is predicting how other citizens will vote by estimating their preferences.

## Lazarsfeld et al. 1944. The People's Choice. Prefaces; Chapters 1-3; 6.\*

### Lecture Notes:

-   Community study.

-   panel study - changes over time.

-   A contained social setting by rooting the study in Erie.

-   Design: Survey/community

    -   Designed to see how people change between the elections.

-   Question: How do attitudes form? Do campaigns actually work? Social group influence? Context!?

    -   How do we situate individuals in context?

-   Politics has gotten nationalized today - which is different from Lazarsfeld time.

-   They are going to look at social groups and the salience of social groups.

    -   think about the different variables.

-   you can see the origin of identity politics in this reading.

-   How they set this up is a good way to set up your papers and the further complicate the story.

-   Theory contribution: the role of cross-pressures.

    -   sociological

-   Columbia is social approach

    -   big contribution is cross-pressure.

-   Michigan is social psychological

-   Why does this matter?

    -   the parties are becoming a social identity.

-   Social groups and party id is the same. - liliana mason

    -   this is the difference today.

-   academic ambivalence - it is struggling between competing considerations

    -   it does not mean indifferent!

-   This work is important because it establishes political communication, information flow, media effects,

    -   they did not find a big influence of radio and newspaper on vote choice.

### Preface:

-   *The People's Choice* is focused on the formation, change, and development of public opinion.

    -   how do attitudes form?

-   the role of turnover in the election. turnover represents opinion/behavior is unstable (if large).

-   Lazarsfeld et al. asks some interesting rhetorical questions:

    -   What types of events show a small or large turnover as they develop?

    -   Does the turnover tend to become smaller as the events run their course?

    -   At what point is a minimum turnover reached and what is likely to increase it again?

    -   Under what conditions do we have a balanced turnover, as in this case, where the changes in various directions seem to cancel each other?

        -   all of these kind of remind me of Gelman & King's article on polls/elections/campaigns.

-   Turnover is the result of changes which come about in the intentions, expectations, and behavior of individual persons.

-   Three questions arise

    -   What kind of people are likely to shift?

    -   Under what influences do these shifts come about?

    -   In what directions are the shifts made?

-   "In the present study, face-to-face contacts turned out to be the most important influences stimulating opinion change.

    -   "The discovery of the conditions under which attitudes or modes of behavior are particularly accessible to personal influence, the classification of types of personal influence most effective in modifying opinion, the examination of situations in which the more formal influences of mass media seem to produce change, all these are typical problems for what we have called dynamic social research." xxvi

-   xxvi is very interesting overview. Definitely come back here.

-   "We thus came to the conclusion that party changes are in the direction of greater consistency and homogeneity within subgroups. p.139"

-   Making an argument that in 1944, there was greater democratic machinery in Erie, causing more to side with democrats as opposed to 1940 which saw more side with republicans when their machinery was stronger.

-   FUTURE STONE: XXXII -XXXIII YOU NEED TO READ AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT IS INCREDIBLY SUCCINT.

    -   discussion about cross-pressure, information gathering, social bridging, etc.

-   individuals who experienced cross-pressures took considerably longer to arrive at a definite vote decision.

-   "In the present study we found that one of the functions of opinion leaders is to mediate between the mass media and other people in their groups. It is commonly assumed that individuals obtain their information directly from newspapers, radio, and other media. Our findings, however, did not bear this out. The majority of people acquired much of their information and many of their ideas through personal contacts with the opinion leaders in their groups. These latter individuals, in turn, exposed themselves relatively more than others to the mass media.

### Chapter 1:

-   Goal: Discover how and why people decide to vote as they did.

    -   What were the major influences upon them during the campaign of 1940?

-   Focus: development of an individuals vote during the campaign.

    -   this is going to bring up additional questions about attitude formation more broadly.

-   Data: Panel data - this is new at the time.

-   Survey data: individuals living in Erie county, Ohio 1940/1944.

    -   600 people - stratified sampling.

    -   they were aware of interview frequency biasing results! back in 1940?!

    -   would have liked the poll to have an extra month before the conventions.

    -   different panels with different frequency of interviews.

### Chapter 2:

-   Describes the county of Erie.

-   goal is to know *why* people voted the way they did.

-   Sandusky - church was a major factor in life.

-   mixed industrial and agriculture type.

-   labor as a political bloc was not very strong.

-   Not a lot of solidarity among the ethnic groups within the county,

-   1940 - republican campaign was more organized in the county than democrats,.

-   proceeds to list important local, national, and international events for each half of the month.

    -   This is interesting and I think works because the information flow is so much less than what we have now.

### Chapter 3: Social Differences Between Republicans and Democrats

-   Different social cleavages and arrangements between the parties.

-   Question: What exactly is the role of socio-economic status in the composition of the two parties.

-   previous socio-economic classifications in the literature are suspect.

-   Richer people supported republicans more and poorer people supported democrats more.

-   How do people think of their social status vs. their actual social status?

    -   Do democrats on average, have greater congruence between their perceived social status and their actual? vice versa with republicans?

-   They then look at religion coupled with the socio-economic classifications.

    -   Catholics much more likely to be democratic

    -   what is the role of religion in today's political landscape?

        -   is it still a strong cleavage?

-   "Legend has it that older people are more conservative in most things, including politics, both because they like to perpetuate their own idealized past and because they have more to conserve." p.23-24

    -   a study that could separate these two mechanisms would be awesome!

        -   not sure if it has been done before?

    -   "In other words, advancing age may not bring political conservatism but it does bring social conservatism." p.25

-   Gives brief mention to rural/urban divide in vote choice.

-   **"There is a familiar adage in American folklore to the effect that a person is only what he thinks he is, an adage which reflects the typically American notion of unlimited opportunity, the tendency toward self-betterment, etc. Now we find that the reverse of the adage is true: [a person thinks, politically, as he is, socially. SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS DETERMINE POLITICAL PREFERENCE."]{.underline}**

    -   interesting point. Psychological mechanism at play. It isn't just social characteristics perse, but how individuals PERCEIVE themselves socially -\> how they act politically.

        -   What is the congruence between their perception and actual?

### Chapter 6: Time of Final Decision

-   Why do people decide who to vote for at different times?

-   Delayed decision - had less interest in the election

-   those who made their choice late - subject to more cross-pressures.

-   more interest = the sooner they decide who to vote for.

    -   they were also more likely to express anxiety.

-   this all is very similar to Campbell.

-   Those who decide late were also less concerned about the ramifications of the election and who won.

-   What cross-pressure will win out? That is which has more influence - religion or socio-economic status?

-   The different cross-pressures analyzed:

    -   Religion and SES level

    -   Occupation and Identification

    -   1936 and 1940 Vote

    -   The voter and his family

    -   the voter and his associates

    -   1940 Vote Intention and attitude Toward Business and Government

-   Why did people subject to cross-pressures delay their final decisions as to how they should vote?

    -   the single biggest factor in delaying vote was the lack of complete agreement within the family.

    -   second, some are waiting for "events" to resolve the conflicting pressures

        -   I wonder how this squares with Gelman & King

            -   need to revisit that.

-   "We will recall that the people who make up their minds last are those who think the election will affect them least." p.61

-   "Our hypothesis that the person or the party that convinces the hesitant voter of the importance of the election to him personally-in terms of what he concretely wants-can have his vote." p.61

    -   we know from previous lit that, the voter might not know concretely what they want.

-   As the number of cross-pressures increases, the degree of interest shows a steady decline.

    -   this is interesting. I wonder why this is.

    -   maybe cross-pressures make it harder for the individual to realize the "fundamentals".

# Week 3: Political Knowledge

## Lecture Notes:

-   The readings are all wrestling between the effect of individual level features and/or environmental levels on political knowledge acquisition.

-   If you critique all readings - make sure you broaden the claim.

-   Main Question: Does the public have enough knowledge?

-   Main Question: What do we mean when we say a "knowledgeable public"?

-   What does the public know?

    -   facts?

        -   who is in government?

        -   current events

        -   processing/synthesizing info.

            -   critical thinking skills.

-   Knowledge -\> participation

-   Access to information to have knowledge.

-   Quality of information -\> Decisions?

-   Mondak likes jazz. Also read for the "don't know" argument.

-   If the public is dumb, what might save them?

    -   Heuristics!

        -   but also bias and a mixed bag.

-   Correct voting. Does your vote match your preferences.

-   political knowledge = factual things - timeless/timely

-   political sophistication: combo of interest and awareness - zaller invention - interest + factual knowledge. kinda an index measure.

-   Simple to heterogeneity

    -   vairation in question types

    -   different variation in person types of who can get knowledge

    -   personality/dispositions effect knowledge.

## Barabas, Jason, Jennifer Jerit, William Pollock, and Carlisle Rainey. 2014. "The Question(s) of Political Knowledge." *American Political Science Review.* 108:840-855.

### Lecture Notes:

-   survey issues with political knowledge questions.

-   building into their model that some knowledge model questions are different than others and more difficult.

    -   not all tasks are equal.

-   multilevel modeling

    -   allow certain parameters to vary across question types.

-   dangerous to talk about knowledge in monolithic terms.

#### Abstract:

Political knowledge is a central concept in the study of public opinion and political behavior. Yet what the field collectively believes about this construct is based on dozens of studies using different indicators of knowledge. We identify two theoretically relevant dimensions: a temporal dimension that corresponds to the time when a fact was established and a topical dimension that relates to whether the fact is policy-specific or general. The resulting typology yields four types of knowledge questions. In an analysis of more than 300 knowledge items from late in the first decade of the 2000s, we examine whether classic findings regarding the predictors of knowledge withstand differences across types of questions. In the case of education and the mass media, the mechanisms for becoming informed operate differently across question types. However, differences in the levels of knowledge between men and women are robust, reinforcing the importance of including gender-relevant items in knowledge batteries.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   Political knowledge is not as simple as we think.

### Research Question:

-   What determines who is informed?

-   How does the temporal dimension relate to knowledge acquisition

### Hypothesis:

-   Levels of knowledge for recent facts should be lower relative to facts that were established years or decades ago because there have been fewer opportunities for people to acquire such facts.

-   We expect that level of education will have a stronger (and more positive) relationship to general measures of political knowledge than it does to policy-specific knowledge.

-   We hypothesize that the effect of mass media on knowledge varies along the temporal dimension on figure 1.

    -   we expect to observe a positive relationship between the amount of media coverage and surveillance facts, but little or no relationship between the level of media coverage and static facts.

-   The knowledge gap between men and women will be smaller for gendered questions compared with nongendered questions in each of the four cells.

### Background:

![](knowledge.gif){fig-align="center"}

-   The present study provides a framework for understanding how the content or type of question affects observed levels of knowledge.

-   **Political Knowledge -** Delli Carpini & Keeter's definition - "The range of factual information about politics that is stored in long-term memory.

    -   How does this differ from **political sophistication?**

        -   keep this in mind.

    -   3 factors:

        -   ability

        -   opportunity

        -   motivations

-   How is a fact learned?

    -   first factor: how recently the fact came into being

    -   second factor: the type of fact - whether the question has to do with public policy concerns or the institutions and people/players of government (topical dimension).

-   General v. policy

    -   General - questions ask about the institutions and people/players of government

        -   Carpini and Keeter emphasize the importance of general.

    -   Policy-specific - whether the question has to do with public policy concerns

        -   Gilens strong advocate

            -   "many people who are fully informed in terms of general political knowledge are nonetheless ignorant of policy-specific information that would alter their political judgments."

        -   policy specific is more domain-specific than general

            -   thus harder to acquire.

                -   thus need greater motivation to acquire that information.

#### What We Know About Political Knowledge:

-   Ability - level of education

    -   Education was the "strongest single predictor of knowledge"

    -   education has a direct effect on political knowledge and an indirect effect through political engagement and structural factoprs such as occupation and income.

    -   most schools teach about institutions and processes of government.

        -   empirical analysis mostly looks at general political knoweldge.

    -   *we expect that level education will have a stronger (and more positive) relationship to general measures of political knowledge than it does to policy specific knowledge*

-   Opportunity - the amount of news coverage

    -   more information available.

    -   Delli Carpini, Keeter, and Kennamer find that people living close to the capitol are more knowledgeable about state politics than those living farther away.

        -   interesting! Is this a media story though? Or is this a geographical/physical interaction story?

    -   The level of political knowledge increases as information about particular topics becomes more plentiful

        -   there is an assumption here, that this information is "correct".

        -   **are we testing solely on events?**

-   Motivation - self- or group-interest

    -   gender gap in political knowledge.

        -   why?

            -   might be because of the question we ask.

                -   women have much great knowledge when the question has direct relevance to women as a group.

                -   **mechanism: women have higher levels of knowledge on "Gendered" questions as a result of the instrumental benefits of learning particular facts.**

### Data and Methods:

-   Original dataset

-   lots of observations (tens of thousands)

-   surveys were augmented with media content data and other controls.

-   Depedent Variable: **Knowledge**

    -   Pew research and Roper archives for surveys about knowledge in the later half of the 2000s

    -   questions about public policy, people in office, etc.

-   Independent Variables: **Question and Environmental level indicators**

    -   Each knowledge question was coded for the two question-level characteristics appearing in fig 1. (surveillance vs. static and policy-specific vs. general).

        -   temporal dimension: when the even occured - when the fact became established.

            -   when the person took office. When the bill passed. Last measure of unemployment prior to the question being asked in the survey.

        -   surveillance facts were treated as those in which the correct answer was established 100 days prior to survey. all other questions were coded as static.

    -   43% surveillance and 57% static

    -   Questions haveing to do with institutions of gov or people and players were coded as zero

        -   domestic policies, actions by congress, or foreign policy topics = 1

-   To examine the effect of mass media on knowledge, we characterized the info environment for each topic.

    -   Use the Pew Research News Coverage Index (NCI) project.

        -   provides a broad snapshot of which stories are being reported in the media at a given time and by who.

            -   The media coverage variable is the NCI count of stories concerning a given knowledge question extending six weeks back in time. Thus, for a question asking which office Hillary Clinton holds in the beginning of June 2010, we counted NCI stories having to do with Hillary Clinton from roughly the middle of April until the field date of the survey. The six-week cutoff, though somewhat arbitrary, ensures that potential learning effects of current coverage are not misidentified due to less relevant levels of coverage in the past.

-   Also have individual level indicators

    -   edu range from 1 (least) to 8 (most)

    -   income

    -   age

    -   gender

    -   race

    -   partisanship

    -   they used multiple imputation and averaged.

### Result:

-   unit of analysis: a person's response to a knowledge question.

-   logit model - outcome : which is the probability that individual i answers question j correctly.

    -   a function of individual-level and question-level characteristics.

-   use random effects because to account for question clustering given by the same individual in survey questions.

-   They use fixed effects for certain $\beta_j$ which is income, age, black, democrat, and republican

-   $n_j$ represent question level random effects - which allow the effect of gender and education to vary across questions.

-   $a_i$ signifies an individual level random intercept (interpreted as the variation in individuals political knowledge)

    -   I thought this is our DV???????

-   $$
    Pr(y_{ij}=1)=logit^{-1}(a_i+n^{cons}_j +n^{edu}_jEducation_i + n^{fem}_jFemale_i+\beta_{inc}Income_i+\beta_{age}Age_i+\beta_{black}Black_i+\beta_{dem}Democrat_i+\beta_{rep}Republican_i)
    $$

-   First difference: represents how the probability of a correct answer changes as an explanatory variable moves from one substantively meaningful value to another.

#### The Effect of Education:

-   increasing education has a higher effect for general facts rather than for policy facts.

-   probability of getting the correct answer to a static-general knowldge question increases with education. This is bigger than static policy question

-   people with the most education remain ignorant of certain policy facts.

-   "**Level of education is positively related to knowledge in all four quadrants, but there are statistically significant differences in the strength of that relationship, precisely in the manner we expect."**

#### Learning from Media Coverage:

-   recall the second hypothesis: the positive relationship between news coverage and knowledge stablished by previous studies will be largely confined to surveillance facts.

    -   more news -\> more knowledge of surveillance facts.

    -   more news not equal to more knowledge of static facts.

-   Observe a large effect from a low to high media environment on surveillance-general facts is large.

-   Observe a null effect on surveillance-policy facts.

#### The Gender Gap

-   smaller knowledge gap between genders on gendered questions.

### Discussion:

-   Education does not confer the same benefits across different types of questions.

-   Mass media effect is largely confined to ***recent*** facts.

-   gender knowledge gap is smaller when questions are gendered.

-   We should include knowledge questions along with the standard set of demographic items in all opinion survey.

### Lecture Notes:

-   Bartels says voters are misguided and ignorant.

### Abstract:

Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin show that well-informed Republicans and conservatives were highly supportive of the 2001 Bush tax cut. They mistakenly infer that this fact invalidates my claim in "Homer Gets a Tax Cut" that "the strong plurality support" for the tax cut was "entirely attributable to simple ignorance." Their analysis, like mine, implies that a fully-informed public would have been lukewarm, at best, toward the tax cut. They have little to say about why this is the case, beyond insisting that "citizens have reasons for the opinions they have." I suggest that citizens' "reasons" are sometimes misleading, misinformed, or substantively irrational, and that social science should not be limited to "attempts to better fit our analyses into their rationales."

### Background:

-   Bartels wrote "Homer Gets a Tax Cut".

    -   Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin write an article where they disagree with the findings. They claim Bartels' makes an improper assumption.

        -   Liberals with more info did not support tax cuts while Rep with more info increased support of tax cuts.

-   Debate about information effects on republicans/conservatives supporting Bush tax cuts.

-   According to Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin, more informed republicans were roughly similar to less informed republicans on their views of tax cuts.

    -   they found more informed dems v. less informed dems had a higher divergence.

-   NES 2002 is not as reliable as other years. It was kinda bad this year.

-   **I certainly agree with Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin's key claim that political information may have different effects on different people.**

### Debate:

-   Bartels agrees with Lupia et al.'s claim that political information may have different effects on different people

-   They disagree on the "implications of this heterogeneity for my conclusions about the bases of support for the Bush tax cut."

    -   this is a mouthful.

        -   they disagree over the conclusions about what Bartels has to say about people who support the Tax cut.

-   "The fact that ideological and partisan disagreements about the tax cut only emerged clearly among relatively well-informed people will come as no surprise"

    -   I think he is basically saying that this is obvious and this is what Zaller shows.

        -   **THIS IS THE KEY POINT: "IN THE CASE OF THE BUSH TAX CUT, HOWEVER, UNINFORMED CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL VALUES WERE VERY LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE POLICY-IF THEY TOOK ANY POSITION AT ALL.**

-   Much of Lupia, Levine, Menning, and Sin's critique focuses on my claim that "the strong plurality support for Bush's tax cut ... is entirely attributable to simple ignorance."

-   It does suggest that a fully-informed citizenry would have been lukewarm toward the tax cut, at best. Is that fact relevant to understanding

-   Bartels examines a variety of potential bases of public support for the Bush tax cut

-   Bartels argues they basically paraphrase his same argument.

-   Their analysis, like mine, implies that a fully-informed public would have been lukewarm, at best, toward the tax cut. They have little to say about why this is the case, beyond insisting that "citizens have reasons for the opinions they have." I suggest that citizens' "reasons" are sometimes misleading, misinformed, or substantively irrational, and that social science should not be limited to "attempts to better fit our analyses into their rationales."

-   **Lupia et al. unsubtle effort to, quite literally, change the subject is in service of a broader goal: rationalizing every political thinking and behavior.**

    -   the heart of their argument is that "citizens have reasons for the opinions they have", and that we as social scientists should "conduct scholarship that attempts to better fit our analyses into their rationales."

        -   Bartels agrees we need to understand people's rational. HOWEVER:

            -   he seems to be arguing that these authors are making the point that all citizens can rationalize the opinions they have.

                -   it is this that he disagrees with:

                    -   "However, decades of psychological research have amply demonstrated that people's subjective understandings of their own behavior are often incomplete, predictably biased, and sometimes highly misleading.

-   This does not mean well-informed people should always be considered substantively rational.

    -   **Here, as in many other instances, better-informed people seem mostly to have grasped the biased world-view of "their" political elites rather than an accurate perception of real social conditions**

        -   YES I AGREE!

## Delli Carpini, M. and S. Keeter. 1996. *What American Know about Politics and Why it Matters.* New Haven: Yale University Press. Chapters 2-4\*(skim)

-   we don't really know what people know - thus we get this book

-   big debate about whether we should give "don't know" options.

### Chapter 2:

-   How much info does the American public have on politics is like the biggest question.

-   people ought to know the structure of government and its basic elements.

-   "The democratic citizen is expected to be well-informed about political affairs. He is supposed to know what the issues are, what their history, what the relevant facts are, what alternatives are proposed, what the party stands for, what the consequences are."

    -   lol

-   Three broad areas of political knowledge:

    -   the rules of the game

    -   the substance of politics

    -   people and parties.

-   "None of this relieves citizens of their individual responsibility to be informed, but it suggests that an informed citizenry requires not only will, but also opportunity."

    -   interesting point.

### Chapter 3: Stability and Change in Political Knowledge

-   Ability, motivation, opportunity.

-   Tension between looking to the past and looking to the future.

-   Americans are essentially no more nor less informed about politics than they were fifty years ago.

-   we should expect more edu -\> civic ability and understanding

    -   this isn't necessarily true.

-   For Neil Postman, the dominance of television as the central form of public discourse has reduced teaching to "an amusing activity," as children and young adults increasingly demand to be entertained rather than education (1985)

    -   like this quote. Certainly has gotten worse!

-   Decline in education related to the progressive movement?

    -   they say we don't emphasize the accumulation of facts enough?

        -   I need to dig into this a bit more. Not sure how i feel.

-   education teaches you how to acquire info and provides substantive info.

-   workplace is important too

-   "perhaps the greatest opportunity to learn about politics is provided by the mass media."

-   "The greatest contribution of electronic media to democracy should occur in the widespread distribution of public-affairs information to citizens. In a sense, most of the provisions under which media operate in democratic societies are intended to achieve this fundamental goal..."

    -   lol.

        -   And Barber argues that "the capabilities of the new technology can be used to strengthen civic education, guarantee equal access to information, and tie individuals and institutions into networks that will make real participatory discussion and debate possible across great distances"

            -   LOL

-   "Henry David Thoreau's Walden:"We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate...."

    -   Postman and others also argue that electronic media are unsuited for the kind of rational argumentation and deliberation required in democratic discourse

        -   YES!

            -   p.113

                -   read it.

                    -   "A related concern is that the seductive nature of television ---the ease with which it can be watched, its entertaining and visually arresting format---is driving citizens away from newspapers and magazines, while at the same time forcing the print media to compete by turning to shorter, less demanding stories and the use of such techniques as color graphics.

-   Perhaps the greater nationalization of politics is because citizens are increasingly motivated to follow national politics - creating a cycle.

### Chapter 4:

-   "For example, whereas partisans are more informed than nonpartisans, strong republicans are significant more informed than are strong Democrats."

    -   the survey was in 1989

        -   I wonder if timing has to do with this.

            -   There is a connection between interest and knowledge that is going untested

                -   I wonder if Democrats decrease in their political interest when they are in control

                -   Republicans subsequently may increase their political attention/interest when the outparty is in office

                    -   Taber and Lodge argument being made here.

-   "Political learning is affected not only by individual factors, such as one's interest in politics, but also-and often profoundly- by forces external to the individual: the information environment and more, generally, the political context in which learning occurs."

## Enders, A.M., Uscinski, J.E., Seelig, M.I. et al. 2023. The Relationship Between Social Media Use and Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories and Misinformation. Polit Behav 45, 781--804.

### Abstract:

Numerous studies find associations between social media use and beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation. While such findings are often interpreted as evidence that social media causally promotes conspiracy beliefs, we theorize that this relationship is conditional on other individual-level predispositions. Across two studies, we examine the relationship between beliefs in conspiracy theories and media use, finding that individuals who get their news from social media and use social media frequently express more beliefs in some types of conspiracy theories and misinformation. However, we also find that these relationships are conditional on conspiracy thinking----the predisposition to interpret salient events as products of conspiracies----such that social media use becomes more strongly associated with conspiracy beliefs as conspiracy thinking intensifies. This pattern, which we observe across many beliefs from two studies, clarifies the relationship between social media use and beliefs in dubious ideas.

### Bumper Sticker:

### Research Question:

### Hypothesis:

-   "We hypothesize that while social media is likely to spread conspiracy theories and some misinformation, such information will be most likely to translate into beliefs for those already attract to conspiratorial explanations for salient events."

    -   ok? BUT what is the mechanism that causes people to be more likely attracted to conspiratorial explanations?

        -   I need to see this for me to care (in my opinion)

-   For those who exhibit the lowest level of conspiratorial thinking, we should observe only a very weak relationship.

-   H1: Those who use social media as their primary source for news and spend more time on social media will, all else equal, believe in more conspiracy theories and some misinformation than those who obtain news elsewhere and spend less time on social media platforms.

-   H2: The impact of social media use is conditional on conspiracy thinking, such that the association between social media use and conspiracy beliefs is weaker for those exhibiting low levels of conspiracy thinking compared to those exhibiting higher levels.

### Background:

-   (looking at the abstract) if social media use -\> more beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation; conditional on certain predispositions...

    -   what are those predispositions and what is the mechanism there.

        -   That is the more interesting part in my opinion.

-   The predisposition for the adoption of conspiracy theories is **conspiracy thinking.**

```         
-   Conspiracy thinking is a latent predisposition to interpret events and circumstances as the product of malevolent conspiracies, a tendency to impose a conspiratorial narrative on salient affairs.
```

-   So social media increases belief in conspiracy theories and misinfo. when people exhibit higher conspiratorial thinking

    -   but is this a supply argument? Social media just increases the amount if info that can be spread so...maybe then the mechanism for social media specifically increasing belief in conspiracy and misinformation is that it just provides a much greater supply.

### Data:

-   2 studies

-   National survey (n=2023)

-   march 2020.

-   examine beliefs in 15 conspiracy theories and support of QAnon.

    -   questions through Qualtrix.

### Dependent Variable:

-   belief in \# of conspiratory theories

### Independent Variable:

-   primary source for finding news

-   how often in a typical week they visit or use (on a 5 point scale for each social media website.

-   conspiracy thinking.

    -   four item measure

        -   5 point scale - to four statements such as:

            -   Much of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in secret places.

### Control Theory:

-   partisanship

-   ideological self-identification

-   interest in politics

-   educational attainment

-   age

-   household income

-   gender

-   race and ethnicity.

### Results:

-   Those who use social media as their primary source of news hold significantly more conspiracy beliefs, on average, than those who use any other medium.

-   Newspapers also popped but have a large error bars.

-   Moreover, the more frequently one engages social media platforms----for news or otherwise----the more conspiracy beliefs they tend to hold.

-   "In model 3, we observe a statistically significant interaction between conspiracy thinking and frequency of social media use, though we do not observe a significant interaction between conspiracy thinking and use of social media-rather than other media-for news."

    -   this is interesting??!

        -   i wonder if this is an authority story.

            -   Social media is democratic

-   Individuals must possess a belief system hospitable to conspiratorial information.

    -   the more likely one is to see conspiracies in all manner of cultural and political events, the stronger the relationship between social media use and beliefs in dubious ideas.

-   Have to have some attraction to conspiratorial explanations to be a necessary ingredient of conspiracy belief.

-   "These patterns situate nicely within a growing body of literature finding that the effects of online misinformation and conspiracy theories are likely smaller than commonly assumed and concentrated among audiences exhibiting particular characteristics."

-   "Our findings run counter to the prevailing journalistic narrative that social media widely spreads conspiracy theories and misinformation, exposing unwitting consumers to dubious ideas who adopt them in short order."

    -   but what about repeated exposure overtime? The exposure and subsequent acceptance might be something that occurs over a time period.

        -   in this sense, conspiratorial thinking is socialized and not something inherent maybe?

            -   they are fuzzy about conspiracy thinking.

    -   But how is this not a supply story?

## Lau, Richard P., and David P. Redlawsk. 2001. "Advantages and Disadvantages of Cognitive Heuristics in Political Decision Making." AJPS . 45:951-71.

### Abstract:

This article challenges the often untested assumption that cognitive "heuristics" improve the decisionmaking abilities of everyday voters. The potential benefits and costs of five common political heuristics are discussed. A new dynamic processtracing methodology is employed to directly observe the use of these five heuristics by voters in a mock presidential election campaign. We find that cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex. A hypothesized interaction between political sophistication and heuristic use on the quality of decision making is obtained across several different experiments, however. As predicted, heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices. A situation in which experts can be led astray by heuristic use is also illustrated. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for strategies to increase input from under-represented groups into the political process.

### Research Question:

1.  What are the individual and contextual determinants of heuristic use?

2.  Does the use of heuristics affect (without prejudging whether it improves or hinders) the quality of political decision making

### Five Political Heuristic:

1.  Party affiliation

2.  candidate's ideology

3.  Endorsements

4.  polls

    1.  provide "viability" info

5.  Candidate appearance

    1.  Dukakis in the tank.

### Hypothesis:

-   we hypothesize that the use of cognitive heuristics generally will be associated with higher quality decisions

-   we expect heuristic use to be most efficacious for political experts

-   the use of cognitive heuristics will interact with political sophistication to predict higher quality decisions

### Method:

-   scrolling for info.

## Lupia, Arthur et al. 2007. "Were Bush Tax Supporters 'Simply Ignorant?' A Second Look at Conservatives and Liberals in 'Homer Gets a Tax Cut."' Perspectives on Politics. 5(4): 773-784.

### Abstract:

In a recent issue of Perspectives on Politics, Larry Bartels examines the high levels of support for tax cuts signed into law by President Bush in 2001. In so doing, he characterizes the opinions of "ordinary people" as lacking "a moral basis" and as being based on "simple-minded and sometimes misguided considerations of self interest." He concludes that "the strong plurality support for Bush's tax cut ... is entirely attributable to simple ignorance."

Our analysis of the same data reveals different results. We show that for a large and politically relevant class of respondents, conservatives and Republicans, rising information levels increase support for the tax cuts. In fact, Republican respondents rated "most informed" supported the tax cuts at extraordinarily high levels (over 96 percent). For these citizens, Bartels' claim that "better-informed respondents were much more likely to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut" is untrue. Bartels' results depend on the strong assumption that if more information about the tax cut makes liberals less likely to support it, then conservatives must follow suit. Our analysis allows groups to process information in different ways and can better help political entrepreneurs better reconcile critical social needs with citizens' desires.

### Question:

-   How does information acquisition (and to what level) influence support/opposition to policies?

-   Are voters stupid? RE: Bartels

### Bartels Argument:

-   Bartels claims that "better-informed respondents were much more likely to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut"

-   He argues that if Americans had been more enlightened, greater numbers would have opposed the cuts.

-   Bartels characterizes the opinions of "ordinary people" as being superficial and based on "simple-minded and sometimes misguided considerations of self-interest."

-   "Finally, and most importantly, better-informed respondents were much more likely to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut...If we take this crossectional difference in views as indicative of the effect of information on political preferences, it appears that the strong plurality for Bush's tax cut...is entirely attributable to simple ignorance."

### Authors argument:

-   They disagree with Bartels.

-   they agree regarding the role of information in determining how voters support or oppose policies.

-   They point to issues with 2002 NES survey.

    -   lower budget in this survey and thus less political information questions were asked.

        -   note: is political information questions = to political knowledge questions?

-   Both use post election interviewer ratings as an instrument for pre-election interviewer ratings to minimze the probability that the rating is contaminated by a respondent's answers to the tax cut and inequality questions, where were asked in the pre-election survey.

-   They find: for Republicans/conservatives with higher information ratings had no significant effect on support for the tax cut or correspond to increase support for cuts.

-   For Dem/liberal - the claim that better informed respondents were much more liekly to express negative views about the 2001 tax cut is simply untrue.

-   Bartels conclusion rests on an assumption he makes about how information impacts public opinion:

    -   He restricts *all respondents*---whether liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat---to respond to increasing information levels in an *identical way.* Must changes in information levels have such universal effects? Or is it possible that on issues such as the merit of a tax cut proposal, reasonable people can disagree?

        -   Bartels assumes all respondents must respond identically to the added info.

            -   Authors: "but often in politics, and perhaps distinctively in politics, there is a **clash of perspectives, values, and views about how society works.**

                -   there is also a cognitive element going on that isn't being discussed. I am thinking of a taber & lodge angle to this.

### Authors findings/theory:

-   Very few respondents scored below average on political information scale.

-   As republicans achieve higher information scores, their support for the tax cut increases.

    -   this result is flipped and more stark for democrats.

-   Bartels claims that ignorance explains the overwhelming support for the tax cuts. [Figure 2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/were-bush-tax-cut-supporters-simply-ignorant-a-second-look-at-conservatives-and-liberals-in-homer-gets-a-tax-cut/F9166CE739ED62C5C8E243D7A9150539#fig002) suggests a different story. For liberals, higher information ratings correspond to more tax cut opposition. For conservatives, the same is not true.

-   Bartels findings are based on an assumption about information that is questionable as a general matter and is falsified by the data.

-   Did Bartels just not separate out the data between Republicans and Democrats?

-   1 = strongly support tax cut, .5 = support tax cut -.5 = oppose tax cut, -1 = strongly oppose tax cut.

-   Bartels makes an a priori assumption about how different partisan and ideological groups should react to different amounts of information.

-   They run separate regressions for liberals and conservatives.

-   In columns 3 through 6, increasing information ratings makes liberals and Democrats less likely to support the tax cut. However, higher information ratings have no significant effect on conservative or Republican support for the tax cut. Put another way, reasonable people (e.g., highly informed liberals and highly informed conservatives) can disagree---and in this case they did. Only liberals react as Bartels predicts. Other respondents react quite differently.

-   They don't think Bartels' description of citizens as "simple-minded", "unenlightened", "superficial" etc. is not the best.

    -   no single agreed upon axiom for economics or policy to be "correct"

    -   respondents don't just think about one policy.

    -   just because people don't have opinions of tax cuts does not mean they are simple minded.

-   Some considerable pushback about voters being solely economic driven.

-   They take issue with Bartels' conclusions on voters.

# Week 4: Ideology/Sophistication

## Lecture Notes:

-   The broad question (in my POV) is about if, when, and why do people have constraints on their belief system

    -   this is the throughline (so far).

-   we are seeing a pattern through all this research on the masses.

    -   the most sophisticated at every level are influenced the most in general.

        -   they use heuristics better

        -   they are more interested

        -   more constraints

        -   more active

        -   etc.

            -   nothing seems to move the bottom of the masses.

-   What moves the lower strata politically

    -   what does the lower strata even think?

    -   what brings them into the political process.

-   Are voters making right decisions?

    -   do they know what they are doing?

-   Thinking about top-down elite info transfer.

-   tourangeau et al. is good.

-   executive functioning(?)

-   Opinions: verbal expression of an attitude

    -   attitude: an enduring predisposition to respond

## [Achen, C.H. 1975. "Mass Political Attitudes and the Survey Response." American Political Science Review. 69: 1218-31.](https://www-jstor-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/stable/1955282?seq=1)

### Abstract:

Students of public opinion research have argued that voters show very little consistency and structure in their political attitudes. A model of the survey response is proposed which takes account of the vagueness in opinion survey questions and in response categories. When estimates are made of this vagueness or "measurement error" and the estimates applied to the principal previous study, nearly all the inconsistency is shown to be the result of the vagueness of the questions rather than of any failure by the respondents.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   Survey design can lead to different results!

-   Also, Converse missed some important methods considerations.

### Research Question:

-   What are possible sources for why there is weak correlation among citizens' political survey responses?

### Background/Theory:

-   "There can be little doubt that the sophisticated electorates postulated by some of the more enthusiastic democratic theorists do not exist, even in the best educated modern societies"

-   Beliefs may be best expressed on a continuum.

-   We use likert scales but these are discrete representations of a continuous preference.

    -   As a result, it is unsurprising this leads to respondents appear to be inconsistent in their beliefs.

        -   We usually just chalk this up as measurement error

            -   Achen: "**...it reflects a flaw in the survey research method rather than in responses of subjects."**

                -   He argues Converse did not contend with these issues and thus underestimates voters' attitudinal stability.

-   There are two theories about instability in respondents political survey questions:

    -   1\) voters actually have instability in their opinions/belief system.

        -   This is Converse's argument

    -   2\) low reliabilities of opinion survey question

        -   This is Achen's argument contribution.

-   BIG ISSUE FOR ACHEN: the vagueness of the questions asked.

### Data/Method:

-   Converse's data

-   1132 respondents

-   "When a voter is stable in his views and all observed variability is measurement error, correlations will be equal across time periods. At the other extreme, when a voter is unstable and there is *no* measurement error, correlations should become smaller at a predictable rate as time periods become more distant from each other."

    -   Basically:

        -   smaller correlations between periods means genuine changes in belief.

            -   time 1 should NOT have more predictive power than time 2 for time 3

        -   consistent beliefs means that time 1 or time 2 should not be better than the other at predicting time 3.

            -   correlation is equal across time periods!

-   I am a bit confused by the model - $p_t$ represents the actual opinion at time t of the respondent. But we cannot know this? We only have the observed opinion represented at $x_t$

### Results:

-   Voters' beliefs are a bit more stable than we thought

    -   **this does not mean voters have more wisdom.**

-   This article says nothing about a voter's sophistication

    -   only that there beliefs are a bit more stable than what Converse initially articulated.

-   "Here the problem with the weak original correlations is demonstrated to lie, not with the variability of respondents, but rather with the fuzziness of the questions and with other errors of measurement."

-   This only works for panel data I think.

-   The simplicity of questions and the fact that respondents might have preferneces on a continuum that don't perfectly map onto the likert scale categories that might be driving this "measurement error."

    -   Need to figure this out.

        -   how does the question get interpreted by different individual factors?

            -   measurement error is DV

            -   IV = independent variables - Education/income.

                -   should expect "better-off" members of the electorate to have lower expected measurement errors.

                -   there are a lot more IVs.

    -   However, they find that these individual factors have little to no predictive power in explaining measurement error. ACCORDING to R\^2

        -   WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT r\^2. Author says the same thing

    -   Factors that are are significant: *note their coefficient (effect) is still quite small.*

        -   taking an interest in the campaign

        -   caring who wins

        -   talking to others about it

            -   city dweller is not a significant variable

                -   keep this in your backpocket for your research.

        -   higher education

        -   income

        -   occupational status

-   **The well-informed and interested have nearly as much difficulty with the questions as does the ordinary man. Measurement error is primarily a fault of the instruments, not of the respondent**

## Converse, P. 1964. "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics." In Apter, ed. Ideology and Discontent. New York: The Free Press.\*

### Chapter Reading: The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics

-   Focus: measurement strategies for belief systems.

    -   "**Our focus in this article is upon differences in the nature of belief systems held on the one hand by elite political actors and, on the other, by the masses that appear to be "numbered" within the spheres of influence of these belief systems.**

-   Thesis: **There are important and predictable differences in ideational worlds as we progress downward through such "belief strata" and that these differences, while obvious at one level, are easily overlooked and not infrequently miscalculated.**

-   They don't like "ideology"

-   **Belief System:** a configuration of ideas and attitudes in which the elements are bound together by some form of constraint or functional interdependence.

-   **Constraint:** the success we would have in predicting, given initial knowledge that an individual holds a specified attitude, that he holds certain further ideas and attitudes.

    -   basically logical constraint is what they are getting at.

        -   but there are others.

-   **Centrality:** idea elements within a belief system vary in a property we shall call "centrality", according to the role that they play in the belief system as a whole.

### II. Sources of Constraint on Idea-Elements

-   logical inconsistencies are far more prevalent in broad public.

-   classical logic: if x then y. or this must follow if z.

#### Psychological Sources of Constraint

-   not classically logical.

-   Seems to be driving at a sort of cultural constraint.

-   the "logic of culture". morals/ethics

-   "What is important is that the elites familiar with the total shapes of these belief systems have *experienced* them as logically constrained clusters of ideas, within which on part necessarily follows from another."

#### Social Sources of Constraint

-   "In the case of the belief system, arguments are developed to lend some more positive rationale to the fact of constraint: The idea-elements go together not simply because both are in the interest of the person holding a particular status but for more abstract and quasi-logical reasons developed from a coherent world view as well. It is this type of constraint that is closest. to the classic meaning of the term"ideology".

-   Second source of social constraint: idea elements of a belief system are diffused in packages.

    -   "if you believe this, then you will also believe that, for it follows in such and such ways"

    -   "communists are atheists" - a lot of people would believe this but wouldn't coherently be able to tell you why.

-   Diffusion of information

    -   different levels of info.

        -   most get the first level which is just the statement

        -   however, most won't get the contextual information to support the claim. the "why"

    -   information is super important. How it trickles down but also how different people consume it!

#### Consequences of Declining Information for Belief Systems

-   **Primary Thesis: as one moves from elite sources of belief systems downwards on such an information scale, several important things occur:**

    -   1\) the contextual grasp of "standard" political belief system fades out very rapidly.

        -   constraints decline across the universe of idea-elements.

    -   2\) The character of objects that are central in a belief system undergoes systematic change.

        -   these objects shift from the remote, generic, and abstract to the increasingly simple, concrete, or "close to home".

        -   Interest paragraph - i don't know if I buy this:

            -   "Such observations have impressed even those investigators who are dealing with subject matter rather close to the individual's immediate world: his family budgeting, what he thinks of people more wealthy than he, his attitudes toward leisure time, work regulations, and the like. But most of the stuff of politics-particularly that played on a national or international stage- is, in the nature of things, remote and abstract. Where politics is concerned, therefore, such ideational changes begin to occur rapidly below the extremely thin stratum of the electorate that ever has occasion to make public pronouncements on political affairs. In other words, the changes in belief systems of which we speak are not a pathology limited to a thin and disoriented bottom layer of the *lumpenproletariat;* they are immediately relevant in understanding the bulk of mass political behavior." p.213 towards the bottom.

### III. Active Use of Ideological Dimensions of Judgment.

-   Different levels:

    -   ideologue

        -   respondents who did indeed rely in some active way on a relatively abstract and far-reaching conceptual dimension as a yardstick which political objects and their shifting policy significance over time were evaluated.

    -   semi-ideologue

        -   respondents who mentioned such a dimension in a peripheral way but did not appear to place much evaluative dependence upon it or who used such concepts in a fashion that raised doubt about the breadth of their understand of the meaning of the term.

    -   Group interest

        -   respondents who failed to. rely upon any such over-arching dimensions yet evaluated parties and candidates in terms of their expected favorable or unfavorable treatment of different social groups in the population.

    -   Nature of the times

        -   democrats made economy bad i vote republican now.

    -   Nonsensical

        -   voters who just said random stuff basically.

### V. Constraints among Idea-Elements.

-   more sophisticated = more constraints.

-   mass public does not share ideological patterns of belief with relevant elites at a specific level any more than it shares the abstract conceptual frames of reference.

### VI. Social Groupings as Central Objects in Belief Systems

-   Differences in the objects that have centrality in a belief system.

-   for bulk of mass public, the object with highest centrality is the visible.

    -   interesting point. I think this is still true.

-   "it might be deduced that nationalist ideologies stand a much better chance of penetrating a mass population than would...for nationalist ideologies hinge upon a simple group object in a way that single-tax notions do not. p.237

-   The nation as a bounded, integral group object is difficult to experience in any direct way, and its psychological existence for the individual depends upon the social transmission of certain kinds of information.

    -   reminds me of Benedict Anderson - imagined communities.

#### Other Info

-   the most active and hardcore does not mean sophisticated!

-   "Nonetheless, persistent and varied participation is most heavily concentrated among the most sophisticated people. This fact is important, for much of what is perceived as"public reaction" to political events depends upon public visibility, and visibility ddpends largely upon forms of political participation beyond the vote itself." p.226

-   The "visible" or "operative" public is largely made up of people from the upper left-hand corner of our preceding tables. The illusion that such people are the full public is one that the democratic sample survey, for better or for worse, has destroyed.

-   "For the truly involved citizen, the development of political sophistication means the absorption of contextual information that makes clear to him the connections of the policy area of his initial interest with policy differences in other areas; and that these broader configurations of policy positions are describable quite economically in the basic abstractions of ideology. Most members of the mass public, however, fail to proceed so far."

-   The common citizen fails to develop more global points of view about politics.

## Freeder et al. 2019. "The Importance of Knowing"What Goes with What": Reinterpreting the Evidence on Policy Attitude Stability." Journal of Politics. 81(1).

### Abstract:

What share of citizens hold meaningful views about public policy? Despite decades of scholarship, researchers have failed to reach a consensus. Researchers agree that policy opinions in surveys are unstable but disagree about whether that instability is real or just measurement error. In this article, we revisit this debate with a concept neglected in the literature: knowledge of which issue positions "go together" ideologically---or what Philip Converse called knowledge of "what goes with what." Using surveys spanning decades in the United States and the United Kingdom, we find that individuals hold stable views primarily when they possess this knowledge and agree with their party. These results imply that observed opinion instability arises not primarily from measurement error but from instability in the opinions themselves. We find many US citizens lack knowledge of "what goes with what" and that only about 20%--40% hold stable views on many policy issues.

### Bumper Sticker:

### Research Question:

-   What share of citizens hold meaningful views about public policy?

-   What is the source of instability in survey measures of the public's policy opinions?

### Hypothesis:

-   The knowledge of what goes with what plays an important and under-appreciated role in attitude stability.

    -   When people learn what goes with what (which policy positions are Republican and which are Democratic), they will tend to exhibit stable policy views.

-   Those who do not know elite positions should generally have less stable views, even when we measure their attitudes with multi-item scales.

### Background/Theory:

-   Debate in lit about question

-   Zaller & Zaller & Feldman argued that opinion instability results from citizens holding conflicting considerations on policy issues and then sampling from these pools of inconsistent considerations when they answer survey questions.

-   Others argue (Achen) that people do hold meaningful opinions but is ambiguous due to measurement error.

-   If citizens lack meaningful views about even the most salient political issues, instead having their opinionsontheseissueseasilychangedbypoliticalelites and the media, "democratic theory loses its starting point" (Achen 1975, 1220).

-   In this article, we show that this long line of research has yielded mixed results because it has examined opinion stability by general political knowledge, a poor proxy for what we believe drives attitude stability.

    -   what goes with what

-   People adopt the heuristics and follow the leaders

    -   very top-down driven mechanism for attitude stability.

### Data/Method:

### Results:

-   We find that a large segment of the public lacks knowledge of "what goes with what," and consequently a large segment lacks stable policy views on salient issues. Relatedly, we find that those who do possess this knowledge tend to have stable views, but only when they agree with the views of their party.

## Huckfeldt, Levine, Morgan and Sprague. 1999. "Accessibility and the Utility of Partisan Ideological Orientations." American Journal of Political Science. 43(3): 888-912.

### Abstract:

We examine the accessibility of ideological and partisan orientations as factors affecting the political capacity of citizens. In particular, is the utility of partisan and ideological reasoning contingent on the accessibility of an individual's own self-identifications? Are people with accessible points of ideological and partisan orientation more likely to in voke these orientations in formulating political judgments and resisting efforts at political persuasion? Are they more likely to demonstrate politically compatible points of orientation? These questions are addressed in the context of a study conducted during the course of the 1996 election campaign. In order to measure the accessibility of respondents' partisan and ideological self-identifications, we record response latencies-the time re quired for respondents to answer particular questions. Based on our analysis, we argue that attitudes and self identifications are useful heuristic devices that allow individuals to make sense out of the complexity and chaos of politics. But some citizens are better able than others to employ these devices, and by demonstrating who these citizens are, the concept of accessibility becomes an important element in the explanation of political capacity.

### Research Question

1.  What is the key to the political capacity of citizens?

2.  Are ideological and partisan orientations only important for those individuals who are able to distinguish themselves as strong partisans or strong ideologues, at the extreme points of the respective scales?

3.  Is the utility of partisan and ideological reasoning contingent on the accessibility of an individual;s own self-identifications? Are people with accessible points of orientation more likely to invoke partisanship and ideology in formulating political judgments and resisting efforts at political persuasion? Are they more likely to demonstrate politically compatible points of orientation?

4.  Does everyone possess a library of heuristic devices to use in uncertain circumstances? Under what circumstances is such a device likely to be most useful?

5.  How might an individual confront government support for the arts *absent* such an ideological orientation?

### Hypothesis:

-   Our argument is that the political relevance and heuristic utility of an attitude or an identification is directly related to its accessibility in the memory of an individual.

-   Such ideological orientations become more useful if they readily come to mind when an individual confronts a situation requiring a political decision or judgment.

### Background:

-   The explicit or implicit lesson has been that strong ideologues and strong partisans are better able to exercise the duties of citizenship because they are better able to invoke clear principles when tthey are confronted with complex political issues.

-   Converse:

    -   1\) many citizens do not think in ideological terms

    -   2\) many demonstrate a high level of temporal instability in their opinions

    -   3\) many hold inconsistent opinions on seemingly related issues.

-   Questions have shifted to asking what manner can incapable citizens are able to reach political decisions.

-   **accessible opinions, identitifications, and orientations are distinguished by their position within long-term memory.**

    -   they are accessible because they are readily and easily available within individual cognitive structures (or schemas), and hence they are readily retrieved.

### Data/Methods

-   previous studies have measured accessibility through the latency of the answer.

    -   how long did it take the individual to answer the question - tracked through mouse/click time.

        -   the latency is the measure of accessibility.

-   Data: 1996 election campaign

-   2 samples

    -   sample one: n = 2174

    -   and a one stage snowball sample of these main respondents' discussants n = 1475

        -   drawn from the indianapolis metro area

        -   st louis metro area

-   25 min interview

-   timed using latent timer which recorded the elapsed time between answers to two sequenced questions.

### Results:

-   Citizens who readily think about politics in partisan or ideological terms are better able to employ these points of orientation as useful heuristic devices in making sense out of the complexity and chaos of politics.

-   In contrast to a model of online processing, our analysis builds on the idea that some citizens are unable to provide affective responses to opinion objects, while others-citizens with accessible heuristics-are able to for mulate responses on the spot using these heuristic devices

## Lau, R. and D. Redlawsk. 1997. "Voting Correctly." American Political Science Review. 91(3): 585-98.

### Abstract:

The average voter falls far short of the prescriptions of classic democratic theory in terms of interest, knowledge, and participation in politics. We suggest a more realistic standard: Citizens fulfill their democratic duties if most of the time, they vote "correctly." Relying on an operationalization of correct voting based on fully informed interests, we present experimental data showing that, most of the time, people do indeed manage to vote correctly. We also show that voters' determinations of their correct vote choices can be predicted reasonably well with widely available survey data. We illustrate how this measure can be used to determine the proportion of the electorate voting correctly, which we calculate at about 75% for the five American presidential elections between 1972 and 1988. With a standard for correct vote decisions, political science can turn to exploring the factors that make it more likely that people will vote correctly.

## Zaller, J. and s. Feldman. 1992. "A Simple Model of the Survey Response: Answering Questions versus Revealing Preferences." American Journal of Political Science. 36: 579-616.

### Abstract:

Opinion research is beset by two major types of "artifactual" variance: huge amounts of overtime response instability and the common tendency for seemingly trivial changes in questionnaire form to affect the expression of attitudes. We propose a simple model that converts this anomalous "error variance" into sources of substantive insight into the nature of public opinion. The model abandons the conventional but implausible notion that most people possess opinions at the level of specificity of typical survey items-and instead assumes that most people are internally conflicted over most political issues-and that most respond to survey questions on the basis of whatever ideas are at the top of their heads at the moment of answering. Numerous empirical regularities are shown to be consistent with these assumptions.

### Bumper Sticker

Voters do not (for the most part) have preformed attitudes and make it up when confronted on a survey.

### Research Question:

-   How sophisticated are voters?

-   Are they consistent?

-   Do surveys properly capture sophistication?

-   How do we develop a model that accommodates both response instability and response effects and that is crafted to the kinds of problems and data facing analysts of public opinion?

-   According to conventional attitude theory, individuals choose whichever prespecified option comes closest to their own position. But if, as we contend, people typically do not have fixed positions on issues, how do they make their choices?

### Hypothesis/Argument:

-   Most citizens, we argue, simply do not possess preformed attitudes at the level of specificity demanded in surveys.

    -   They carry around in their heads a mix of only partially consistent ideas and considerations.

        -   when questioned, they call to mind a sample of these ideas, including an oversample of ideas made salient by the questionnaire and the other recent events, and use them to choose among the options offered . But their choices do not, in most cases, reflect anything that can be described as true attitudes; rather, they reflect the thoughts that are most accessible in memory at the moment of response.

-   The heart of our argument is that for most people, most of the time, there is no need to reconcile or even to recognize their contradictory reactions to events and issues.

    -   each represents a a genuine feeling, capable of coexisting with opposing feelings and, depending on its salience in the person's mind.

### Context/previous research:

-   citizens don't have very well informed attitudes. some debate of this. see Achen and Converse.

-   People are inconsistent in survey responses over time. Why?

-   Converse argues large portions of an electorate do not have meaningful beliefs even, even on issues that have formed the basis for intense political controversy among elites for substantial periods of time.

    -   Achen disagrees a bit.

        -   they are stable but there is error as a result of survey design/issues.

            -   mapping true attitudes to vague langue of survey questions is hard.

-   Achen assumes that all respondents have "true attitudes"

-   Question ordering influences all levels of respondent.

-   Surveys frame issues and make certain things salient.

-   Hochschild particularly emphasizes ambivalence in many of her respondents

    -   this ambivalence is interesting.

        -   they are being probed for the opinion but the ambivalence shows the need for a discourse to reach a conclusion.

-   a **schema** is a cognitive structure that organizes prior information and experience around a central value or idea and that guides the interpretation of new information and experience

    -   this kind of sounds like a belief system or at least closely related.

-   **Zaller's model will follow the assumption of ambivalence in people's political beliefs.**

### Axioms

1.  The ambivalence axiom. Most people possess opposing considerations on most issues, that is, considerations that might lead them to decide the issue either way.

2.  The response axiom. Individuals answer survey questions by averaging across the considerations that happen to be salient at the moment of response, where saliency is determined by the accessibility axiom.

3.  The accessibility axiom. The accessibility of any given consideration depends on a stochastic sampling process, where considerations that have been recently through about are somewhat more likely to be sampled.

### Deductions:

1.  We should find that people are, in general, more politically involved have more considerations at the top of their heads and available for use in answering survey questions.

2.  we would expect persons who have greater interest in an issue to have, all else equal, more thoughts about that issue readily accessible in memory than other persons.

    1.  dont have good data for this but have some

3.  We should find strong correlations between measures of people's thoughts as they answer a survey item and the direction of decision on the item itself.

4.  If as the model claims, individuals possess competing considerations on most issues, and if they answer on the basis of whatever ideas happen to be at the top of their minds at the moment of response, one would expect a fair amount of over-time instability in people's attitude reports.

5.  Citizens would have central tendencies that are stable over time, but their attitude statements would fluctuate greatly around these central tendencies.

6.  Attitude reports formed from an average of many considerations will be more reliable indicator of the underlying population of considerations than an average based on just on one or two considerations

7.  People should be more stable in their responses to close-ended policy items conserning doorstep issues-that is, issues so close to everyday concerns that most people routinely give some thought to them.

8.  Greater ambivalence ought to be associated with higher levels of response instability.

9.  If, as the model claims, people are normally ambivalent on issues but answer on the basis of whatever ideas are most accessible at the moment of answering, raising new considerations in immediate proximity to a question should be able to affect the answers given by making different considerations salient.

10. Most ambivalent - are the people that should be most strongly affected by artificial changes in question order.

11. The tendency of people to base attitude reports on the ideas that are most immediately salient to them, as specified in Axioms 2 and 3, well explains such effects.

12. race of interviewer effects

13. reference group effects

14. priming effects of television news

15. framing effects of question wording and question order

16. Having had their ideological orientations made salient to them just prior to answering policy items, those respondents who possess such orientations are more likely to rely on them as a considerations in formulating responses to subsequent policy questions, thereby making those responses more strongly correlated with their ideological positions and hence also more ideologically consistent with one another.

17. We therefor expected that responses following the stop-and-think treatment would be, all else equal, more reliable indicators of the set of underlying considerations than responses made in the standard way, that is, in the retrospective condition.

    1.  struggle to confirm this one.

### Results/Findings:

-   The conflicts most responsible for response instability is conflict that occurs across rather than within interviews and that respondents are often unaware of their conflict as they answer questions.

### Other:

-   mention of the "on-line" model/ people use a judgment operator to update continuously their attitudes "on-line" as they acquire new information.

    -   People are said to store their updated attitudes in long-term memory and retrieve them as required, rather than, as in our model, create attitude statements on the spot as they confront each new survey question.

        -   They are still skeptical about this because citizens must answer such a large variance of questions on survey for the on-line processing of all relevant information.

### Abstract:

The study of citizens' trust in the national government has been primarily individual-level, cross-sectional analysis. In the cur rent research, we develop a quarterly time series measure of trust in the U.S. national government from 1980 to 1997 and conduct the first multivariate time series examination of public trust in government. We find that negative perceptions of the economy, scandals associated with Congress, and increasing public concern about crime each lead to de clining public trust in government. Declining trust in government in turn leads to less positive evaluations of Congress and reduced support for government action to address a range of domestic policy concerns. These results provide new evidence of the influence of public concern about crime and the centrality of Congress in understanding public evaluations of the national government and new evidence of how de clining levels of trust in government may influence elections and do mestic policy making.

### Bumper Sticker

-   we find that trust in government is importantly influenced by political scandals and public perceptions of the economy and crime

### Question:

-   What are the causes in the variation of public trust?

### Hypothesis:

1.  We hypothesize that as the proportion of the public mentioning crime as the nation's most important problem rises, trust in government will fall.

    1.  i am thinking about suburbia. I wonder if they are concerned about crime in other places and then that colors their perception of crime around them.

2.  We expect that as the public concern about international affairs increases, support for governmental authority will increase in the form of greater trust and approval

    1.  reminding me a bit about the role of anxiety and fear.

3.  We expect both congressional and presidential scandals to have a negative effect on public trust.

4.  trust rises and falls with the economy.

### Background/Theory:

-   We need trust in government for political leaders to make binding decisions, commit resources to attain societal goals, and secure citizen compliance without coercion.

-   declining trust a result of the political system/regime or a dissatisfaction with incumbent political leaders.

-   distrust can lead to voters increasing support for devolution of decision making from federal to state governments on issues such as crime, welfare, and the environment.

-   Trust hits a high point under Reagan.

    -   i wonder about trust vis-a-vis legitimacy.

-   approval correlates with trust.

    -   this also flows the other way though.

-   declining trust will make the public less willing to support increases in federal government spending and activity in the domestic policy arena.

-   exogenous:

    -   sociotropic prospections of voters has been shown to be a strong determinant of gov. approval.

    -   favorable econ expectations will lead to greater trust.

    -   MIP Crime - this is a quarterly measure of the proportion of the public who identify crime as the most important problem facing the nation.

        -   "what do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?

        -   previous measures have used homicide rate. Authors don't use this.

            -   citizens subjective perceptions of crime rather than object levels of crime.

            -   measure taps public concern regarding all crimes and not just homicide.

    -   Public concern about international affairs.

    -   scandals

### Method:

-   time series

-   Vector autoregression

    -   3 time series

        -   time series in conversation.

-   2 year intervals of trust questions.

-   MIP Crime

-   MIP International.

    -   quarterly measure of the proportion of the public who identify international concerns as the most important problem facing the nation.

-   scandals

    -   dummy variable for pres/congressional scandals.

        -   congressional scandals

            -   Jim Wright scandal

            -   Keating Five scandal

            -   House Banking scandal

            -   Post Office scandal.

        -   Presidental scandals

            -   Iran-Contra

            -   White House Travel Office firings

            -   Whitewater

            -   Filegate

### Results:

-   results show trust does rise and fall with the economy.

-   As the proportion of the public mentioning crime as the most important problem facing the nation rises, trust in government declines.

-   MIP International variable fails to reach statistical significance.

-   Presidential scandal variable does not attain statistical significance.

-   congressional scandal is statistically significant.

-   "Consistent with the contention that trust in the federal government is more closely tied to trust in Congress than to trust in the president."

-   congressional scandals hurt trust more than presidential scandals.

-   approval rating doesn't really move the needle on trust.

    -   they think trust -\> increases approval rating.

        -   they dont find evidence that trust in government drives presidential approval.

        -   for congress however, they find as trust increases, so does congressional approval.

            -   trust is more closely tied to congress.

-   We find that in addition to past values of policy mood itself, policy mood is driven by both trust and presidential approval.

    -   greater support for the president yields greater support for government action regardless of the party affiliation of the president.

-   "Our research finds that evaluations of Congress and congressional scandals are more closely linked to trust in government than are evaluations of the president and presidential scandals.

## Gibson, J. 1992. "The Political Consequences of Intolerance: Cultural Conformity and Political Freedom." APSR. 86(2): 338-356.

### other:

-   Gibson is really giving a strong argument for context and macro-level effects.

-   why care about political tolerance?

    -   without a culture that legitimizes political opposition, those outside the centrist mainstream have few political opportunities.

        -   the loss of respect for dissent and nonconformity in nominally democratic regimes is perhaps one of the greatest threats to political freedom

-   This is all very mutz, gibson, Bishop, etc.

### Abstract:

I demonstrate that the intolerance of ordinary citizens matter for real politics even if strong linkages to policy outputs do not exist. In particular, the model I test posits that cultural intolerance constrains the liberty of individual citizens. Focusing on how people perceive political freedom, several hypotheses coupling tolerance and freedom are explored. Data from a national survey show that toderance and freedom are connected. Those who do not feel free to express themselves politically are more likely to be intolerant of others, to have less heterogenous peer groups and less tolerant spouses, and to live in less tolerant communities. Ultimately, the importance of mass political intolerance in the United States is that it establishes a culture of conformity that seems to constrain individual political liberty in many important ways.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   "There is a strong suggestion of a close connection between how people think about their own freedom and what freedom they would grant to their political enemies, as well as some more inferential evidence of a linkage between cultural intolerance and perceived limits on political freedom."

### Question:

1.  How does intolerance in U.S. mass political culture influence politics?

2.  "It is worthwhile to consider other mechanisms through which mass political intolerance matters for politics."

3.  Does intolerance contribute to restrictions on freedom, self-censorship, and political conformity?

    1.  does cultural intolerance inhibit freedom?

4.  How strongly does the political culture of the United States encourage and reward conformity and discourage and penalize political nonconformity?

5.  To what degree do tolerance and perceptions of political freedom go together? Do those who are intolerant perceive more limited freedom for themselves?

    1.  those who are more tolerant perceiving less political repression.

    2.  those who are more tolerant are also less likely to engage in self-censorship.

6.  To what extent the intolerance of a spouse contributes to perceptions that freedom is best not exercised.

7.  To what degree is intolerance of the community reflected in the intolerance of the individual respondent?

    1.  is there an endogeneity issue here?

### Hypothesis:

1.  Intolerance matters for politics by constraining the freedom available to ordinary citizens.

2.  People learn from the political culture that intolerance is widespread, that it is acceptable, and that there are tangible risks to asserting views that the intolerant culture finds objectionable.

3.  I expect that more political freedom is perceived where these environments are more tolerant and that the environments are the most tolerant when they are the most diverse politically.

    1.  approaching mutz/sorting.

4.  Mass political intolerance creates a culture of conformity and that this culture significantly affects citizens' perceptions of the freedom that is available to them.

5.  I hypothesize that greater exposure to political diversity is associated with greater political tolerance and with a greater sense of political freedom.

6.  I hypothesize that the political intolerance of a spouse has something to do with how one percieves political freedom.

### Background/Theory:

-   mass political tolerance is not a prerequisite to democratic government.

    -   Gibson is setting up the "so what?"

        -   if intolerant people still can exist under democracy, should we care?

-   *perceived political freedom -* how people view the availability of liberty.

-   The *elitist* theory of democracy - this theory accepts as an empirical fact the intolerance of the mass public but argues that under most circumstances this intolerance is neutralized. Except under extraordinary political conditions, the antidemocratic mass public is immobilized by its own ignorance and apathy, leaving the relatively more democratic elite free to rule in a democratic fashion.

-   we shouldn't just look at the influence of intolerance of on public policy but also on other matters of politics.

-   "The political relevance of political intolerance, then, can be found in the constraints on political thought and action that citizens impose upon each other.

-   Gibson is basing tolerance off of environmental factors of the individual

    -   Macro: larger social and political community within which the respondent resides

    -   Micro: made up of the specific friendship and family groups relevant for the respondent.

-   Tolerance - opposition to state actions that limit opportunities for citizens, individual or in groups, to compete for political power.

-   Little support for full civil liberties for unpopular political minorities.

-   perceived freedom!

    -   survey question of how free do you think you are?

-   To understand perception of personal political freedom we need to be sensitive to constraints emanating from the larger political system as well as from the personal network of the individual.

-   Blacks are much more likely to perceive constraints on their freedom than are whites.

-   Large portions of the population are fearful of public expression of unpopular political views.

-   Tolerance of others is associated with the belief that there are few significant costs to be paid for one's own political self-expression.

-   **one of the most important attributes of the micro environments of individuals is diversity.**

    -   as one is exposed to a greater range of political ideas, one can be come aware that alternative viewpoints are possible and legitimate and that one's own view may not be absolutely correct

        -   Very Mutz/Big Sort stuff.

            -   kinda reminding me of the paper i wrote for Josh in core.

### Results:

-   When political discussion is common within the peer group and the peer group is composed of members with differing party identifications, blacks become significantly less likely to engage in behavioral self-censorship or to perceive governmental constraints on their freedom.

-   a large portion of Americans perceive little political freedom

-   there are considerable racial differences in perceived freedom

-   Peer group diversity thus. contributes to greater perceived freedom

    -   remember this is from a name generator of close individuals.

        -   peer groups!

-   Men with less tolerant wives tend to have fewer and less open political discussions at home, but their overall levels of perceived freedom are little affected.

-   Now we need to figure out community level intolerance. this is hard.

-   **among both blacks and whites, those living in more tolerant communities are considerably more likely to perceive political freedom.**

-   "**More important are the findings connecting perceptions of freedom and intolerance. Not only are those who are intolerant more likely to perceive constraints on their own freedom, but I have also adduced evidence that intolerance in the external environment contributes to a lack of perceived freedom. More homogeneous (and presumably less tolerant) peer groups, less tolerant spouses, and less tolerant local communities all seem to limit how much freedom ordinary Americans perceive. One reason why perceived freedom is so low seems to be that intolerance is so pervasive within American political culture.**

### Abstract:

Faced with a choice between John McCain and Barack Obama, voters in 2008 were swayed by the familiar play of factors---party identification, policy preferences, and economic conditions---but also, we find, by ethnocentrism, a deep-seated psychological predisposition that partitions the world into ingroups and outgroups---into "us" and "them." The effect of ethnocentrism was significant and substantial, and it appeared over and above the effects due to partisanship, economic conditions, policy stances, political engagement, and several varieties of conservatism. Two features of Obama were primarily responsible for triggering ethnocentrism in 2008: his race and his imagined Muslim faith. As such, we demonstrate that ethnocentrism was much more important in 2008 than in the four presidential elections immediately preceding 2008, and we show that it was much more important in the actual contest between Senator McCain and Senator Obama than in a hypothetical contest between Senator McCain and Senator Clinton.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   Ethnocentrism can be activated by salient political events and people.

### Question:

-   What role did ethnocentrism play in the 2008 election?

### Hypothesis:

-   Ethnocentrism was activated because of Obama's race and religion.

### Background/Theory:

-   **Ethnocentrism - a deep-seated psychological predisposition that partitions the world into in-groups and outgroups - into "us" and "them."**

    -   this seems like an obvious "truth" - Tajfel(?) also Allport

    -   the technical name for this view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything.

-   Ethnocentrism is not racism

    -   eth is broader.

        -   but probably connected.

### Method:

-   focus on white individuals

    -   black support for Obama was nearly unanimous.

-   +1 means super ethnocentric.

-   0 means absence of ethnocentric.

-   -1 means outgroups are seen as virtuous and in groups as utterly without virtue.

### Results:

-   party id was the biggest factor in how people voted (obvious)

-   whites high on ethnocentrism were less likely to vote obama.

-   Independents were the most affected by ethnocentrism

    -   this is interesting!

-   ethnocentrism leads to racism.

-   ehtnocentrism was a major factor in 2008 but not other pres elections.

### Abstract:

Using a measure designed to capture intolerance on both sides of the political spectrum, I find that opinions favoring the abridgement of free speech rights are overwhelmingly targeted at right-leaning groups, and racist groups in particular. Consistent with recent studies, Democrats are found to be less tolerant than Republicans of speech they dislike. However, contrary to existing findings, the same patterns of intolerance are present for both racist and nonracist target groups. Treating racist groups as an exception to the principle of free expression may have resulted in a spillover to intolerance of other disliked groups.

### Bumper Sticker

Democrats don't like racist groups

### Research Question:

### Hypothesis:

1.  As of the 2020s, having a college education will negatively predict tolerance of racist groups but positively predict tolerance of nonracist groups

2.  younger age will negatively predict tolerance of racist groups but positively predict tolereance of nonracist groups

3.  liberals/Democrats will persist in being more tolerant than conservatives/Republicans of speech by nonracist groups, but liberals/Democrats will be less tolerant than Republicans of free expression from racist groups.

4.  Democrats will be less tolerant of right-leaning groups than independents, and that, relative to Independents, Republicans will be less tolerant of left-leaning groups - even though respondents of both parties will choose their most disliked gorup.

5.  tolerance of right leaning groups and right leaning groups that exclude racists will be fundamentally different, with Democratic party identification more positively predicting tolerance of non-racist, right leaning groups than right-leaning groups that include racists.

6.  Democratic partisanship will more positively predict tolerance of nonracist, right-leaning groups tahn Republican partisanship will predict support for left-leaning groups.

7.  With respect to education, the realignment hypothesis suggests that a college education should predict tolerance, but only if the target groups are not racist, since racist speech was suggested to be an exception to the greater tolerance expected of the well-educated.

### Background/Theory:

-   Measurement of political tolerance

    -   GSS

-   the loss of communism as a threat is interesting.

### Method:

-   panel data

-   4 waves

-   n at each wave = 2891, 2601, 2952, 4124.

-   Use party identification rather ideological identification

-   2020-2022

### Results:

![Figure 1 Choice of Least-Liked Groups by Party Identification, October 2022](mutz_results.jpeg){width="636"}

-   To summarize, intolerance is now driven primarily by partisans, younger people, and those without college degrees.

-   **Republicans tend to be more tolerant of racist speech and less tolerant of speech from leftist groups, as one might expect. But Democrats today tend to be less tolerant of all kinds of speech they dislike, whether racist or not. This finding suggests a broader basis for opposition to free speech rights than previously supposed.**

-   Oxford handbooks are good places to go for primers on work.

-   US is not at the top in terms of trust.

-   Mark Heatherington good source.

### Defining and measuring trust and types of trust:

-   Does trust mean a credible commitment?

-   trust is hard to define.

-   **Trust: the belief that others will not deliberately or knowingly do us harm, if they can avoid it, and will look after out interest, if this is possible.**

    -   stability

    -   predictability

-   We don't trust or distrust

    -   it is a range.

-   Social trust vs. political trust.

    -   horizontal/interpersonal trust

    -   vertical trust.

-   trust in people vs trust in institutions

-   Granovetter's strength of weak ties.

### Measuring Trust:

-   Rosenberg scale is pretty reliable and valid measure of social trust.

-   trust loads heavily on strangers.

    -   is there a geographical divide in trust?

-   trust seems to be mostly enduring.

-   bad aspect of social capital.

-   Need for *generalized* trust. This is harder for bigger/urbanized countries.

-   Where does trust in strangers come from?

    -   three theories:

        -   Rational choice trust

            -   rational, tit-for-tat calculation

            -   economic interest

            -   man wants the best payoffs for themselves and will pursue that.

        -   Social-psychological

            -   trust is learned in childhood and becomes a personality trait

        -   societal

            -   social trust is based on daily experience of social relations

                -   not a mindset

### Political trust

-   individual level factors don't explain political trust very well

-   voluntary association engagement has a weak bearing on trust

-   3 big variables:

    -   good government (rule of law)

    -   national wealth and income equality

    -   ethnic homogeneity

## Pietryka, M, L. Santoro, and A.E. Sokhey. Working Paper (to be distributed).

### Abstract:

People are more tolerant when they encounter political disagreement in their social networks. However, research supporting this claim predates concerns over polarization and democratic backsliding---it does not consider partisan tolerance and focuses on interactions with close friends and family (core networks). We develop theory linking acquaintance networks to tolerance, and evaluate it using Cooperative Election Study modules. We contribute by: 1) measuring partisan tolerance, 2) assessing the relationship between partisan tolerance and the presence of (co-)opposing partisans in acquaintance networks, 3) comparing acquaintance and core network approaches, and 4) examining tolerance relationships under important conditions. We find that exposure to outpartisans predicts affirming the civil liberties of outpartisans. Notably, acquaintance results mirror established findings based on core networks, and relationships hold when individuals dislike or feel threatened by outpartisans. Our results suggest that cross-partisan exposure need not be intimate or extended to be democratically meaningful.

### Question/motivation

-   At this point we simply do not know whether casual exposure to disagreement via acquaintances operates similarly to (or differently from) sustained interactions experienced in core networks.

    -   **Instead of looking solely at individuals' exchanges with their stronger ("core") ties a la past efforts, we broaden the focus to whether exposure via more casual interpersonal interaction also has the potential to strengthen democratic functioning**

-   If political disagreement among close contacts is beneficial but all too rare (given structural constraints and processes of selection/avoidance), casual exposure to political disagreement may be a remedy that is further-reaching and harder for people to circumvent.

### Hypothesis:

-   exposure to outpartisans should predict higher levels of political tolerance for opposing partisans, while exposure to inpartisans should drive in the opposite direction

### Background/Theory

-   Mutz is largely seen as correct in cross-cutting relationships.

-   benefits if interpersonal connections was being discussed at the same time as the debate over the masses polarization.

-   But while other efforts have considered a left-right range of groups and looked at how the granting of tolerance varies by partisanship we prioritize the outcome of partisan tolerance, asking respondents about protecting the freedoms of outpartisans.

    -   recall mutz just used democratic/republican allegiance

-   Gibson (1992) concluded that Americans in "less heterogeneous" networks were less politically tolerant.

-   Thus, while standard name generators yield valuable information, their practical limitations mean information is necessarily "right-censored"---after all, many people have more than 3-5 people with whom they talk politics or important matters

    -   While name generators regularly underestimate the size of individuals' core networks, a more serious issue is that by design they also miss people's casual exposures to political difference; they do not capture the contacts that might be "less relationally close and less frequent discussion partners"

        -   name generators are not weak ties.

            -   right?

-   Why should we expect interpersonal political disagreement to foster political tolerance in the first place?

    -   With respect to more affective components, intimate relationships across lines of political difference---like those found in the "strong ties" of core networks---may help individuals develop affinity for members of outgroups, thereby leading to increased tolerance of said outgroups.

    -   the idea is that interpersonal interactions across lines of difference can help individuals develop an awareness, understanding, and acknowledgment of societal group differences in opinion

    -   may even help individuals differentiate stronger from weaker arguments in the context of such changes

-   Mutz notes that this side of the story emphasizes people's relationships and feelings more than any type of idealized political debate: "It is not important that they learn about the rationales for one another's political views, but it is important that they develop close relationships with those they know to hold quite different political viewpoints" (2006:68).

    -   is it the cognitive or affective path?

        -   we don't know and neither does Anand it seems.

-   Name generators are not the best.

-   the role of threat in tolerance.

### Data/Design

-   CES data. 2018

-   omit independents.

### Independent Variable:

-   **Acquaintance Network**

    -   imagine someone you might chat for a second if you ran into them

    -   how many of them do you think you can guess their party affiliation/who they voted for. They separate the amount of Clinton and Trump.

        -   its a count for Clinton and count for Trump

            -   these numbers represent the amount of in group and out-group people they know.

                -   According to these measures, an estimated 42% of the population knew ten or more inpartisans, while 13% knew ten or more outpartisans. By comparison, 8% knew no fellow inpartisans, and 27% knew no outpartisans.

                    -   this is a cool measure.

-   Supporting IV: Core Network

    -   The battery asked, "Looking back over the last six months - who are the people with whom you discussed matters important to you?

        -   up to 5 individuals

            -   then asked follow up questions.

                -   what if they don't name any - is this because they are lazy or are the politically isolated? this was something Josh brought up to me last semester.

                -   Based on these measures, an estimated 24% of people identified four or five inpartisans in their core network, but only 4% identified four or five outpartisans in their core network. And, 23% of people identified no fellow inpartisans in their core network, while 72% of people identified no outpartisans in their core network.

### Dependent Variable:

-   Extension of Civil Liberties to Outpartisans

    -   "To what extent do you agree with the following statements about \[outparty\]?," where the label for the outparty was "Democrats" for Republican respondents, and "Republicans" for Democratic respondents

    ```         
    -   1\. \[Outparty\] should be allowed to hold a large rally in my community.

    -   2\. \[Outparty\] should be allowed to host a show on my local community access channel

    -   3\. \[Outparty\] should be allowed to make a speech in my community.

        -   Each item included a five-point scale with the following response options: Strongly agree; Agree; Neither agree nor disagree; Disagree; Strongly disagree.
    ```

### Secondary DV:

1\. \[Outparty\] are threatening to the American way of life. 2. \[Outparty\] are a threat to other people's freedom. 3. \[Outparty\] are a threat through their influence on the young. 4. \[Outparty\] are threatening to me personally. 5. I don't have much in common with most people who identify as \[Outparty\]. (reverse scored)

-   combine to form outparty threat.

### Results:

-   People whose core networks (first panel) or acquaintance networks (third panel) have more inparty voters tend to feel more threatened by the outparty.

-   people exposed to more co-partisan acquaintances tend to be more willing to extend liberties to members of the opposing party, despite also feeling greater threat from these outpartisans.

-   Americans' exposure to the inpartisans and outpartisans in their core social networks still operates in expected (and democratically beneficial) ways.

### Lecture Note:

-   Old racism: blatant/overt racism

    -   racial superiority

-   New racism: subtle/proxy

### Abstract:

Old-fashioned racism (OFR) was unrelated to white Americans' partisan preferences throughout the post-civil rights era. This study argues OFR could return to white partisanship following decades of dormancy because of Obama's presidency. After first demonstrating that such attitudes were significantly stronger predictors of opposition to Obama than ideologically similar white Democrats, I support that spillover hypothesis with the following evidence: opposition to interracial dating was correlated with white partisanship in 2009 despite being unrelated to party identification in 12 earlier surveys; moreover, evaluations of Obama completely mediated that relationship between OFR and partisanship; old-fashioned racism predicted changes in white panelists' partisanship between 2006 and 2011; these attitudes were also a stronger determinant of midterm vote preferences in 2010 than they were in 2006, with that relationship once again mediated by President Obama; and experimentally connecting Obama to congressional candidates significantly increased the relationship between OFR and 2010 preferences.

## Ahler, Douglas J. 2014. "Self-Fulfilling Misperceptions of Public Polarization." JOP 76:607-20

### Abstract:

Mass media convey deep divisions among citizens despite scant evidence for such ideological polarization. Do ordinary citizens perceive themselves to be more extreme and divided than they actually are? If so, what are the ramiﬁcations of such misperception? A representative sample from California provides evidence that voters from both sides of the state's political divide perceive both their liberal and conservative peers' positions as more extreme than they actually are, implying inaccurate beliefs about polarization. A second study again demonstrates this ﬁnding with an online sample and presents evidence that misperception of mass-level extremity can affect individuals' own policy opinions. Experimental participants randomly assigned to learn the actual average policy-related predispositions of liberal and conservative Americans later report opinions that are 8--13% more moderate, on average. Thus, citizens appear to consider peers' positions within public debate when forming their own opinions and adopt slightly more extreme positions as a consequence.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   People misperceive polarization and this influences their attitudes/beliefs.

### Research Question:

-   Do ordinary citizens perceive themselves to be more extreme and divided than they actually are?

    -   the difference between perception and actual is interesting. What does that mean?

-   If so, what are the ramifications of such misperceptions

    -   so there is a descriptive endeavor here and then the author asks the implications of the descriptive finding.

### Hypothesis:

1.  Misperceived mass polarization. Citizens tend to overestimate the extremity of their peers' political positions. More specifically, they overestimate the liberalism of self-described liberals and the conservatism of self-described conservatives.

    1.  initial thought: all people or the most idealistic? What type of person is overestimating.

        1.  perhaps if it is the most ideological - it is because they are engaging the most with the information environment of polarized elites?

2.  The consequence of overestimating public polarization. Perceptions of public debate color individuals' own opinions. As a consequence, overestimating the policy-related disagreement between self-described liberals and self-described conservatives lead citizens to report political opinions that are more extreme than they would with perfect information about where their peers stand.

    1.  "I expect that the public would be even more centrist in its opinions if citizens more accurately guaged mass-level opinion."

        1.  I wonder how this relates to engagement via internet and via face-to-face.

            1.  we are back to a mutz/deliberation/information story.

### Background:

-   Citizens are not that polarized

    -   in the ideological polarization conception. See Fiorina v. Iyengar.

-   "One might say that mass media may not be particularly influential in telling people what to think, or perhaps even what to think about, but media are tremendously influiential in telling people what *others* are thinking about and experiencing. These perceptions, in turn, have important consequences for the political behavior of mass publics and political elites as well." - Mutz

-   Why might citizens perceive greater polarization?

    -   elite polarization

        -   especially on the conservative side.

            -   elites polarization might drive people to think the masses are polarized.

                -   information environment increases the likelihood of extreme (liberal or conservative) elites.

    -   **In sum, today's information environment may lead individuals to overestimate mass-level polarization multiple ways: through the use of a polarization narrative, through the role that partisan journalists play as exemplars of liberals and conservatives, and by transmitting information that elite political exemplars are, indeed, becoming more polarized.**

        -   is affective polarization top-down?

-   Why do we care about people's perceptions of polarization?

    -   erroneous beliefs about the public can affect individual attitudes and behaviors by leading individuals to shift toward perceived social norm.

### Study 1: Misperceived Extremism in California

#### Research Design:

-   Test the hypothesis that citizens tend to overestimate self-described liberals' liberalism and self-described conservatives' conservatives' conservatism

-   Pop-representative survey of 2,444 registered voters in California in April and May of 2013.

-   I collected either respondents' own policy-related predispositions for two major policy domains in American politics or their perceptions of self-described liberals' and conservatives' predispositions.

    -   only registered voters.

        -   we can show that the politically active class of citizens in the nation's largest state - a political entity unto itself - believe that the state's population is more polarized than it actually is.

    -   sliding scale (1-7) question for two policy domains.

        -   role of government in managing social welfare

        -   the economy and the trade-off between portecting the environment and protecting jobs.

    -   Other question:

        -   use the same sliding scale to denote where they thought "Californians who call themselves liberal" and "Californias who call themselves conservative" would place themselves.

#### Results:

-   **Do California voters overestimate liberals' liberalism and conservatives' conservatism?**

    -   yes.

        -   both overestimate both groups' extremism.

        -   and they overestimate extremism within their own ranks.

    -   one group is most accurate:

        -   moderates

            -   why?

                -   could be information flows vis-a-vis other citizens?

                    -   Mutz?

                -   Moderate citizens may be less politically engaged and less likely to receive messages about mass polarization from the media and other elites as a result.

                    -   ideological identifiers are more likely than true moderates to turn to the ideological and partisan media outlets that most heavily exagerate polarization.

                    -   this is still a Mutz relationship just a little more complicated.

### Study 2: The Effect of Misperceived Extremism on Political Attitudes

-   What are the consequences of overestimating the degree of polarization within the state's mass public?

    -   Do these erroneous beliefs about peers lead individuals to develop and report attitudes that are more extreme than they otherwise would?

#### Research Design:

-   Do these misperceptions affect individuals' political attitudes?

-   "tell-ask" experiment

    -   the design allows the true positions of liberals and conservatives to be provided to subjects assigned to the "tell" condition.

        -   manipulates beliefs by REMOVING the ignorance.

            -   What is the average treatment effect of being fully informed of the true state of the world?

    -   "ask" condition:

        -   7 point scales

        -   3 screens

            -   each screen contained an ANES question

                -   "average positions taken by people who call themselves liberal and people who call themselves conservative"

    -   They are going to compare the results of the "Tell" to the "Ask" respondents.

        -   Do the "tell" treatment

    -   There is a third condition

        -   distortion

            -   While results from the ''tell'' and ''ask'' conditions can determine whether misperceptions affect attitudes, comparing the ''tell'' and ''distort'' conditions can determine whether misinformation about polarization, decoupled from certainty, affects attitudes

-   **The primary dependent concept of interest is** the degree of extremity of policy opinions reported post-treatment. I asked for opinions on six speciﬁcpolicies, each of which was related to one of the broader policy dimensions used in the treatments.

-   ![](Ahler_results..png)

    -   Recall hypothesis 2: those with the tell condition, moderate their beliefs. This is what we observe above.

        -   moderates are only n=12

            -   not good!

        -   cleaning up misperceptions reduces an individual's own extremism.

        -   This suggests that misperception of public polarization induces attitudes that are more extreme than they otherwise would be.

-   Thus: Is this just a Mutz solution?

    -   more cross-cutting relationships can reduce partisanship as it changes the flow of information which moderates opinions.

-   Interestingly, a similar pattern of across-the-board misperception emerges in Farwell and Weiner's (2000) lab study of stereotypes of liberals and conservatives: members of both groups believe that ingroupmembers as well as outgroup members will behavein a more stereotype-conﬁrming fashion than theyactually do.

-   To a Zaller point, people don't know their beliefs. This just provides a relative metric for respondents to better articulate their belief.

### Lecture/questions:

-   Is sorting and polarization the same thing? dumb question.
-   Motivated thought:
    -   no one is really digging into the variance between education/types of people and ideology. I think the masses (lower stratum) are not any more ideological but they have sorted. They know the brand they associate with at an abstract level. What is going on then is the elites and upper stratum of the masses have grown more idealistic and polarized. The masses are simply just not paying attention to the policies of the parties per say (zaller), but they follow the cues given to them by the increasingly more polarized elites. They are polarized on attitudes but have sorted into the parties and now just follow the party as an abstract identity irrespective of the beliefs (to some degree) the party is supplying.
        -   seems like the authors might disagree? "It maybe be that this polarization is driven by a small segment of the public, while the rest remain more neutral independents. However, the evidence suggests that this is not the case. For example, according to the NES, the number of pure indepenedents among voters in the 2004 presidential eleciton was close to twice as many as in the 1952 election."
            -   wait i have beef with this. This is regarding registered independents.
        -   Also where is the discussion with Converse's groupings of the masses ( the 5 levels or whatever it is)
-   I want more discussion of Zaller in these.
-   there is an information story going on here.
-   Paper respond to Converse.

### Abstract:

*The American electorate today is different from that described in* The American Voter. *Both the 1950s era of ideologically innocent party voting and the subsequent period of partisan dealignment are over. Some political scientists began to describe the New American Voter as a new partisan evolution occurred. What has not been fully appreciated in the twentieth/twenty-first century history of voting studies is how partisanship returned in a form more ideological and more issue based along liberal-conservative lines than it has been in more than 30 years. This is visible in the strength of partisan voting, in the relationship between partisanship and ideology, and in the strength of the relationship of partisanship and self-reported liberal-conservative ideology to the public's economic, social, racial, and religious attitudes and opinions. Not only has the public responded in a striking way to changes in politics and its context, but the current transformation has also appeared to be strikingly enduring and difficult to shake, based on survey evidence for this new partisan voter.*

### Research Question

-   Has the American voter changed in any fundamental way since Campbell and Lazarsfeld's description?

    -   To what extent is the American voter in the early 21st century different from the American voter of past decades?

-   To what extent, then, has the American electorate polarized along party lines and in ideologically definable ways?

-   How do we explain apparent fluctuation in the power of party identification to predict the vote?

### Hypothesis:

### Theory/Argument:

-   **"What has not been fully appreciated in the twentieth/twenty-first century history of voting studies is how partisanship has returned in a form that is both more ideological and more issue based along liberal-conservative lines than it has been in more than 30 years.**"

-   In The American Voter, many voters were ideologically innocent.

    -   "ideologically innocent voters is over."

-   BIG 2 DEBATES IN LITERATURE:

    -   **the "democratic competence" of the American public**

        -   in the classics, people knew very little about facts and limited effect of policy issues.

    -   **and how voters are influenced by longer-term partisan factors and shorter term election-specific factors.**

        -   Michigan v. Colombia.

            -   Lazarsfeld - Colombia - sociological

                -   they focused on the more prevalent socioeconomic bases of partisanship and the importance of interpersonal communication that reinforced the sociological influences on voting or provided new information on the current campaign.

                -   cross-pressure, the role of information, etc.

            -   Campbell - Michigan - social-psychological

                -   emphasized the deeper psychological aspects and influences of partisanship involving the enduring effect of the New Deal realignment (and its socioeconomic bases), affect, generational transmission, and how, in effect, psychological balancing and avoiding dissonance led voters to adhere to partisan predispositions at election time.

                -   the idea of a partisan mass public is a characterization different from Campbell.

    -   "we examine both partisan and related influences on voting."

### Results:

-   We find that this partisanship has voters more strongly anchored than ever before by left/right ideological thinking. This ideology is still steeped in economic issues, but it has become increasingly rooted in social issues and religious values. It also, even more so than earlier, has an important underpinning in racial issues.

-   We agree that states are a poor unit of analysis when studying political polarization and that a great many Americans take positions in the ideological center. However, what all this understates is that there have been real changes among a portion of the electorate consisting of liberals and conservatives as well as Democrats and Republicans who have continued to sort themselves on racial, social, and religious values issues.

-   The partisanship of today's American voters is different: it is more connected to salient policy issues and to liberal-conservative ideological idenitification than it was at least as far back as the 1970s.

### Notes:

-   Chapter 1 sets up the question

-   Chapter 2: asks if partisanship is meaningful and enduring enough to care

-   Chapter 3: More discussion of the stability of party attachments as contrasted with other political attitudes and social identities.

-   very early discussion of party id as a social identity.

-   Michigan school is important but a lot of it is still fuzzy.

    -   is it identity and evaluation.

-   Converse - Achen - Zaller

    -   lots of measurement error discussion.

-   preferences can shift but attachments are enduring.

-   Where the equillibrium in a time series? We want to figure that out.

    -   in time series

        -   if something happens what shifts the equillibrium in opinion?

            -   How fast or does it ever return back to its "equillibrium" state

-   Authors are interested in stability and decay.

### Chapter 1: Introduction:

Main Question: Is partisanship stable? rather, Under what conditions is partisanship stable?

-   "What makes partisanship interesting, and what was not apparent to researchers until the 1950s, is the fact that voters who call themselves Republicans at age thirty-two will most likely continue to do so at age eighty-two."

    -   this persistence in party id is interesting because we don't typically conceive of political party as a core social identity.

-   What are the predictors of who you vote for?

    -   partisanship is obvious but this wasn't always the case! Different identities have been powerful predictors

        -   race especially!

-   candidate centered elections.

    -   institutions have grown suspect.

-   Political Science Broadly:

    -   thinks about partisan identities as to how they are shaped by rational evaluations of party platforms and performance in office.

        -   Downs.

    -   Fiorina argues partisanship constitutes a "running tally" of performance evaluations

        -   ehhhh

#### Argument:

-   Social-psychological perspective of partisanship

    -   Partisan attachments form relatively early in adulthood

        -   there is a critical understudy of youth's politicization and their ENGAGEMENT in political discourse.

    -   When people feel a sense of belonging to a given social group, they absorb the doctrinal positions that the group advocates.

-   Our thesis:

    -   partisan identities reflect a blend of cognition and affect.

        -   People know who they are and where they fit in the matrix of prominent social groups.

            -   Citizens' group attachments shape the way that they evaluate political candidates and the policies they espouse.

                -   These evaluations change as new information becomes available, but seldom does the political environment change in ways that alter how people think of themselves or their relationship to significant social groups.

                    -   For this reason, voters' attachments may remain firm even as their voting preferences shift.

                        -   Thus, the basic structure of electoral competition remains intact even as the personae and policies that dominate politics change.

#### Identification versus Evaluation:

-   Party identification is similar to religion.

    -   an identifiable social group.

    -   this is kinda scary given how religion is pretty enduring.

-   Why do changing political and economic circumstances not have a bigger effect on party attachments?

    -   Campbell argues partisans ignore or deflect information that is inconsistent with their party attachments

        -   good support for this in the lit.

    -   Public is also inattentive to politics - Campbell.

-   **We disagree about how partisans attend to and retain information about party performance. Like those scholars who emphasize the rational underpinnings of public opinion, we are skeptical of the notion that partisans ignore or reinterpret discrodant information.**

    -   We find that although citizens often lack specific information about day-to-day political events, they do update their overall assessments of national conditions and the capacities of the parties to handle important problems.

-   **People may assimilate new information about the parties and change their perceptions of the parties without changing the team for which they cheer.**

-   How do people define themselves in relation to political groups?

-   To what extent are perceptions of these groups susceptible to change?

#### Partisan Images:

-   Book focuses on identification with social groups.

    -   the parties have stereotypes

        -   What kinds of social groups come to mind as I think about Democrats, Republicans, Independents?

            -   Which assemblage of groups (if any) best describes me?

-   Youth have more frequent social changes.

-   Social identity theory - an individuals drive to achieve positive self-esteem

    -   people attach themselves to socially valued groups, and those who are trapped in low-status groups either disassociate themselves or formulate a different way of looking a groups, such that this group is more prized than others.

        -   **AUTHORS DISAGREE.**

            -   We focus on how people categorize themselves and remain agnostic about the uderlying psychological motives that impel people to form social identities such as party attachment.

                -   **AT MOST, VOTERS CAN BE SAID TO BE MAXIMIZING THE FIT BETWEEN THEIR SOCIAL MORES AND THEIR SELF-CONCEPTIONS.**

#### Party Change:

-   Party id is enduring but that doesn't mean it doesn't change.

    -   even with big events it is still slow to change.

#### Plan of this book:

-   Partisan affiliation is best understood as a form of social identity and the partisan stability is traceable to constancy in citizens' primary group environment and their mental images of partisan groups.

-   "Finally at the individual level, we have evidence that party attachments change as people migrate from one political environment to another...The fact that residential mobility affects partisanship further attests to the social dimension of party attachment.

### Chapter 2: Partisan Groups as Objects of Identification

-   Identification = 2 meanings

    -   affinity

        -   a similarity or characteristics suggesting a relationship.

    -   self-categorization.

-   These often overlap

-   PID is not an ephemeral opinion that is activated when closer to elections! \`

-   Social identities are porous

    -   party identification is one of these

        -   their isn't a super high threshold to identify with these parties.

-   Parties have brands

-   Partisanship was conceptualzied as a psychological identification with party....As thus conceived, partisans are partisan because they think they are partisan.

-   The thrust so far is that parties are not just vehicles for policy preferences but are rather chiefly social identities.

    -   the correlation between party id and stances on issues is often weak.

#### What do Partisan Self-Categorizations Mean?

Why should we beleive that citizens harbor genuine, long-lasting attachments to partisan groups?

1.  Partisan attachments are professed repeatedly during the course of a survey interview, even when these attachments are at variance with vote choice.

2.  People who use partisan labels to describe themselves also indicate their "identification with" and "identification as" members of these partisan groups.

3.  People offer the same descriptions of their partisan attachments over long stretches of time, even when the political context has changed.

4.  The distribution of partisan identification changes slowly over time.

5.  The proportion of the public identifying with any party tends to be relatively unaffected by whether the survey takes place during an election campaign.

6.  Despite the marked differences between state and national voting pattersn, the distribution of American partisanship does not change appreciably when attention is focused on state rather than national political parties.

7.  Partisans find politics more engaging than Independents.

### Chapter 3: A Closer Look at Partisan Stability

-   Our **central hypothesis is: that partisan self-conceptions much more closely resemble ethnic or religious self-conceptions than they do evaluations of political leaders, opinions about party platforms, or vote intention.**

    -   big disagreement with Downs!

    -   self-conceptions persist but political evaluations often change dramatically from the environment/events.

-   Methodological issues in measuring this.

-   2 concepetions of stability

    -   one that focuses on the location of individuals relative to other people in the population

    -   and another that examines how an individual's location at any point in time compares with that person's long term average.

-   Party attachment vs. growing radicalism in attitudes

-   measure attachment and then strength

-   party attachment changes occur slowly

    -   small changes do add up over time

    -   "Our view is not that partisan identities are immutable but rather that they change gradually and often for various reasons that are not directly connected to political events...partisan change often seems to spring from changes in a person's immediate environment - where they live and with whom they interact with"

        -   bishop and Mutz!

-   Although teenagers are strongly influenced by their parents' party affinities, this imprint fades over time as young adults are exposed to other influences and develop their own views.

## Niemi et al. "Is the American Electorate Polarized." In Controversies in Voting Behavior, 5th ed. Niemi et al., eds. CQ Press.(tbd)

### 12. Is the American Electorate Polarized?

-   No one debates elite polarization.

-   Debate is around mass polarization

    -   keep in mind that a lot of lit mixes up these definitions below.

    -   how closely does attitudinal differences correspond to party preferences.

#### What is polarization?

-   Multiple ways to define:

    -   Polarization exist when people take opposing positions on a specific issue, or on issues more generally.

        -   if we are dealing with a liberal-conservative scale, polarization increases as people move to the ideological extremes - opinion radicalization or more preferred: *attitudinal polarization*

    -   Alt def: refers to the degree of that the public is sorted into opposing ideological (or issue) camps in a way that conincides with their party leanings.

-   Partisan sorting refers to when those on two sides move to opposing parties, increasing intra-party homogeneity as well as making the parties sharply different from one another.

#### A Polarized Electorate

-   Abromwitz and Saunders argue some portions of the electorate are more polarized than others.

    -   the least engaged portion is largely centrist.

    -   increased polarization has energized the electorate.

-   Overall, there is evidence of multiple, large fractures in the American electorate, fissures that have grown in the recent past and become more tied to partisanship

#### The Dynamics of Polarization

-   Debate over how partisan polarization developed at the mass level.

    -   top-down

        -   elites set the term of debate

            -   author focuses on partisan voting in Congress

                -   what about non--political elite cues. More elites = more variance

                    -   thats what i think

                        -   Layman, Carsey, and Horowitz (2006) seem to have a similar take.

                            -   argue more party activists.

    -   others argue is inherently interactive

        -   this is likely true

            -   kinda a Fenno argument here.

            -   also see Riker (1982) - politicians will raise new issues as a tactic to try to break apart existing coalitions

    -   economic polarization

-   Fiorina strongly argues against the masses growing more political polarized.

    -   contends the electorate is moderate.

    -   changes at the mass level are instances of sorting, rather than polarization.

    -   social characteristics are no longer as big of a predictor in voting.

    -   Gelman agrees with Fiorina.

-   Fiorina vs. Abromwitz and Saunders

-   ideological polarization is greater among high-knowledge voters. - Abramowitz

-   Fiorina argue voters choices have become more polarized over the years (they are faced with a choice between a liberal Democrat and a conservative Republican), but they emphasize that voters themselves have not polarized.

-   Abramowitz looks at specific policy. Fiorina looks at big abstract concepts.

-   **still debate about the electorate's level of partisanship.**

    -   **there is clearly more partisan voting**

## Iyengar, Shanto, Gaurav Sood, and Yphtach Lelkes. 2012. "Affect, Not Ideology: A Social Identity Perspective on Polarization." POQ . 76:405-31.

### Thoughts:

-   on second reading, this kinda comes back to Lazarsfeld for me.

-   in group and out-group dynamics.

### Abstract:

the current debate over the extent of polarization in the American mass public focuses on the extent to which partisans' policy preferences have moved. Whereas "maximalists" claim that partisans' views on policies have become more extreme over time (Abramowitz 2010), "minimalists" (Fiorina and Abrams 2009) contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occurred reflects sorting, i.e., the increased association between partisanship and ideology. We argue in favor of an alternative definition of polarization, based on the classic concept of social distance (Bogardus 1947). using data from a variety of sources, we demonstrate that both republicans and democrats increasingly dislike, even loathe, their opponents. We also find that partisan affect is inconsistently (and perhaps artifactually) founded in policy attitudes. the more plausible account lies in the nature of political campaigns; exposure to messages attacking the out-group reinforces partisans' biased views of their opponents

### Bumper Sticker:

-   in terms of affect, Americans are polarized along party lines.

### Research Question:

-   Is the masses affectively polarized?

### Hypothesis:

-   The mere act of identifiying with a political party is sufficient to trigger engative evaluations of the opposition, and exposure to prolonged media-based campaigns only reinforces these predispositions.

-   Over time partisans' ratings of the opposing party will turn increasingly negative.

-   Given the increasing divide between party elites and followers in their policy preferences, we might also anticipate some downturn in ratings of the in-party.

### Background/Theory:

-   Debate around polarization:

    -   Fiorina - minimalist - contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occured reflects sorting - increases association between partisanship and ideology.

    -   Abramowitz - maximialist - claim that partisans' views on policies have become more extreme over time.

-   Iyengar argues for a new conception

    -   **affective polarization**

        -   the extent to which partisans view each other as a dislike out-group

-   They ground their theory in social identity theory (Tajfel)

    -   group membership triggers positive feelings for in-group and negative evaluations of the out-group.

    -   but people have multiple group memberships, which affiliations provide the most meaningful cues?

        -   salience is important for that question.

-   Authors argue the campaign raises the salience of political membership

    -   this I buy (obviously) but also there needs to be some discussion of the collapse of other group membership salience. Party membership has become such a defining identity and trumps many others at all times.

        -   They kinda address this point, "Thus, greater exposure to the harsh rhetoric of political campaigns is one potential explanation of affective polarization."

### Method/Design:

-   national and cross-national survey

-   United States and UK.

-   feeling thermometer

-   1960 -2010

-   inter-party social distance

    -   stereotypes of party supporters and feelings about marriage across party lines.

-   Compare party affiliation with other prominent social cleavages in the United States, including gender, race, and religion, as bases for affective polarization.

-   Then is affective polarization a consequence of ideological polarization

    -   OR is it a result of information changes (greater exposire to harsh rhetoric) specifiically through the campaign?

### Data:

-   Six different survey data sets:

    -   ANES

        -   time series

    -   2008 YouGov (US and UK)

    -   Almond and Verba 1960 five-nation study (from The Civic Culture)

    -   2004 Blair Center Election Study

    -   US component of an eleven-nation study conducted by YouGov in 2010

    -   AP-Yahoo! News 2008 election study.

-   Wisconsin Advertising Project:

    -   ads broadcast in the top 100 media markets during the 2004 elections.

### Results:

-   We show that Democrats and Republicans not only increasingly dislike the opposing party, but also impute negative traits to the rank-and-file of the out-party.

-   Democrats and Republicans generally rate their own party highly - and this has been stable.

-   Outparty ratings however have dropped by some fifteen points since 1988.

-   "activist" members are more affectively polarized.

    -   there are more activists.

        -   non-activist members have also grown more affectively polarized but not as much compared to the activist.

            -   these are both related to measures on Democrats and Republicans

-   Affective polarization toward liberals/conservatives is significantly less

    -   democrats evaluations of conservatives remain in the 40-50 range over the entire period

    -   HOWEVER, Republicans' ratings of liberals are some 5-8 points lower.

        -   I feel like this is where Lilliana Mason's work comes in.

-   Affect doesn't really move in response to election outcomes.

-   Conservatives would be more displeased if their child married an out-party.

-   marriage out-party was more important in the UK back in the 1960s

    -   this has increased considerably in America.

        -   more social distance in America than UK.

-   Trait Ratings:

    -   more stereotyping of out party.

    -   it was the Americans who expressed more positive views of party supporters and negative views of their opponents.

    -   positive traits for in-party supporters

### What explains the development of affective polarization?

-   **2 possible explanations:**

    -   **movement in policy attitudes among the masses and the elites**

        -   is affective polarization simply a symptom of divergent movement in policy attitudes among both partisan supporters and party elites? Basically is their spillover of ideological -\> affective

            -   not strong evidence

                -   For parties to be seen in ideological terms would require an awareness of their policy stances, yet most Americans have difficulty correctly locating parties on issue scales

    -   ***exposure to increasingly negative political campaigns***

        -   this is an operationalization of political top-down information flow.

            -   test this by leveraging those who live in battleground states

                -   they are exposed to greater negative campaigns.

                    -   effect of exposure to negative ads is modest.

                        -   this is to be expected because negative ads represents a small share of the info stream.

                        -   partisans in battleground states were especially likely to become polarized

                        -   **overall, our analyses suggest that greater levels of negativity in advertising campaigns and general exposure to political campaigns both contribute to higher levels of affective polarization.**

### Lecture Notes:

-   Longitudinal data

-   natural experiment

    -   uses voting age change

        -   an experiment needs randomization and manipulation.

-   this is a regression discontinuity!

### Purpose:

-   this study considers how votes cast help us understand the perennial finding of age-related gains in strength of partisanship across the life cycle and addresses the selection problem through the use of vote eligibility as an instrument of actual vote.

-   this research calls to relax a rigid assumption made in the literature on voting behavior, namely the attitudes lead to behavior but not vice versa

### Abstract:

Party identification is known to influence almost all aspects of political life. How this attachment develops across the adult life cycle, however, remains unknown. I argue that people reinforce their partisan predispositions by voting for their preferred party. Voting entails a choice over a set of alternatives. This choice is likely to induce rationalization. In so doing, it provides signals of group identity, which in turn strengthens people's partisan ties. Testing this hypothesis is made difficult because it implies a reciprocal relationship between partisanship and vote choice. I address this problem by using vote eligibility as an instrument of vote in a sample of almost equally aged respondents. The results indicate that elections fortify prior partisan orientations. Moreover, they do so not by increasing political information. Rather, it is the act of voting for a party that, itself, bolsters partisan attachment. This act leaves a long-lasting imprint on people's partisan outlooks.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   voting strengthens PID which helps explain why older people are rigid in beliefs.

    -   may also explain why voter turnout is higher at older ages.

-   Elections are partisan affirming events.

### Research Question:

-   How do enduring partisan ties come into being?

-   People do change partisanship throughout life, even as adults. Why?

    -   political socialization at early age is not enough to explain this.

-   Partisanship increases as people get older, why?

### Hypothesis:

-   I argue that elections matter but in a different way. Participating in the electoral process means converting a preference into a behavioral choice. The resulting sense of commitment intensifies the link between the individual and the party.

    -   this mechanism seems like people post hoc justify and dig in as their vote as a commitment.

### Background/Theory:

-   Repeated exposure to the same political context, Converse argued, fosters enduring partisan sentiments, which are then transmitted to coming generations through political socialization.

-   length of one's experience with the political system is important

    -   how this experience translates into increased partisan support, however, has been left an open question.

-   Whatever is causing partisanship to strengthen with age is boosting partisan ties irrespective of shifts in how the parties are differentiated on policy and in the extent of their electoral success.

-   Party identification is strengthened when individuals convert a partisan identity or leaning into a behavioral choice through the act of voting, and it is weakened when the two are at odds.

-   partisanship increases overtime

-   elections may be important because they give the opportunity to individuals to confirm or reaffirm their identity by casting a vote for their preferred party.

-   **It is this idea that is of particular interest here. Once people make a choice over a set of alternatives, they become more favorable toward their initially preferred alternative. This logic can be directly applied in the case of elections. Having opted for one of the parties leads voters to think of the party more positively than they had before the election.**

-   I employ all four waves of the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study, 1965--1973--1982--1997

### Thoughts:

-   This is kinda the same paper/mechanism as Ahler but only they add a variable to include networks (aka Mutz)

-   this is core networks

    -   what about non-core networks?

### Abstract:

Drawing on the sizable literature on polarization in the American public, we consider the link between discussion network composition and *perceptions* of polarization. Participants in the 2008--2009 ANES panel study were asked to complete an innovative battery; they interactively moved histograms to rate other groups' positions on several prominent issues. These novel exercises provide data on individuals' projections of the average attitudes of others, but critically, they also provide data on the variability of such attitudes. Thus, we use these "response-distributions" to thoroughly assess (1) the relationship between network characteristics and perceptions of the distance between party opinions, and (2) the relationship between network characteristics and perceptions of the homogeneity of opinions within parties. We find evidence that discussion networks track with individual perceptions of the parties in the electorate: exposure to interpersonal disagreement predicts the perception of less distance between (the mean opinions of) the parties, and the reporting of more heterogeneity of opinion within the parties. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for democratic functioning more generally.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   Ahler but with Mutz and network stuff.

### Research Question:

-   Does political information exposure in core networks influence perceptions of the electorate?

-   How do people perceive distributions of issue attitudes?

-   If Democrats and Republicans think they are further apart than they really are, what factors are responsible?

-   Finally, if "social distances" between the parties are growing \[and are independent of actual issue stances (Iyengar et al. [2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-017-9387-7#ref-CR24 "Iyengar, S., Sood, G., & Lelkes, Y. (2012). Fear and loathing in party politics: A social identity perspective on polarization. Public Opinion Quarterly, 76, 405–431."))\], do such gaps condition views of group opinions?

-   The central question is not what drives people to believe that others share their views, but what drives their perceptions of extremity and homogeneity in others.

### Hypothesis:

-   *The tolerance perspective predicts that when exposed to disagreement, citizens will perceive less distance between the parties and/or more heterogeneity within them.*

-   *The social categorization perspective argues that disagreement may encourage individuals to see more homogeneity within partisan groups and/or greater distance between said groups.*

### Background/Theory:

-   Many scholars cede that regardless of whether opinions of Democrats and Republicans are actually drifting apart, Americans tend to *think* they are drifting apart

-   **Perceptions of polarization are important in their own right. If citizens view members of the out-party as more ideologically extreme or homogenous than they are, a host of democratic negatives may follow: people may be less likely to engage in disagreeable discussion in order to avoid conflict (that may not actually exist), and may falsely dismiss contrary perspectives as radical/extreme---in other words, the beneficial effects of discourse across lines of difference may be precluded (see, e.g., Mutz [2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-017-9387-7#ref-CR35 "Mutz, D. C. (2006). Hearing the other side: Deliberative versus participatory democracy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.")).**

-   Taken together, the fact that elites are polarized, but that the views of the average citizen are potentially more nuanced (and differ based on affect vs. issue positions) raises questions: How do people perceive distributions of issue attitudes?

-   We focus on how social networks structure such evaluations to move beyond standard assessments of how individual attitudes drive perceptions (i.e., simple projection---Judd et al. [2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-017-9387-7#ref-CR26 "Judd, C. M., Van Boven, D., Huber, M., & Nunes, A. (2012). Measuring everyday perceptions of the distribution of the American electorate. In J. Aldrich & K. McGraw (Eds.), Improving public opinion surveys: Interdisciplinary innovation and the american national election studies (pp. 195–219). Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.")), or of how affect towards groups and candidates has changed; perceptions of the composition and distribution of beliefs in the electorate warrant additional attention.

-   **exposure to socially supplied distributions of opinions will color individuals' perceptions of opinion distributions in broader groups of Democrats and Republicans**

### Independent Variable

-   Network Characteristics

    -   The discussion network battery contains a political name generator in which respondents are asked to identify three discussants with whom they discuss politics, and are then asked to report on their characteristics

### Dependent Variable:

-   Mean Distance and Standard Deviations:

    -   how homogenous or heterogeneous they think that their and the opposing party's views are on an issue, *and* how far apart they believe the two parties are

### Results:

-   We find evidence that discussion networks track with individual perceptions of the parties in the electorate: exposure to interpersonal disagreement predicts the perception of less distance between (the mean opinions of) the parties, and the reporting of more heterogeneity of opinion within the parties.

-   **Exposure to disagreement serves to reduce differences between the two parties in the electorate; discussing politics with those who hold different beliefs affects perceptions of polarization by encouraging individuals to see less distance between the average opinions in the parties, but also more heterogeneity of opinion within them.**

-   **Finally, some have argued that a different kind of selection is now at work---that Americans are exposed to dissonant perspectives less and less frequently in day to day life as our society becomes more spatially polarized (e.g., Bishop [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-017-9387-7#ref-CR400 "Bishop, B. (2008). The big sort: Why the clustering of like-minded America is tearing us apart. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.")); this has been pinned to increasing ideological polarization (as people are not afforded the opportunity to understand out-party views). We are not able to weigh in on the sorting debate, and we do not examine the extent to which exposure to disagreement influences actual opinion polarization (we limit our focus to perceptions). However, as our results suggest that exposure to political difference may reduce perceptions of polarization, we would again emphasize a cautiously optimistic tone. Even if people are moving to more politically homogeneous areas, since individuals are often unable to avoid all interpersonal disagreement, there may be reason to suspect that networks could help remedy some of the more deleterious consequences of geographic polarization. We encourage scholars to conduct additional research on the social roots of polarization perceptions so that more definitive conclusions can be reached, and more certain assessments given to this aspect of democratic health.**

## [Beck, Dalton, Greene, and Huckfeldt. 2002. "The Social Calculus of Voting: Interpersonal, Media, and Organizational Influences on Presidential Choices." American Political Science Review, 96:57-73.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/social-calculus-of-voting-interpersonal-media-and-organizational-influences-on-presidential-choices/4605211FD617AAB1F9686F774CFBC5CB)

### Lecture Notes:

-   Framing - how info is presented

### Abstract:

Voting choices are a product of both personal attitudes and social contexts, of a personal and a social calculus. Research has illuminated the personal calculus of voting, but the social calculus has received little attention since the 1940s. This study expands our understanding of the social influences on individual choice by examining the relationship of partisan biases in media, organizational, and interpersonal intermediaries to the voting choices of Americans. Its results show that the traditional sources of social influence still dominate: Interpersonal discussion outweighs the media in affecting the vote. Media effects appear to be the product of newspaper editorial pages rather than television or newspaper reporting, which contain so little perceptible bias that they often are misperceived as hostile. Parties and secondary organizations also are influential, but only for less interested voters---who are more affected by social contexts in general. Overall, this study demonstrates that democratic citizens are embedded in social contexts that join with personal traits in shaping their voting decisions.

### Bumper Sticker:

The primary sources of these cues are personal networks and groups, not the modern mass media, which has often been ceded greater electoral significance. Second, these partisan cues have a direct influence on voting behavior. To be sure, personal characteristics are key factors in voting: partisanship, ideologies, and fixed personal characteristics play powerful roles in determining the vote. Our evidence indicates, however, that these personal forces are only part of the voting calculus.

### Research Questions:

1.  How are political choices shaped by a decision maker's immediate social and informational context?

2.  What candidates did the intermediaries to which voters were exposed in the 1992 presidential election campaign favor?

3.  What was the relationship between the biases of their intermediaries and voters' choices in 1992?

4.  **Our ultimate question is whether partisan biases in voters' information sources influence their vote choices**

### Hypothesis/Argument:

-   By relying on one information source rather than another, citizens are more or less likely to encounter information that encourages some choices and outcomes while it discourages others.

-   If the flow of information coming to voters is skewed in favor of one candidate over another, we hypothesize that this will influence their electoral decisions, even after their own partisan orientations and other enduring personal influences on the vote are taken into account.

### Background:

-   There is a cognitive capacity that varies and can be overwhelmed.

-   Shift away from voting as a product of "personal" to "social" calculus.

-   There are a lot of different ways to get information now than in 1940 (Lazarsfeld time).

-   TV has changed everything.

-   Message sent $\neq$ message received.

    -   hard to test how people take cues from who if there are so many different ways.

-   people can also selectively perceive the messages that are sent.

-   Should bias be measured at the source or at the receiver?

    -   authors argue better to look at receiver.

        -   but is still not perfect.

            -   Authors re-argue we should just know both

-   Interpersonal discussion networks are important influences on political behavior - Huckfeldt.

-   Granovetter pops up again.

    -   importance of weak ties!

        -   because of this, we need to look beyond the most intimate discussants.

-   They are arguing media is unbiased....lol

-   Partisans in our data were more likely to perceive their newspaper and television news as biased in favor of the candidate of the other party

-   exposure is a necessary ingredient for influence.

-   "Personal discussants enjoy the advantage of having close and continuing relationships with the voter. No other intermediary can match the level of attention that discussants' political messages receive."

    -   idk if this is still the case anymore.

-   [Zaller's (1992)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/social-calculus-of-voting-interpersonal-media-and-organizational-influences-on-presidential-choices/4605211FD617AAB1F9686F774CFBC5CB#ref058) theory predicts that the influence of messages received from intermediaries will grow as political awareness declines, at least as long as the person is exposed to political messages. While inattentiveness makes reception of political messages less likely, once they are received people with little political information find them difficult to resist.

```         
-   This leaves less informed voters more open to influence by short-term considerations and other forces---including, perhaps, their immediate social context.
```

-   **Based on these results, one can conclude that the social context is more important for less politicized than for more politicized members of the American electorate.**

-   Rather, voters' enduring personal characteristics interact with the messages they are receiving from the established social context in which they operate.

### Data:

-   1992 presidential election in the US.

-   Five nation Cross-National Election Project (CNEP)

-   telephone survey of the american electorate

    -   n=1318

        -   cluster this sample in 39 counties.

-   then did a snowball sample of discussants mentioned by the respondents in our main survey.

    -   study personal discussion networks. l

-   Also coded news reports and editorials in the major daily newspaper read by county residents for a sample of days during the election campaign.

-   Fourth, we conducted content analysis of the national network news programs during the same period.

-   Fifth, in each county they surveyed county party and presidential organizations on their activities during the campaign.

-   respondents were asked to report which candidate each of up to five discussants supported in the 1992 election

    -   the first four were to be discussants "with whom they discussed important matters"

        -   the fifth named discussants was prompted to be an explicitly political discussant who was not already mentioned

            -   60% of sample added a fifth.

                -   only a slight majority of them were relatives.

-   **Finally, about 30% of Americans in 1992 were not located in a discussion context noticeably favorable to a single candidate. This is a substantial share of the electorate to lack partisan anchoring through personal networks---more than found in the early Columbia studies**

-   Fig1 contains survey respondents perceptions of which candidate was favored by the principal newspaper they read and by the television network newscast they watched the most.

-   Our survey asked respondents about their membership in up to three organizations, including whether each supported a candidate in the election. The number of specific organizations named was very large, precluding direct measurement of each organization's partisan preferences, so we rely entirely upon perceptions of organizational bias.

### Results:

-   about 30% of Americans in 1992 were not located in a discussion context noticeably favorable to a single candidate. This is a substantial share of the electorate to lack partisan anchoring through personal networks---more than found in the early Columbia studies

-   Partisans in our data were more likely to perceive their newspaper and television news as biased in favor of the candidate of the other party

-   Compared to discussion networks, then, the media were considerably less likely to be sources of partisan-biased information during the 1992 presidential election campaign. They were less partisan overall, and their partisanship was inconsistent across their stories.

-   The data on organizations tell a story of little organizational bias overall, but it generally favors the Democrats where it does appear. America is a nation of joiners, and 85% of the sample reported membership in at least one organization. The organizations Americans join are overwhelmingly nonpolitical, however; fewer than one-quarter of the respondents claimed that an organization to which they belonged supported one of the presidential candidates.

-   Personal discussants:

    -   In each case, the candidate favored by the discussion network is advantaged. Of the two measures, perceived discussant preferences consistently turn out to be more important than actual discussant preferences, but each adds significantly to the account.

-   Republicans single out television as more "hostile" medium than newspapers.

-   Party activity had a limited relationship to voting in 1992.

-   County partisan context is null

    -   county is too big of a geographical unit.

-   **The partisan cues of personal discussants, newspaper editorials, and secondary organizations seem most influential in presidential vote choices in 1992.**

## Berry, C. and W. Howell. 2007. "Accountability and Local Elections: Rethinking Retrospective Voting." Journal of Politics. 69(3): 844-858.

### Abstract:

For too long, research on retrospective voting has fixated on how economic trends affect incumbents' electoral prospects in national and state elections. Hundreds of thousands of elections in the United States occur at the local level and have little to do with unemployment or inflation rates. This paper focuses on the most prevalent: school boards. Specifically, it examines whether voters hold school board members accountable for the performance of their schools. The 2000 elections reveal considerable evidence that voters evaluate school board members on the basis of student learning trends. During the 2002 and 2004 school board elections, however, when media (and by extension public) attention to testing and accountability systems drifted, measures of achievement did not influence incumbents' electoral fortunes. These findings, we suggest, raise important questions about both the scope conditions of retrospective voting models and the information voters rely upon when evaluating incumbents.

### Bumper Sticker

### Research Questions:

1.  Do voters reward elected officials for a job well done?

2.  Do voters' ballot selections primarily reflect other considerations that have little to do with an incumbent's performance in office?

3.  Do average voters hold school board members accountable for the performance of their schools?

4.  Do voters punish or reward incumbent school board members on the basis of changes in student learning in local and district schools?

5.  What exactly do they hold them accountable for?

### Hypothesis:

-   The prevalence of retrospective voting in local elections, we suggest, critically depends upon the volume, tone, and sources of information that voters have about recent changes in the relevant domains of public life.

### Background:

-   **Retrospective voting: the proposition that citizens examine whether the state of the world has improved under a politician's watch, and vote accordingly.**

-   Local gov officials usually overlooked.

-   Literature on retrospective voting supposes that a voter's decision to support or oppose an incumbet's reelection efforts ultimately rides upon recent changes in inflation and unemployment rates.

#### Whether to Hold Incumbents Accountable?

-   Key really kicks off this literature.

-   retrospective seems to be somewhat common.

-   National/state elections have good evidence for retrospective but are sparse on local.

    -   Kaufman (2004) finds that racial politics usually trump retrospective evaluations of incumbent performance in mayoral elections in major U.S. cities

        -   this is interesting.

            -   wonder how DEI at school board is the racial element weaponized.

#### What to Hold Incumbents Accountable for?

-   school-board members have some direct influence on school performance.

-   I am wondering about the size of the school-board. Thinking about Oliver and polycentrism here.

#### Retrospective Voting in School Board Elections

-   two institutional features of local elections enhance the general possibility that voters will hold school board members responsible for the performance of local schools

    -   members' job responsibilities are reasonably well defined, which simplifies the task of evaluating their performances in office.

    -   Second, because most board elections are nonpartisan, party identification does not rival retrospective evaluations of incumbents as a basis for voting behavior.

-   Retrospective depends on the amount and type of info that voters have about the incumbents' performances in office.

-   In the context of school board elections, there are often measures of trends in the school.

-   coverage of school boards is uneven and episodic.

### Data:

-   31414 school and district-level achievement trends and precint- and district-lvel voting returns in 499 races over three electoral cycles in South Carolina.

-   85 districts.

    -   half hold school board elections in any two-year election cylce.

    -   precint-level election returns for all school board races and the computed the vote share for each incumbent running in a competitive election.

-   student achievement data

### Results:

-   With average incumbent vote share at 58%, these estimates suggest that a major swing in test scores can erode as much as two-fifths of an incumbets margin of victory.

-   district-level scores were not significant, suggesting that voters focused on school performance within their immediate neighborhood rather than across the broader district.

-   In models that include both districtand precinct-level scores (not shown), we again find that only precinct-level scores have a significant relationship with vote share.

-   test score changes continue to attain statistical significance and remain in the expected direction: incumbents appear disinclined to seek reelection when their district's test scores drop.

-   The point estimates from column 2 suggest that a movement from the 75th to the 25th percentile in test score change is associated with an 18 percentage point increase in the probability of facing a challenger

-   **The evidence from South Carolina suggests that voters, at least some of the time, do acquire the information required to vote retrospectively in school board elections. Unfortunately, though, we do not observe the actual source of that information.**

-   Suppose, first, that voters rely upon mediated sources of information. To explain the findings we observe,it must be the case that the amount and/or type of media coverage granted to student test scores differed markedly across the three electoral cycles. In fact, we find considerable evidence that it did.

## Hillygus, D.S. 2010. "Campaign Effects on Vote Choice." In The Oxford Handbook of American Elections and Political Behavior. J. Leighley, ed. Oxford UP.\*

### Abstract:

This article describes how far the literature of campaign effects on vote choice has come, and where it should go. It seems clear that the effects of campaigns are more constrained than often is presented in the media. Moreover, the state of research regarding theinfluence of campaigns on vote choice (rather than turnout), including campaign effects due to citizen learning, campaign priming, and, more directly, voter persuasion, is discussed. The recent evidence of campaign effects largely reflects the availability of better data and more sophisticated research designs. In addition to individual-levelvariation in the way voters process campaign information, there is also variation in theparticular campaign messages they receive. The great variation in candidate strategy and voter decision making should be viewed as both an opportunity and challenge for campaign scholars.

### Argument/Point of Article:

-   Literature Review

-   **"Scholars should move beyond trying to estimate the effect of campaigns, and instead should study for whom, when, and in what ways campaigns matter."**

-   What is the influence of campaigns on vote choice, citizen learning, campaign priming, and, more directly, voter persuasion?

### Literature Review (intro):

-   debate about campaign effect.

    -   no longer a consensus of minimal campaign effects.

-   In a context in which Hitler had risen to power amidst an unprecedented propaganda campaign and an Orson Welles radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds had created mass panic, Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues were concerned that campaigns could manipulate the public.

    -   Cambell argues its more of long-term characterisitcs about an individual

-   Columbia school did offer evidence that campaigns can change the relative weight of some considerations.

    -   priming effect.

        -   campaigns make things salient.

            -   campaigns are important primarily because they activate latent predispositions.

-   campaigns offer a mobilization effect - Nie, Verba, Petrocik

#### The "Minimal Effects" Perspective

-   Political scientists were able to develop the "fundamentals" (economic conditions and presidential approval) that would do a pretty good job at predicting who would win.

-   Campaigns are minimal because they nullify each other.

    -   candidates have similar skill and money.

-   Campaigns provide voters with information to help activate their predispostion (Gelman and King)

#### Learning

-   campaigns increase voters' knowledge of candidates and issues.

-   interpersonal discussions (Beck et al. 2002)

    -   read earlier.

-   What source of information produces the greatest learning effects?

    -   no real way to test/know this.

    -   the expansion of media choice has exacerbated the knowledge gap in the electorate. The information age enables political junkies to follow the politicalworld more closely than ever before, but it also allows others to avoid it altogether

#### Priming:

-   priming - changing the weight voters attach to different considerations.

-   strong support for campaign's effect in priming.

-   Campaigns may help remind people of their party affiliation

    -   others find ideology or issues more likely to be activated than partisanship.

-   priming brings issues to the top of the head - more easily accessible cognitively

    -   Zaller argument.

#### Persuasion:

-   The question of whether campaigns persuade is normative the most important and interesting!

    -   hard to measure!

-   **Persuasion: any campaign-induced changes in the attitudes or considerations that underlie the vote decision.**

-   the wayward partisan who returns home in response to the party conventions might be considered evidence of campaign persuasion.

-   Campaigns do not typically get individuals to vote against their predispositions, but they do help voters sort through diverse and conflicting predispositions, shaping which onesvoters bring to bear in selecting a preferred candidate

    -   This means, then, that learning and priming could be the mechanisms by which individualsmight change their vote choice

-   Debate about the effect of persuasion

    -   convention and debates can have a persuasion effect

    -   television ad can too

-   still don't really know.

### Measurement and Analysis of Campaign Effects

-   New understandings of campaigns with new data.

-   Innovations in field experiments andsurvey experiments have allowed for cleaner assessments of voter exposure to andreaction to campaign activities.

### Toward a New Study of Campaign Effects

-   We need to step back to consider the reciprocal flow of influence between candidates and voters in a political campaign.

    -   And we should start with clearer expectations about the decision‐making process of both candidates and voters in a political campaign.

-   Rather, for any campaign effect---especially persuasion---we should expect that it may be larger or smaller depending on characteristics of thecampaign information and characteristics of the respondent

### Heterogeneity in Voter Decision Making

-   We should think of voter decision making as a dynamic process in which voters have a set of predispositions---existing beliefs, attitudes, interests, and attachments---and they are charged with the task of matching those predispositions with a candidateselection.

-   And Zaller (1992) and Converse (1964), of course, arguethat those with mid‐levels of sophistication are most likely to change their mind inresponse to new information.

-   partisan activation might be the main goal of the campaign.

    -   partisans are more influenced by campaign effects

### Heterogeneity in Campaign Messages

-   The volume and content of campaign messages will differ acrossgeographic areas, communication modes, and different households.

-   Who are campaigns targeting?

    -   debated a lot.

    -   who is receiving the message?

-   Democrats should focus on the issues onwhich their party has a strong performance record---education, health care, and socialsecurity, while Republicans should focus on the issues they "own"---taxes,national security, crime. Yet, recent research has challenged the idea that candidates areactually following such a strategy (Kaplan, Park, and Ridout 2006; Sides2006). And, of course, the content of the message is not likely to be static, it will likely change as thecandidates react to each other, polls, media, and the broader environment---anothersource of variation that has rarely been accounted for in academic research.

## Zingher, Joshua N. 2014. "An Analysis of the Changing Social Bases of America's Political Parties, 1952-2008." Electoral Studies. 35:272-82.

### Abstract:

In this article I address two interrelated questions: have the group bases of the American political parties changed over time and what factors have lead to the observed changes? I determine social group memberships significantly influence individual partisanship with a [multivariate analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/multivariate-analysis "Learn more about multivariate analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") using 56 years of ANES data. I then measure how many votes each politically relevant social group contributed to the party coalitions in each presidential election from 1952 to 2008. I discuss how group contributions have changed over time and establish the demographic and behavioral causes of group contribution change. I find that the party coalitions have been restructured as a result of groups' changing [voting behavior](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/voting-behavior "Learn more about voting behavior from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and the changing ratio of groups in the electorate.

### Bumper Sticker:

Group membership -\> party affiliation

-   What groups makeup the parties?

### Research Questions:

1.  How have the parties' social base changed over time?

2.  What social group memberships actually structure individual level voting behavior?

### Background

-   Descriptive paper

-   Only focused on group membership that is politically relevant.

    -   politically relevant groups as those group memberships that are statistically significant predictors of partisan identification, while groups that are not reference points have an effect that is statistically indistinguishable from zero.

        -   using vote choice instead of partisanship

![](Zingher.png){fig-align="center" width="606"}

-   The size of a group's contribution to a party's coalition is a product of three factors:

    -   Loyalty---the proportion of [group members](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/group-members "Learn more about group members from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that support the party

    -   Turnout---the proportion of group members that actually vote

    -   Size---the group's proportion of the total population

-   *I wonder how much of this is driven by certain group membership disappearing*

    -   union membership is declining.

### Exploring the sources of group contribution change

-   There are three reasons why a group's contribution could change over time:

    -   Conversion ---A group's loyalty to a party increases or decreases

    -   Mobilization---A group's rate of turnout increases or decreases

    -   Demographic Change---There are more or less voters in the group as a proportion of the total population compared to previous elections

### Results:

-   Some group memberships have a consistent and significant effect on vote choice across all (or nearly all) decades including---African Americans, Latinos, Jews, union members, whites, Protestants and Catholics.

-   The effect of some group memberships moves in a consistent direction over time as the group becomes consistently more Democratic or Republican. These groups include---white Southerners, the non-religious, weekly church attendees, college graduates, men and women.

-   Other group memberships never have a consistently significant effect on vote choice across all decades including---age group, birth cohorts, income category, urbanism and Asian.

## Part 3 of Controversies in Voting Behavior.\*

### Are Economic Factors Weakening as Vote Determinants?

-   What determines who people vote for?

-   Is economic voting still a thing? OR do people primarily base their vote off of other matters?

-   economics is a big deal - socio economic status

-   evaluations of the economy also important.

-   Class conflict?

    -   why has class conflict fallen away?

        -   Inglehart says industrialized nations have satisfied the basic needs of people and thus social issues can be focused on,

    -   Social issues \> class differences in voting

-   More cross pressure on social issues than economic issues.

-   **In addition, Campbell (2006) argues that "religious threat" is another feature of culture-war politics in the United States. He finds that evangelical voters are more likely to vote for Republican presidential candidates when they live in the presence of more secular people in their community.**

    -   interesting.

-   candidate competence is not seen as a big influence on vote

-   **Egotropic - focus on personal or household finances**

    -   pocketbook

-   **Sociotropic - focus on national economic conditions.**

-   economic evaluations are heavily influenced by partisanship.

-   Is class voting actually in decline?

    -   debate here.

-   economic voting is theorized to be stronger in countries and situations where voters clearly understand the responsibility of the national government.

    -   finds that economic voting is weaker in countries with multilevel governance, which tends to obscure the role of the national government.

        -   so federalism influences class consciousness.

-   Voters think very short term for economic retrospective voting.

    -   we read something about this in core related to economic voting

### The Political Condition of Economic Perceptions

#### Bumper Sticker:

-   Political pref influence economic evaluations

#### lit review

-   Economy is important for vote OR political perceptions color economic evaluations

-   The mechanisms through which political beliefs might impact economic perceptions are various: an expression of partisan loyalty, cognitive consistency needs, or simply a desire to maintain the appearance of consistency in the interview context are all possibilities.

-   **"Identification with a party raises a perceptual screen through which the individual tends to see what is favorable to his partisan orientation" (Campbell et al. 1960, 133).**

-   The findings from these panel data are clear: individuals' economic perceрtions may predict incumbent popularity when measured at the point of outcome, but they have much less direct impact when their relationships with earlier measures of popularity are taken into account. On the other hand, the impact of party popularity on economic perceptions is persistently strong even when previous measures of both variables are considered.

### Purple America

-   This whole argument is basically that economic voting and social issues on vote are like at the same level.

-   What is the source of geographical political division?

-   Authors challenge the culture war argument

-   Culture war argument:

    -   First, voters are polarized over moral issues, and this division maps onto important demographic categories like religious affiliation.

    -   Second, moral issues have more salience or weight in the minds of voters than economic issues.

    -   Third, this division accounts for red and blue cartography-red-state voters are moral conservatives who vote on moral issues without regard for their economic interests or preferences.

#### Results:

-   First, like other political scientists who have tackled this issue, we find that most Americans are ideological moderates on both economic and moral issues.

-   Second, our central claim is that economic issues have much more weight in voters' minds than moral issues.

-   Third, the differences in voting behavior between red states and blue states is driven at least as much by economic as by moral issue preferences.

-   In the General Social Survey, low-income Americans are significantly less inclined to vote based on moral values than are high-income groups. In fact, we find that higher-income voters are more inclined to rely on issues (economic and moral) in making their voting decisions.

## Kraft, P, M. Lodge, and C. Taber. 2015. "Why People 'Don't Trust the Evidence':Motivated Reasoning and Scientific Beliefs." Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science

### Abstract:

In this commentary, we embed the volume's contributions on public beliefs about science in a broader theoretical discussion of motivated political reasoning. The studies presented in the preceding section of the volume consistently find evidence for hyperskepticism toward scientific evidence among ideologues, no matter the domain or context---and this skepticism seems to be stronger among conservatives than liberals. Here, we show that these patterns can be understood as part of a general tendency among individuals to defend their prior attitudes and actively challenge attitudinally incongruent arguments, a tendency that appears to be evident among liberals and conservatives alike. We integrate the empirical results reported in this volume into a broader theoretical discussion of the John Q. Public model of information processing and motivated reasoning, which posits that both affective and cognitive reactions to events are triggered unconsciously. We find that the work in this volume is largely consistent with our theories of affect-driven motivated reasoning and biased attitude formation.

### Literature Review/Argument:

-   Scientific debates should be independent of partisan considerations.

-   individuals employ more skepticism toward scientific evidence as ideologies

    -   mainly conservatives.

-   There is a general tendency among individuals to defend their prior attitudes and actively challenge attitudinally inconvenient arguments.

#### Political Beliefs and Scientific Skepticism:

-   Blank and Shaw find that when scientific results conflict with a readily available alternative view, individuals are less likely to defer to the research.

    -   not just ideology and religiosity but also partisan identification!

-   Schuldt, Roh, and Schwarz show that partisan divide is contingent on questionnaire design, including wording and order effects.

    -   big difference in response between "climate change" and "global warming".

-   different findings point to two different explanations:

    -   partisan differences toward science may be driven by alternative beliefs and motivations individuals hold that

    -   Or individual response patters are contingent on contextual informational frames.

        -   the effect of framing is best understood if one takes into account the motivational processes engaged as people evaluate policy proposals.

            -   kinda a frank luntz argument here.

#### Putting Affect First: Motivated Reasoning and the John Q. Public Model:

-   **Individuals do not accept and internalize informational and contextual frames irrespective of their predispositions.**

-   John Q. Public model claims that these biases, and information processing in general, are driven by initial affect.

    -   the fundamental assumption driving our model is that both affective and cognitive reactions to external and internal events are triggered unconsciously, followed spontaenously by the activation of associateive pathways that link thoughts to feelings to intentions to behavior, so that very early events, even those that occur below conscious awareness, set the direction for all subsequent processing.

-   all thinking is suffused with feeling and these feelings arise automatically within a few milliseconds of exposure to a sociopolitical object or event.

-   spreading activation hypothesis

    -   activation from priors and incidental affect will spread along well-traveled "hot" associative pathways that link things together.

-   evidence is accumulating that attitudes and behavior arise from automatic, uncontrolled processes and are often set before we begin seriously "thinking" about them. If this is the case, deliberation serves to rationalize rather than cause our thinking, reasoning, and intentions.

-   deliberation is a product of unconsciously determined, affectively driven processes.

-   **How can the model described above account for the empirical findings on science denial?**

    -   hot cognition hypothesis: JQP posits that all social objects and concepts for which prior attitudes exist are affectively charged. Initial affective responses to a stimulus enter the decision stream before any and all conscious deliberations and thereby influence all down-streaming processes, such as the activation of certain considerations in memory, or related judgements and evaluations.

        -   how does that affect form? is it elite driven? Experience driven? Do we care? The affect arises if it is familiar or triggers those "hot pathways".

-   global warming and climate change have greater affective charge for republicans than democrats.

-   **However, the model presented in this commentary does not claim that individuals never revise their initial attitudes or are unable to overcome their initial affects, but JQP does suggest that persuasion is difficult and certainly more effortful than following the powerful affective currents down the stream of processing.**

-   overcoming this is difficult and as long as political elites align the debates along partisan lines rather than emphasizing the necessity of a common understand of the underlying issues.

## Lau, R. and D. Redlawsk. 2006. How Voters Decide: Information Processing During Campaigns. New York: Cambridge UP. Chapters 1-3; 5; 8.

### Chapter 1:

-   Democracy works IF citizens, voting for leaders who best represent their views, and holding those leaders accountable for their performance in office at the next election, make democracy work.

-   5 voter hypothesis:

    -   rational choice

        -   classic ecnomic perspective on rationality views humans as omniscient calculators or ambulatory encyclopedias.

            -   like an accountant.

    -   Downsian "constrained" rationality relying upon retrospective considerations

        -   similar to classic rat choice. but not as "psycho" .

            -   voter is constrained by time to look at all details.

                -   the voter optimizes their time.

            -   more info always better but this model at least realizes the cost of gathering all that info may exceed the marginal cost. Think Riker.

                -   these two rat choices are treated as one model.

    -   social-psych (michigan school)

        -   American Voter - Campbell

            -   most voters know/care very little about politics.

            -   Voter influenced by party identification.

            -   the funnel of causality

            -   voting decisions are strongly influenced by early-learned socail identifications, which, like all such identifications, tend to be accepted with little or no considerations or alternatives.

                -   these are not developed through rational self-interest.

                    -   these voters should not be affected by campaign effects like model 1 voters.

            -   information gather is not perfect.

    -   single issue

        -   model 3: fast and frugal decision making

            -   single issue

                -   easy issue voting

    -   cognitive psychological.

        -   Model 4: Bounded Rationality and Intuitive Decision Making

            -   low infromation.

                -   most deciscions are better understood as semiautomatic response to frequently encountered situatiosn than as carefully wweighed probabilistic calculations of the consequences associated with the different alternatives.

            -   voter in model 4 is similar to model 3 in that they are also cogntively limited information processors

            -   good v. easy decision.

-   **We argue that because a vote decision is based on information - even of the amount of information collected is limited - the failure of existing models of the vote decision to seriously consider how voters acquire and use information means we still do not have a very good understanding of how voters decide how to vote.**

#### Why does information processing matter?

-   the processes voters use can lead to better or worse decisions.

-   classic models of rationality do provide us a behavioral method for evaluating the quality of decisions.

-   **Did the voters, in the hurly-burly of an actual election campaign, with all the constraints imposed by real life, still manage to slect the candidate taht he or she would have chose in the ideal world of fully informed preferences?**

    -   this IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION!

#### Book Contributions

1.  they suggest a new way to look at the vote decision itself

    1.  does that decision, whatever it was, is (from the voter's own perspective) a correct one?

2.  Development of a new method: *dynamic process tracing*

    1.  helps us figure out how voters decide.

3.  the presentation and elaboration of a new framework for understanding voter decision making and the development of a new set of measures for studying it.

    1.  **voting is about information and thus understanding how people acquire and use information in making vote decisions is critical.**

### Chapter 2: A New Theory of Voter Decision Making:

-   Voter decision making CANNOT be much different from most other decisions people make in their daily lives.

-   How do people gather and use information?

-   Four IVs for Model:

    -   demographic background characteristics of voters

    -   political sophistication

    -   "task demands" or campaign factors

    -   the subjective of perceived "nature" of the decision task.

#### Human Cognition and its Limits

-   Humans are LIMITED information processors.

-   short term memory is the only part of memory where direct processing of information is possible.

-   the movement from info that is short term to longer term takes time and requires significant effort.

#### How do people deal with information overload?

-   Heuristics

    -   keep the information processing demands of the task within bounds.

        -   cognitive shortcuts

    -   availability

        -   judging frequency, probability, and causality by how easily concrete examples come to mind, or how easy is is to generate a plausible scenario

    -   representatives

        -   assigning specific instance to broader categories (Stereotypes) according to how well the particular instance fits the essential properties of one category rather than another

    -   anchoring and adjustment

        -   forming a tentative response and then adjusting by reviewing relevant data.

-   Categorization

    -   when new stimuli is perceived, the first thing people try to do is categorize the stimuli as another instance of some familiar group

        -   it allows large parts of the stimuli to be ignored if it matches a categorization

#### How do voters make decisions?

These don't always lead to better decisions!

-   Decomposition

    -   breaking a decision down into its component parts, each of which are presumably easier to evaluate than the entire decision.

-   Editing

    -   aka pruning

        -   simplifying a decision by eliminating otherwise relevant aspects of the decision

-   Using Decision Heuristics

    -   simplifying the choice between alternatives.

        -   **on vote decision:**

            -   Affect Referral

            -   Endorsements

            -   Familiarity

            -   Habit

            -   Viability

-   **goal is to minimize effort and make decisions that are good enough. That ratio is key.**

-   Behavioral decisions theory is concerned with the dynamic conditions of *how decisions are made.*

-   Rat choice focuses on the structure or elements of a decision.

-   models 1 - 4 are actually decision strategies if you think about it.

-   2 types of decision strategies in elections (where tradeoffs have to occur):

    -   Compensatory

        -   strategies are cognitively

    -   Noncompensatory

        -   incomplete information search to avoid conflict

#### How can we tell what strategy a voter is using?

-   The key to answering this is understanding how people acquire information because this will influence heuristics and how make choices.

-   Focus: How information is gathered and combined to reach a decision.

    -   need to know information search variables

        -   Depth of Search

            -   how much of the available info is considered before a decision is reached.

        -   Comparability of Search Across Alternatives

        -   Sequence of Search

            -   how decision makers move from learning about one candidate/attirubte pair to another.

                -   Alternative-based search

                -   attribute based search

                -   Inter-attribute, inter-alternative

                -   Intra-attribute, intra-alternative

            -   ordered info is preferable = cognitively easier.

                -   This leaves me to wonder how information is presented in different contexts. The above 4 are still use but how individuals acquire info may change drastically based on the medium in which it is delivered.

![](lau_redlawsk_theory.png){fig-align="center"}

#### Background characteristics influential in voting

-   Political sophistication/Expertise

    -   experts are better at using cognitive shortcuts.

-   Campaign factors

    -   time pressure

    -   similarity to alternatives

-   sophistication, campaign factors, and background characteristics of the voter, combine to form a subjective perception of the voting task.

#### Memory

-   How information is processed

    -   quantity

        -   depth of search

    -   accuracy

#### Distinguishing Evaluations and choice

-   judgment $\neq$ decision making

    -   1\) judgement involves the evaluation of a single entity along some dimension

        -   a decision, involves a choice between two or more discrete alternatives

    -   2\) people make many decisions without first explicitly evaluating hte alternatives on some global dimension. "spur of the moment"

    -   3\)

-   Why do we care?

    -   different strategies can yield different choices.

    -   How information is gathered affects how it is stored in memory, which in turn affects the probability that it will be recalled (and what else will be recalled with it) at the time of a decision.

### Chapter 3: Studying Voting as a Process

-   Amount of information and type of information available vary across elections.

-   research gap in understanding how decision strategies are utilized.

-   need to study decision making while the decision is made

#### Process-Tracing Methodologoes for Studying Decision Making

-   Verbal; protocols:

    -   decision maker is asked to "think aloud" while he or she is making some decision, to vocalize "every passing though"

        -   not crazy about this

-   Information board:

    -   these present subjects with a matrix of "learnable" information.

        -   Where the alternatives under consideration are the columns of the matrix, and the different attributes of choice are the rows.

            -   however the cells of the matrix are blank

                -   we can follow the movement of the mouse

    -   These are good because we gain a controlled environment in which every action taken by the decision maker can be observed and recorded.

    -   Eye tracker technology makes this super interesting to use now.

        -   I wonder how an experiment could get at this

-   Created a mock presidential election campaign including eight candidates.

    -   subjects asked to imagine that they were voting in the upcoming election.

-   experiment manipulated the attractiveness and gender, timing, number, and nature (tone) of campaign advertisement.

#### Internal Versus External Validity:

-   Experiments are good but they force us to make tradeoffs about validity.

-   **Internal Validity:**

    -   refers to the extent to which the conclusions about causality that one wishes to draw from the study are valid

        -   experiments have a lot of external validity

-   **External Validity:**

    -   refers to generalizability

        -   the extent to which the conclusions reached in the laboratory apply in other settings

-   Experiment needs to mimic modern campaign environments

    -   lots of information

#### Subjects:

-   subjects be eligible to register and vote in U.S. elections

-   they not be currently enrolled in a college or university.

-   research thought for stone:

    -   eye track with process tracing for something like chat

### Chapter 5: What Voters Do - A First Cut

-   Goals of this chapter:

    -   describe what voters in our mock election campaigns actually did.

    -   describe the actual measures and operationalizations of the information processing and search variables described at a more conceptual level in Chapter 2, which provide the windows for looking (if not actually getting) inside the heads of our voters.

-   primary and general elections yielded very different results.

-   absence of party affiliation in primaries is a big driver.

#### How Much Information Did Voters Gather?

-   Primary Campaign:

    -   holding the number of candidates running a party's primary, there is more search devoted to in-party candidates than to out-party candidates.

    -   for both in and out party, search per candidate is greater when there are only two candidates running a primary.

    -   search is not equal across candidates.

-   General Election Campaign:

    -   less stuff accessed than primary.

#### White Kinds of Info did voters gather? The Content of Search:

-   Not all info was equally available.

-   info was categorized

    -   Person

    -   Hoopla and Horse Race

    -   Issues

    -   Party

    -   Endorsements

#### Memory:

-   The greater the structure to the information search is - the more candidate-based and/or attribute-based search a person utilizes - the greater the memory becomes.

-   Memory is important in the on-line processing model

    -   on-line argues that memory plays little or no role in the vote choice, or rather the only role ofr memory is retrieving the running tally evaluations of the competing candidates.

#### Decision Strategies:

-   there is more total search devoted to a party when there are four rather than two candidates running that party's primary.

-   if the same number of attributes is considered about every candidate, the inter-alternative variance will be very small; if the amount of information gathered about the candidates differs widely, however, that variance will be relatively high.

    -   high variance is associated with low equality across alternatives and vice versa.

-   sequence of search

    -   ratio of intra to inter attribute transitions.

### Chapter 8: Evaluating Candidates

-   we examine how voters evaluate candidates and how they choose among them.

-   three goals

    -   1\) examine the question of on-line versus memory-based evaluation.

    -   2\) just because we might know which candidate a voter evaluates most highly, we do not necessarily know which candidate that voter will choose in an election.

        -   evaluation and choice are not the same thing!

    -   3\) we will consider the effects of decision strategy on global candidate evaluation.

#### On-line model

-   an impression

    -   = an efficient summary of the information is rememebered, but the specific information upon which it is based is much less important to retain.

-   runny tally.

-   voting is simply a matter of comparing the running tally for each candidate and choosing the one more positively evaluated.

-   Is candidate evaluation purely on-line?

    -   how much does memory play?

        -   its is part of the calculus in primaries.

-   people did not vote for the candidate with the highest on-line evaluation.

-   memory does matter

-   the more positive the memories of the most highly evaluated candidate are, the less likely the voter is to defect from that candidate, while the probability of defection increases dramatically when memory affect favors some other candidate.

-   **What we do argue is that whatever the memories maintained and then recalled, they have a profound effect on how voters evaluate candidates.**

    -   is this because the memory makes the something salient in the immediate context and thus brings greater weight?

        -   i guess then they are still right because what the voter chooses to remember is very important.

            -   **I wonder about longer term events**

                -   the tally becomes more useful cognitively overtime.

-   punchline: on-line and memory matter.

### Abstract:

Misinformation occurs when people hold incorrect factual beliefs and do so confidently. The problem, first conceptualized by Kuklinski and colleagues in 2000, plagues political systems and is exceedingly difficult to correct. In this review, we assess the empirical literature on political misinformation in the United States and consider what scholars have learned since the publication of that early study. We conclude that research on this topic has developed unevenly. Over time, scholars have elaborated on the psychological origins of political misinformation, and this work has cumulated in a productive way. By contrast, although there is an extensive body of research on how to correct misinformation, this literature is less coherent in its recommendations. Finally, a nascent line of research asks whether people's reports of their factual beliefs are genuine or are instead a form of partisan cheerleading. Overall, scholarly research on political misinformation illustrates the many challenges inherent in representative democracy.

### Background/Lit Review:

-   **Misinformation: when people hold incorrect factual beliefs and do so confidently.**

-   Kulinski et al. (2000) is the big unconditional text for this lit.

-   misinformed people base their political opinions on inaccurate beliefs

    -   think about lau and redlawsk here

-   Misinformation $\neq$ belief in rumors and conspiratorial thinking

    -   rumors are statements that lack specific standards of evidence but gain credibility through widespread social transmission.

    -   conspiratorial thinking explain political or historical events through references to "the machinations of powerful people"

-   Focus is on misinformation as defined as: incorrect, but confidently held, political beliefs.

### What Causes Political Misinformation?

-   Different types of psychological motives

    -   accuracy motive: a desire to make the correct decision.

    -   directional motives: the desire to arrive at a specific conclusion, one that maintains consistency with one's attitudes.

        -   individuals use both of these but it varies based on context.

-   parties impart strong direction goals

-   tension between accuracy and directional

    -   JQP model: all objects we encounter as part of our daily life are infused with affect, with positive feelings for liking and negative feelings for disliking.

-   peoples processing goals change across situations.

### Overcoming Misinformation Through Correction:

-   Correction should be difficult because people cling to misinformation for both motivational and cognitive reasons.

    -   motivational basis if it stems from a person's desire to arrive at a specific conclusion

    -   may also be cognitivie and easily retrievable in memory.

-   Correcting methods?

    -   alternative factual account is effective

    -   credibility of source.

    -   Also, it is paramount that corrective efforts not boost the familiarity of misinformation.

        -   "Obama is not a Muslim"

    -   no good/effective correction.

-   processing goals also influence corrective efforts.

-   So under what conditions will correction be successful for misinformation?

    -   two factors

        -   issue type

        -   source of corrective message

### The Role of Issue Type

-   On issues or topics that are closely connected to one's partisan/ideological identity, one will be motivated to process information in a way that preserves those attachments.

-   **Corrections will be more successful when accepting the retraction does not threaten a person's worldview or a cherished attitude.**

### The Source of the Corrective Message

-   in addition to the topics, the source is important for correction.

-   Berinsky (2017) found that a corrective message about ACA death panels is most effective at changing beliefs when it is attributed to a Republican compared to either a Democrat or a nonpartisan source.

-   In the case of the Berinsky and Bode & Vraga studies, the corrective messages were effective precisely because the threat to a person's ideological commitments was reduced or absent (

### Remaining Gaps in the Literature

-   do we measure or manipulate misnformation?

-   it remains hotly debated whether failed correction---and especially backfire effects--- are asymmetric across liberals and conservatives.

-   it is notoriously difficult to identify the standard for a successful correction, particularly when the dependent variable is an attitude.

### Lesson from Psychology

-   Invalidated information is not simply deleted from memory because memory does not work like a whiteboard, and retractions do not simply erase misinformation.

-   Continued influence Effect: CIE arises from cognitive mechanisms that allow false information to influence the reasoning process even after that information has been discredited.

### Measurement: Confidently Wrong or Expressive Responding?

-   The more inaccurate people's beliefs about welfare, the more certain they felt about being correct.

-   Regular inclusion of confidence-in-knowledge measures would both improve the classification of these items (e.g., ignorance versus misinformation) and increase our ability to generalize across studies

    -   this might have been good with barber and pope. Not sure what im getting at but I feel there is something I am circling around here.

-   Expressive responding is thought to occur when there is a difference between the response formed by a respondent (their true belief) and the one they report in a survey.

-   The question of whether mistaken factual beliefs are genuine or whether some statements of belief are a product of partisan cheerleading is crucial to address because the answer has implications for the solutions that scholars devise.

## Enders et al. 2022. "Are Republicans and Conservatives More Likely to Believe Conspiracy Theories?" Political Behavior

### Abstract:

A sizable literature tracing back to Richard Hofstadter's *The Paranoid Style* (1964) argues that Republicans and conservatives are more likely to believe conspiracy theories than Democrats and liberals. However, the evidence for this proposition is mixed. Since conspiracy theory beliefs are associated with dangerous orientations and behaviors, it is imperative that social scientists better understand the connection between conspiracy theories and political orientations. Employing 20 surveys of Americans from 2012 to 2021 (total n = 37,776), as well as surveys of 20 additional countries spanning six continents (total n = 26,416), we undertake an expansive investigation of the asymmetry thesis. First, we examine the relationship between beliefs in 52 conspiracy theories and both partisanship and ideology in the U.S.; this analysis is buttressed by an examination of beliefs in 11 conspiracy theories across 20 more countries. In our second test, we hold constant the content of the conspiracy theories investigated---manipulating only the partisanship of the theorized villains---to decipher whether those on the left or right are more likely to accuse political out-groups of conspiring. Finally, we inspect correlations between political orientations and the general predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories over the span of a decade. In no instance do we observe systematic evidence of a political asymmetry. Instead, the strength and direction of the relationship between political orientations and conspiricism is dependent on the characteristics of the specific conspiracy beliefs employed by researchers and the socio-political context in which those ideas are considered.

### Bumper Sticker

Conspiratorial symmetry.

### Research Question

-   Is there evidence for the asymmetry theory in conspiracy beliefs.

-   Are those on the political right more likely than those on the left to believe in conspiracy theories?

-   Does the *relative size* of the relationship between motivated conspiracy theory endorsement and political orientations vary depending on whether the purported conspirators are Democrats or Republicans?

### Hypothesis:

-   We argue that contradictory findings are the result of researchers' choices and assumptions.

-   There are inconsistent findings across this literature

    -   we posit that inconsistencies across findings are partially due to the concept of conspiracy theory itself.

### Background/Theory:

-   Hofstadter argues that REpublicans and conservatives are more likely to believe conspiracy theories than Democrats and liberals.

-   Something to note: there is a large qualitative difference across conspiracies. The conspiracies that republicans may believe in are not necessarilly or should be compared at the same level as democrat conspiracy theories.

-   A conspiracy theory is an explanation of an event or circumstnace that accueses powerful actors of working in secret for their own benefit, against the common good, and in a way that undermiens bedrock societal norms, rules, or laws.

-   **belief in conspiracy theories are often a reaction to elite political discourse.**

-   Given that elite cues and motivated reasoning appear to similarly affect both Republicans/conservatives and Democrats/liberals

-   **The last five years have witnessed Republican elites in government and media (most notably Donald Trump) utilizing conspiracy theories in a way unprecedented in the last half century of American politics, and with severe, deleterious consequences for democratic institutions. This alone has encouraged renewed conjecture about an asymmetry in conspiracy theory beliefs. However, elites are an imperfect reflection of the public----they have different goals, incentives, and knowledge about politics. Moreover, elite rhetoric rarely *changes* predispositions, such as conspiracy thinking, so much as it *activates* predispositions and *connects* them to salient political choices (Leeper & Slothuus, [2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9307120/#CR36)). In other words, while Republican elites may have recently activated conspiratorial predispositions among supporters in the mass public----where they exist----in a way that Democratic elites did not, they are unlikely to be able to cause once non-conspiratorial supporters to become highly conspiratorial.**

-   We encourage future work to integrate the conspiratorial rhetoric of elites with studies of mass beliefs and investigate elite conspiratorial rhetoric from actors including and beyond Donald Trump.

### Finding 1: The Relationship between Conspiracy Theory Beliefs and Political Orientations Depends on the Conspiracy Theory

-   There is political balance in belief of conspiracy theories

-   They add a fake conspiracy theory to see if Republicans would believe in it despite it being completely made up

    -   this is the treatment basically.

-   lots of variability across countries.

-   The relationship between political ideology and conspiracy theory beliefs appears to be dependent on both the details of the conspiracy theories *and* socio-political context.

-   Furthermore, even though Finding 1 involves more conspiracy theory beliefs than previous studies, our findings remain an artifact of which conspiracy theories researchers investigate because there is no "correct" or "representative" set of conspiracy theories that researchers should employ.

### Finding 2: The Political Left and Right Both Accuse the Out-Party of Conspiring

-   Survey experiment

-   testing motivated reasoning.

-   Keeping conspiracy theory constant and then varying the party identification of the conspirator beliefs.

-   we expect that Republican/conservative respondents would be more likely to endorse the "Democrats are conspirators" version of the questions

    -   vice versa

-   A similar pattern emerges for ideology. In four of the 10 tests, the correlations are not statistically significantly different from one another. In the remaining six, *liberals* engage in greater motivated conspiracy theory endorsement than conservatives.

-   we find no support for the hypothesis that those on the right are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories that impugn liberals than liberals are to endorse the exact same conspiracy theories when they impugn conservatives.

### Finding 3: Conspiracy Thinking is Unsystematically Related to Political Orientations

-   focus on general predisposition to engage in conspiracy theorizing.

-   4 item conspiracy thinking scale

-   We found only mixed evidence for the proposition that strong partisans or extreme ideological identifiers exhibit higher levels of conspiracy theorizing than weak identifiers or moderates/independents

### Results

-   Across multiple surveys and measurement strategies, we found more evidence for partisan and ideological symmetry in conspiricism, however operationalized, than for asymmetry.

-   By fusing social media data with survey data researchers can gain greater leverage over questions about the conditions under which online behaviors are reflective of, or even impact, beliefs and offline behaviors.

-   face to face mobilization literature - look at Gerber and Green 2000

-   why decrease in voter turnout if we have increased franchisment?

-   declining everywhere

-   less engagement in politics

### Markus Prior: News vs. Entertainment

-   chance encounters with political stuff decreases as there is more variation in entertainment.

-   political knowledge gain has been asymmetrical.

-   less emphasis on socioeconomic factors of digitral divide.

-   greater media choice leads to greater voluntary segementation of the electorate.

-   "The preference-based gaps documented in this article are self-imposed as many people abandon the news for entertainment simply because they like it better. Inequality in political knowledge and turnout increases as a result of voluntary, not circumstantial, consumption decisions."

-   premise: people's media environment determines the extent to which their media use is governed by content preferences.

-   accidental exposure was easier back in the day because people were "glued" to their television.

-   the greater ability to shift to other channels/entertainment has made accidental exposure harder.

## Burden et al. 2014. "Election Laws, Mobilization, and Turnout: The Unanticipated Consequences of Election Reform." American Journal of Political Science.

### Abstract:

State governments have experimented with a variety of election laws to make voting more convenient and increase turnout. The impacts of these reforms vary in surprising ways, providing insight into the mechanisms by which states can encourage or reduce turnout. Our theory focuses on mobilization and distinguishes between the direct and indirect effects of election laws. We conduct both aggregate and individual-level statistical analyses of voter turnout in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections. The results show that Election Day registration has a consistently positive effect on turnout, whereas the most popular reform-early voting-is actually associated with lower turnout when it is implemented by itself We propose that early voting has created negative unanticipated consequences by reducing the civic significance of elections for individuals and altering the incentives for political campaigns to invest in mobilization.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   Reforms should include election day registration **AND** early voting.

### Research Question

-   Does election day registration increase voter turnout?

-   Does early voting increase voter turnout?

-   Do these reforms combined increase voter turnout?

    -   this is basically called "same-day registration"

### Background

-   Cost on voting

    -   direct

        -   legal framework

    -   indirect

-   stimulation arises from informal sources: local media, intentional recruitment by family, acquitanaces, coworkers, etc.

    -   Verba, Scholzman, and Brade 1995 - read this for informal recruitment discussion.

-   "For at least some voters, what gets them to the polls is the stimulation of the day's news, observation of activities at polling places, and conversations with friends and neighbors. Local news coverage, discussions with peers, and election day activities all help spur turnout by providing information about candidates and the process of voting, introducing some normative pressure to vote, and enhancing the social benefits of taking part in a collective enterprise. When these activites are diluted, or at least redistributed over time, so is the stimulating effect, particularly for the peripheral voter." p.3 - important cite for walkability.

-   face-to-face interactions that mark election day voting create social capital and draw potention voters to the polls (Arceneaux, Krousser, and Mullin 2012; Fortier 2006; Funk 2010; Kropf, Swindell, and Wemlinger 2009; Thompson 2004)

-   voting habits publicizied increases turnout gerber green and lerimer.

-   "Rolfe's (2012) emphasizes on the social rather than individual roots of voter turnout helps us understand these experimental effects. For Rolfe, voting is primarily a social act in which a person's decision to vote is conditional on the turnout of others. People embedded in broader social networks with more mobilizing agents are thus more likely to be prodded to vote (see also Bond et al. 2012).

-   social pressure is less powerful in early voting. takes away the hype of election day and thus the socialization factor.

## Fowler, J. 2006. "Altruism and Turnout." Journal of Politics. 68: 674-683.

### Abstract:

Scholars have recently reworked the traditional calculus of voting model by adding a term for benefits to others. Although the probability that a single vote affects the outcome of an election is quite small, the number of people who enjoy the benefit when the preferred alternative wins is large. As a result, people who care about benefits to others and who think one of the alternatives makes others better off are more likely to vote. I test the altruism theory of voting in the laboratory by using allocations in a dictator game to reveal the degree to which each subject is concerned about the well-being of others. The main findings suggest that variation in concern for the well-being of others in conjunction with strength of party identification is a significant factor in individual turnout decisions in real world elections. Partisan altruists are much more likely to vote than their nonpartisan or egoist peers.

### Bumper Sticker

-   New term in voter calculus model just dropped.

### Research Question

-   Do people with more altruism (care for others) have higher voter turnout?

### Background

-   this is not the D term

-   altruism model suggests that people who care about the welfare of others will vote only if they think one of the alternatives is superior.

### Dictator Game

-   Purpose: we need a measure of how much people value the welfare of others.

-   Game: In this game, the experimenter gives player 1 a certain amount of money and then asks the subject to divide that money between herself and player 2.

    -   If player 1 is motivated only by her own economic gain, she should keep all the money for herself and allocate nothing to player 2. This is not what players normally do.

    -   In other words, the more a player cares about the well-being of others, the more she will allocate to the other player in the dictator game.

### Data

-   N=350

    -   undergrad political science class

-   18-27 years old

-   Incorporating partisanship into the altruism theory of voting yields two main predictions. First, increasing concern for others will increase the probability that citizens vote, but only if they think the election matters. Thus, altruism should affect the turnout of partisans more than nonpartisans.

## Fowler, James H., Laura A. Baker, and Christopher T. Dawes. 2008. "Genetic Variation in Political Participation." APSR 102:233-48

### Abstract:

The decision to vote has puzzled scholars for decades. Theoretical models predict little or no variation in participation in large population elections and empirical models have typically accounted for only a relatively small portion of individual-level variance in turnout behavior. However, these models have not considered the hypothesis that part of the variation in voting behavior can be attributed to genetic effects. Matching public voter turnout records in Los Angeles to a twin registry, we study the heritability of political behavior in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The results show that a significant proportion of the variation in voting turnout can be accounted for by genes. We also replicate these results with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and show that they extend to a broad class of acts of political participation. These are the first findings to suggest that humans exhibit genetic variation in their tendency to participate in political activities.

### Research Question:

### Hypothesis:

-   a significant portion of the variation in voter tunrout behavior can be attributed to genetic factors.

### Background:

-   Twin study

-   comparable environment assumption

    -   people disagree about how similar environments are for identical and fraternal twins.

-   critical assumtion: mz and dz twins share comparable social environments.

-   this is all still kind of a black box. What is the mechanism. What is it about genes?

    -   no mechanism

        -   once a mechanism is identified, does this not lead us back to only social factors which are the things we can change?!

-   Monte Carlo

## Plutzer, Eric. 2002. "Becoming a Habitual Voter: Inertia, Resources, and Growth in Young Adulthood." APSR 96:41-56.

### Abstract:

This paper reframes our inquiry into voter turnout by making aging the lens through which the traditional resource and cost measures of previous turnout research are viewed, thereby making three related contributions. (1) I offer a developmental theory of turnout. This framework follows from the observation that most citizens are habitual voters or habitual nonvoters (they display inertia). Most young citizens start their political lives as habitual nonvoters but they vary in how long it takes to develop into habitual voters. With this transition at the core of the framework, previous findings concerning costs and resources can easily be integrated into developmental theory. (2) I make a methodological contribution by applying latent growth curve models to panel data. (3) Finally, the empirical analyses provide the developmental theory with strong support and also provide a better understanding of the roles of aging, parenthood, partisanship, and geographic mobility.

### Background:

-   age = inertia.

    -   development in voting process

-   costs are minimized as you get more experienced.

-   residential mobility is a big barrier

    -   young individuals that move have to deal with that cost more often.

### Data:

-   student-parent socialization study

-   funnel of causality = IVs

    -   Demographic and Parental Characteristics

        -   sex

        -   race

        -   parents SES.

            -   education

            -   family income

            -   occupational prestige for head of household.

    -   Youth Characteristics at the completion of High School

        -   GPA

        -   activity in student organization

        -   church attendance

    -   Events and achievements between High School and the First Election

        -   disruptions

            -   attended college

            -   marriage

            -   became a parent

            -   moving

    -   Life Events and achievements after the first election.

        -   economic status, marriage, parenthood, community ties, engagement, political knowledge

### Findings:

-   parental influence overtime decreases with each subsequent election.

-   home ownership no effect on voter turnout

-   one of the limitations is that this only looks at presidential level turnout.

Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users\' friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between \'close friends\' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks.
```

### Research Question:

-   Can online networks, which harness social information from face-to-face networks, can be used effectively to increase the likelihood of behaviour change and social contagion.

### Hypothesis:

-   Political behavior can spread through an online social network

-   mobilization should spread more effectively online than strong ties.

### Background:

-   Close ties? weak ties?

### Data:

-   randomized controlled trial with all users of at least 18 years of age in the USA who accessed Facebook website on 2 November 2010, the day of the US congressional elections.

-   Users were randomly assigned to a "social message" group, an 'informational message' group or a control group.

    -   social message group

    -   info group n = 611,044

        -   shown message, poll info, counter and button, but not shown faces of friends

    -   control group n = 613,096 did not receive any message at the top of their feeds.

-   To test weak ties:

    -   to distinguish users who are likely to have close relationships, we used the degree to which Facebook friends interacted with each other on the sites.

    ```         
    -   higher levels of interaction indicate that friends are more likely to be phisically proximate and suggest a higher level of commitment to the friendship,
    ```

### Results:

-   social message were 2.08% more likely to click on the I Voted button than those who received the informational message.

    -   also .26% more likely to click the polling-place information link the users who received the informational message.

-   seeing people's faces in the treatment increased voting.

-   treatment effects increases as tie-strength increases.

-   ordinary Facebook friends may affect online expressive behaviour, but they do not seem to affect private or real-world political behaviours. In contrast, close friends seem to have influenced all three.

-   weak ties didn't seem to have a big effect or any effect at all for that matter.

-   Our validation study shows that close friends exerted about four times more influence on the total number of validated voters mobilized than the message itself.

-   **Online mobilization works because it primarily spreads through strong-tie networks that probably exist offline but have an online representation. In fact, it is plausible that unobserved face-to-face interactions account for at least some of the social influence that we observed in this experiment.**

    -   I wonder, at the time of this study, online usage was a bit different than now. I wonder if things have changed.

## Carlson, Taylor. 2019. "Through the Grapevine: Informational Consequences of Interpersonal Political Communication." American Political Science Review.

### Abstract:

Much of the US public acquires political information socially. However, the consequences of acquiring information from others instead of the media are under-explored. I conduct a "telephone-game" experiment to examine how information changes as it flows from official reports to news outlets to other people, finding that social information is empirically different from news articles. In a second experiment on a nationally representative sample, I randomly assign participants to read a news article or a social message about that article generated in Study 1. Participants exposed to social information learned significantly less than participants who were exposed to the news article. However, individuals exposed to information from someone who is like-minded and knowledgeable learned the same objective facts as those who received information from the media. Although participants learned the same factual information from these ideal informants as they did from the media, they had different subjective evaluations.

### Research Question:

### Hypothesis/Argument:

-   I argue that social information transmission could still have a meaningful impact on opinion.

### Background:

-   More information available than ever.

    -   but very little actually read the news

        -   see Prior.

-   Two-step flow of information

    -   information flows from the media, to the interested individuals known as opinion leaders and to others.

-   Information gets distorted in the two step flow.

-   Those who received information from an "ideal informant" someone who was relatively more knowledgeable and shared their partisanship, learned the same amount as those who received information from the media, even though the social message was substantially shorter than the news article.

-   Socially transmitted information is likely to be less precise and contain fewer units of information than information communicated by the media itself.

-   Question I have of this article so far - how is information being transmitted socially?

    -   what about repeated frequent exposure?

### Method:

-   Tests to see how information changes as it moves through the telephone game.

-   Then conducts an experiment where participants are randomly assigned to receive information generated by a news source or another person, using messages generated in the first study.

-   Focus on news articles about economic performance.

#### Study 1:

-   How info changes

-   participants read reuters article on econ performance.

-   After reading the article, participants were asked to write a message telling another person about the article that they just read. The intended recipient of the message was manipulated such that participants were randomly assigned to write their message to a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent.

    -   THIS IS ODD TO ME?!

        -   First, they are writing the message. Second, they are writing the message to a specific person of a party. This is not necessarily how info gets communicated?

-   differences in tone. socially generated information can be prone to partisan biases absent in information from the media.

#### Study 2:

-   Consequences of these differences by examining changes in information recall and subjective evaluations after exposure to a randomly assigned information treatment

-   4 treatment groups - these came from the media or another person - these come from the first study.

    -   media

    -   democrat informant

    -   republican informant

    -   independent informant

-   participants are randomly assigned the treatment.

-   DVs: the amount of objective information participants learned and the change in subjective evaluations

    -   learning is measured by calculating the change in the number of questiosn about information communicated in the original Reuters article

-   IVs: Information Source Treatment

    -   did they get info from media or another person

-   Ideal and non-ideal informants.

    -   an ideal informant is one who has the same partisanship as and is more knowledgeable than the recipient.

-   Controls:

    -   control for political knowledge

        -   measured using the number of standard American government knowledge questions that participants could correctly answer

            -   these are sourced from the ANES - four question.

                -   The questions were as follows: (1) "Do you happen to know how many times an individual can be elected President of the United States under current laws?" (2) "For how many years is a United States Senator elected---that is, how many years are there in one full term of office for a US Senator?" (3) "What is Medicare?" and (4) "On which of the following does the US federal government currently spend the least?"

-   Results:

    -   media treatment answered more questions correctly after exposure.

    -   social treatments also learned from the information after exposure but did not do as well as the media treatment.

    -   Ideal informants had a significant impact on participants than participants that did not have an ideal informant treatment.

    -   No difference in learning between those who received information from an ideal informant and those who received information from the media, even though social generated information is substantially different from and shorter than the news article.

#### Other:

-   Breaking apart the two conditions of being an ideal informant (knowledge and copartisanship), we see that there was no difference in motivation based on knowledge level, but those who wrote to copartisans were significantly more likely to report that they were trying to objectively inform than those who wrote to out-partisan

-   Then moves to test subjective evaluations of the economy and the president

    -   "I expect that participants will have more negative evaluations of the economy and of President Trump after exposure to a message from a Democrat, while participants in the Republican Informant condition will have more positive evaluations of the economy and President Trump.

-   regardless of partisanship, participants in the social treatments did not significantly alter their economic confidence when exposed to socially supplied information about the economy. However, in the media treatment, only Democrats and Independents had significantly lower economic confidence after exposure to the news article; Republicans were not influenced by the news article.

### Abstract:

Theory: A theory of political communication is employed which stresses the importance of citizen discussion beyond the boundaries of cohesive groups for the dissemination of public opinion.

Hypotheses: If the social communication of political information is bounded by cohesive social groups and strong social ties, we should expect the social flow of political information to be independent from opinion distributions in the larger environment. In contrast, when social communication extends beyond socially cohesive groups, the flow of information should reflect these opinion distributions.

Methods: We analyze a 1992 election survey which includes a battery of questions regarding the construction of respondents' social networks. The analysis is undertaken with respect to opinion distributions in the larger environments (counties) where the respondents reside.

Results: Individuals are differentially exposed to larger environments of opinion depending on micro environmental patterns of social interaction and political communication. Hence, the construction of a citizen's social network serves as a filter on the macro environmental flow of political information. In this way, the consequences of the larger environment of opinion depend on the existence of micro environments which expose citizens to surrounding opinion distributions.

### Bumper Sticker:

The primary task of this paper is the identification of communication patterns that serve to create and transmit public opinion.

### Research Question:

-   To what extent do cohesive social groups and weak social ties serve to advance or retard the communication and dissemination of public opinion in the larger environment?

-   How social networks of political communication serve as micro environmental filters on the macro environmental flow of information.

-   Does the social communication of political information occur beyond the boundaries of socially cohesive groups?

-   Does such communication expose individuals to the larger environment of public opinion?

-   Side Question: Do people with proportionately more non-relative discussants demonstrate larger effects due to the climate of opinion withini their counties of residence.

### Background:

-   "Neither individual preference nor the environment is solely determinate, and thus the information that citizens ultimately obtain through social channels of communication is contingent on the particular intersection between the individual and the environment. The nature of this intersection, in turn, depends on the construction of the citizen's social network-a micro environmental filter that might expose individuals to, or seclude them from, these larger environments of information."

    -   the supply of information sources varies across environments in systematic ways.

-   Implicit assumption in political science is that social influence is highest in closed social cells.

-   intimacy becomes a precondition for influence.

-   Authors don't disagree with the role of close ties/intimacy in network but argue there is room for more.

-   Huckfeldt and Sprague (1991, 1995) show that South Bend residents engage in discussions of the campaign with others who are less than intimiate x associates.

-   When social communication occurs through weak ties, beyond the boundaries of cohesive groups, public opinion becomes more fully public.

-   Individual exposure to particular viewpoints is subject both to environmental supply and to the citizen's own political preferences.

-   While political discussion occurs frequently within socially cohesive groups, communication that occurs across the boundaries of cohesive groups may be more crucial to the dissemination of public opinion.

### Methods:

-   the relationship between individual exposure and the environmental supply not only in terms of individual preference, but also in terms of the construction of social networks and groups.

-   Need information on individuals, their networks of social communication, and the partisan composition of their surrounding environments.

-   First they do a survey of american pop after 1992 presidential election

-   second, scoial network data are colllected for each of the respondents in order to characterize the political bias of socially communicated information to which the respondent is exposed

-   Third, individuals and their networks are measured with reference to distinctive environments that are external to the individual

    -   measured at the county level.

-   Name generator

    -   weak tie vs. strong tie in network.

    -   80% of all the discussants come from four sources: family, work, church, and neighborhood.

        -   political discussion occurs beyond the boundaries of cohesive groups

-   Then asked respondents what they think their network politically supported

    -   perceptions vs actual level of political support.

-   higher proportions of non-relative discussants enhance the magnitude of the county effect on perceived Clinton support in respondents' micro environments.

### Results:

-   Table 4 demonstrates a micro environmental filter on the macro environmental flow of information. Those citizens whose patterns and habits of social interaction are contained within the bounded, cohesive confines of the family are also secluded from socially communicated information that is distinctive to the larger environment. In this sense, then, they are cut off from the informational consequences of divergent public opinion distributions, and their own opinions are uninformed by the partisan composition of the larger environment.

-   people with more non-relative discussants were also likely to have more discussants who were not close friends-an indicator that they were more weakly tied to their discussants (Granovetter 1973), and perhaps as a consequence, more directly tied to the larger climate of opinion.

    -   a second question here would be perfect: HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THIS PERSON? TELEPHONE, DIGITALLY, FACE-TO-FACE?

        -   county is too big of a unit but oh well.

-   **Citizens who are connected socially to non-relatives are also more highly integrated politically within the prevailing flow of public opinion.**

    -   who are these people?

-   micro environments are important! How they are constructed!

-   WALKABILITY INCREASES THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPLY!

    -   but it isn't just supply that is the mechanism. There is nuance to the supply argument because the internet has obviously increased supply and that has been problematic in numerous ways.

-   There is a danger to the individual isolation arising from mass society, it arises because people are not exposed to these larger environments of opinion

    -   they are digitially but less so geographically (now)

-   politics is no longer anchored in the local

    -   see hopkins.

        -   we've grown more individualistic through DIGITAL interaction. There is something about face-to-face interaction.

### Abstract:

No factor appears more powerful in explaining how individuals evaluate political information and form political preferences than partisanship. Yet, virtually all work on the effects of partisanship on preference formation neglects the crucial role of social settings. In this study, I examine how social settings can fundamentally change the influence of partisanship on preferences. I demonstrate that, in fact, social settings exert an independent influence over preference formation---one that is even larger than the influence of partisan ambivalence. The central implication of these findings is that, going forward, we cannot fully explore how citizens apply their partisanship in evaluating political information without also accounting for the social settings in which individuals find themselves.

### Hypothesis:

1.  Overall, univalent (i.e., less ambivalent) partisans express a stronger preference for attitudinally congruent information (i.e., their own party's policy) than do ambivalent partisans

2.  a\) Respondents in homogeneous groups engage in more partisan-motivated reasoning and prefer policy solutions that more closely represent their own party's policy, as compared with those in nonsocial settings.

3.  b\) Respondents in homogenous groups perceive their own party's policy to be more effective, and the opposing party's policy to be less effective, as compared with those in nonsocial settings.

4.  a\) Respondents in heterogenous groups engage in less partisan-motivated reasoning and are more favorable toward the opposing party's policies, as compared with those in non-social settings.

5.  b\) Respondents in heterogenous groups perceive their own party's policy to be less effective and the opposing party's to be more effective, as compared with those in nonsocial settings.

### Background:

-   Partisanship - an individual's adherence to a particular political party or platform-tends to be highly stable over one's lifetime.

### Design

-   undergrad sample

    -   379 students

    -   formed two partisan groups.

-   2 policy issues to evaluate

    -   energy and health care policy.

-   does not have them report network composition. I like this. because it is an experimental design, she randomizes composition.

-   Three DVs for partisan motivated reasoning:

    -   preferred policy choice on a 7 point scale

    -   efectiveness of each party's policy on a 7 point scale

    -   respondents selected their ideal discussion group according to ideological composition on a 7 point scale.

### Results

-   In the company of heterogeneous others, motivated reasoning is drastically tempered, and when respondents are among like-minded copartisans, partisan-motivated reasoning is considerably enhanced.

-   partisan univalence increases partisan-motivated reasoning

-   Starting on the left, homogeneous groups lead to perception of extreme ineffectiveness for the Republican energy solution among both univalent (2.56) and ambivalent (2.95) partisans. Heterogeneous groups in both cases lead to more positive assessments of the Republican policy, both for univalent (3.42) and ambivalent (4.1) partisans. On the right side, we see the same pattern: homogeneous social settings lead to more negative evaluations among univalent (3.63) and ambivalent (3.95) partisans, whereas heterogeneous settings improve these evaluations for both groups (4.84 among univalent partisans, 5.13 among ambivalent partisans).

    -   exposure to disagreement more deliberate and tolerant

        -   but decreases political participation.

### Abstract:

At the center of debates on deliberative democracy is the issue of how much deliberation citizens experience in their social networks.These "disagreements about disagreement" come in a variety of forms, with scholars advocating different empirical approaches (e.g., Huckfeldt, Johnson, and Sprague 2004; Mutz 2006) and coming to different substantive conclusions. We address these discrepancies by going back to the basics: investigating the consequences of conceptual and measurement differences for key findings relating interpersonal political disagreement to political attitudes and behaviors. Drawing on the 2008--2009 ANES panel study, we find evidence that different measures of disagreement have distinct effects when it comes to individuals' preferences, patterns of engagement, and propensities to participate. We discuss the implications for the study of social influence; as interpersonal disagreement can mean different things, scholars should think carefully about how to study it and should exercise caution when making pronouncements about its empirical and democratic consequences.

### Research Question:

1.  What are the potential ways to determine when discussion can be classified as disagreeable?

2.  Does the choice of threshold matter for the conclusions we draw with respect to political behavior?

### Background

-   two analytical problems of interpersonal political disagreement

    -   inadequate conceptualization and measurement of the core concept.

        -   poli sci needs to be better at studying disagreement.

    -   methodological problems related to causal inference.

-   At what point do political conversations become disagreeable and start affecting political behavior?

-   is disagreement just absence of agreement?

### IV

-   political discussion network through a name generator

    -   "During the last six months did you talk with anyone face-to-face, on the phone, by email, or in any other way about government or elections, or did you not do this with anyone during the last 6 months.

        -   ugh i want someone to parse out the differences in the medium of communication.

-   Disagreement

    -   one measure:

        -   respondent's perception of how much disagreement is occuuring in his or her network (general disagreement)

    -   second measure

        -   based on respondent's report of the partisan leanings of her discussants (partisan disagreement)

### DV

-   Exposure to interpersonal political disagreement and a number of different meausres of political preferences and behavior.

-   DV1

    -   strength of respondents' political preferences.

-   DV2

    -   is concerned with how civically engaged respondents were over the course of the 2008 election.

-   DV3

    -   political engagement and participation.

### Results

-   women are less likely to be embdedded in disagreeable networks than men

-   the data suggest that individuals in disagreeable networks---conceptualized in terms of general disagreement---are more politically engaged, but more agnostic about their political leanings when compared to individuals in agreeable networks.

-   In short, then, the results indicate that individuals who perceive general disagreement have weaker political preferences, while individuals who experience disagreement measured by a lack of shared partisan preferences have stronger political preferences.

## Rolfe, M. 2012. Voter Turnout. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press\* (chapter 6, tbd)

-   agent-based modeling

    -   simulates complex systems

### Social Theory of Voter Turnout

-   conditional decision makers vote because campaigns mobilize them, either directly or by creating discussion that works through networks to spur conditional decision makers to act.

    -   she contrasts this with Verba, Brady, and Schlozman (1995) resource based theory of voter turnout.

        -   individuals choose to vote because they can, they like to, and they are asked.

            -   this is a cost/benefit analysis story

-   Argument:

    -   1\) I provide a more complete exposition of my claim that all turnout is mobilized.

    -   2\) I then demonstrate that the social theory of turnout can account for a wide variety of previously documented empirical observations about turnout. These prior observations include aggregate patterns such as cross-national variation and cross-election variation, and individual-level correlations with political interest, civic resources, and requests to participate.

    -   3\) Finally, the conclusion of this chapter lays out ground where the social theory and resource-based view diverge, setting the stage for empirically testing the theories against one another in the chapters to follow.

-   Campaigns increase salients which are reverberated through social networks.

-   Political discussion is likely to be casual or incidental; a mention of a candidate or an issue might serve as an indicator of interest or involvement.

-   Specifically, in the social theory of turnout, I assume that voters are more likely to cooperate unconditionally in lower-cost elections - an assumption supported by subject behavior in experiments. Thus, the social theory of turnout provides a sound theoretical account of the effects of costs on turnout, and has the advantage of producing empirically verifiable estimates of how costs affect decision making. Furthermore, the point estimates of how costs affect turnout in a cross-national setting obtained from simulations are eerily accurate, providing further support for the ability of the social theory of turnout to explain empirical turnout patterns.

    -   what does she mean by unconditional?

-   I show that variation from each of these sources can be explained as the result of mobilization-induced changes in political discussion and other visible signals of political awareness or interest.

-   strategic politicians are at the root of almost all voter participation.

-   knowledge of an election "buzz" -\> increases discussion in networks

-   salience equals network size !!!!!!

-   Lower salience does not equal higher cost

-   I argue that all turnout is, in a sense, mobilized, with much of the mobilization occurring indirectly through increases in political discussion and general visibility of the upcoming election among potential voters. In this section, I introduce the final factor that accounts for individual turnout variation - latent differences in the potential of individuals to be mobilized indirectly - and argue that these latent differences are rooted in the differences in social structure that, in fact, cause much of the variation in individual turnout probabilities.

-   How does indirect mobilization work? Although I cannot pin down this process as precisely as might be ideal, we can speculate that citizens communicate to each other their own level of involvement in the political system through a variety of means, and that this communication increases the effective size of the social network relevant to the turnout decision.

-   Regardless of the conversational content, however, exposure to higher levels of political discussion, I suggest, increases the likelihood of voting. In terms of the model of social decision making, additional discussion increases the size of the reference group used by a citizen when deciding whether or not to vote, thus in effect increasing the size of one's social network.

### Abstract:

*We investigate the sources of an important form of social inequality: the social processes by which men and women acquire participatory resources in organizations. In particular, we investigate the extent to which men and women acquire civic skills and are targets for political recruitment within churches. Integrating theory about social interaction within an organizational structure, we hypothesize that the ways in which women gain politically relevant resources from the church are simply different from those of men. Three factors explain the institutional treatment of women in churches: (1) women's political contributions are devalued; (2) women respond to social cues more than men do; (3) women respond to political cues from clergy---especially female clergy---whereas men do not. Our findings of gender differences in civic resource acquisition provide a more nuanced treatment of the mobilization process and have broad implications for the relationship between political difference and participatory democracy*.

### Question

1.  Do women participate in resource building church activities at differentrates than men?

2.  Are women recruited to participate in politics at lower rates than men?

3.  And most importantly, how does the social structure of congregations and women'sorientations to politics contribute to these patterns?

### Argument

-   The assumption that all citizens gain equally from their organizational involvements is suspect.

-   Gender differences in civic resources from church :

    -   women's political contributions are devalued

    -   women respond to social cues more than men do and in different ways

    -   women respond more than men to political cues from clergy-especially female clergy.

### Background

-   Ties into Mutz. less interaction of women means less cross-cutting relationships.

-   The most acknowledged finding of the social interaction approach is that exposure to political differences within a discussion network depresses political participation

    -   is this right?

### Data

-   2400 clergy members

-   We operationalize civic skills as the practice of one or more of four activities in the past year: writing a letter, giving a speech or presentation, planning a meeting, and studying or discussing a political issue with a group.

### Determinants of Political Resource Acquisition

-   Organizational Engagement

-   Social Network Composition

-   The Role of Clergy

-   Community Orientations

## Einstein et al. 2018. "Who Participates in Local Government? Evidence from Meeting Minutes." Perspectives on Politics.

### Abstract:

Scholars and policymakers have highlighted institutions that enable community participation as a potential buffer against existing political inequalities. Yet these venues may bias policy discussions in favor of an unrepresentative group of individuals. To explore who participates, we compile a novel data set by coding thousands of instances of citizens speaking at planning and zoning board meetings concerning housing development. We match individuals to a voter file to investigate local political participation in housing and development policy. We find that individuals who are older, male, longtime residents, voters in local elections, and homeowners are significantly more likely to participate in these meetings. These individuals overwhelmingly (and to a much greater degree than the general public) oppose new housing construction. These participatory inequalities have important policy implications and may be contributing to rising housing costs.

## Hertel-Fernandez, A. 2017. "American Employers as Political Machines." Journal of Politics. 79(1).

### Abstract:

American employers are increasingly engaging their workers in the political process. Drawing on original surveys of f irms and workers, this paper examines the extent to which employers act as political machines, channeling their employees into politics in ways intended to support corporate interests. I show that employer political requests greatly increased the likelihood that employees would report participating in politics around the 2014 election and employer requests were roughly as effective as those from unions and political parties. I also find that employer mobilization was most effective when employers used warnings of job loss to motivate participation and when employers could monitor the behavior of their employees, suggesting that employers are indeed acting as a type of political machine. My results shed light on the ways that American firms recruit workers into politics and show that employer mobilization of workers may be an important source of political power for business.

### Bumper Sticker

-   Employers are political machines

### Argument:

-   The political machine literature helpfully draws our attention to the ways that machines can use two strategies--- **monitoring** and **threats of economic losses or reward**s---to increase individuals' responsiveness to machine political requests. I argue that a similar focus is appropriate in the American context, as employers are making use of these two relatively unusual tactics in recruiting their employees into politics.

### Background:

-   businesses have always been some kind of machine

    -   only back then they could use violence and was more overt

-   clientalism

    -   political organizations can mobilize support for candidates by providing targeted benefits or using physical or economic threats to change voter behavior, dubbing these organizations political machines.

-   Using the political machine framework, we can think of American employers as using their relationship with workers to channel support to elect specific candidates and pass legislation that benefits the firm.

-   Monitoring

    -   important because employers need to know if they voted and if voted correctly.

    -   need to also monitor other activities:

        -   legislative contacting, contributions to political campaigns, and volunteering for political candidates and parties

    -   **The individual-level prediction from this framework is that workers will be more responsive to employers' political requests if they believe their employer has the capacity to closely monitor their attitudes and behaviors for fear of politically motivated reprisal.**

### Data:

-   2015 CCES

-   My main outcome is a sum of these five participatory acts (Participation Index). The median worker in the 2015 CCES had engaged in one participatory act.

-   "How likely is it that your employer can track your political behaviors and attitudes, such as keeping track of whether you voted or which candidates you support?"

    -   IV: Employer monitoring

-   I therefore asked if workers received a warning that their employer might need to cut jobs or close plants along with managers' political messages

    -   threat

-   To capture the context of recruitment, I account for the Cook Partisan Voting Index of respondents' districts, indicating how much a district's share of the twoparty presidential vote deviated from the national average over the 2008 and 2012 election cycles (Cook Political Report 2013)

## Makse, Minkoff, and Sokhey. 2019. Politics on Display: Yard Signs and Politicization of Social Spaces. Oxford University Press.\* (chapters, tbd- skim)

### Chapter 3:

In this chapter, we explore a variety of factors that influence an individual's decision to display a campaign yard sign. First, we consider the displaying of signs from the perspective of traditional models of political participation. Using national data from the 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we explore demographic and attitudinal predictors of sign displaying, as well as measures of the political environment, such as residence in a swing state. Then, relying on our observational data from the 2008 and 2012 elections, we turn our attention to more localized factors that may encourage or inhibit the displaying of signs. In keeping with recent contextual work, we explore linkages between property traits, neighborhood traits, and the displaying of signs. Finally, we consider personality and whether individuals who display signs share traits such as the desire to make one's views known and the propensity to initiate political conversations.

-   Looking at the model's predictions, we see an interesting set of social and political factors emerge: stronger ideologues and stronger partisans are more likely than others to report displaying a sign

-   We expect that households will be more likely to display a sign in highly participatory social spaces, a result supported by studies of participation generally and at least one study that references the displaying of signs specifically ([Kenny 1992](javascript:;)).

-   One of the premises of this book is that some people view their neighborhoods as a politicized social space, and it stands to reason that there are two distinguishing traits of individuals who take that view: high levels of political engagement and a personality conducive to externalizing the primacy of politics.

-   If we view sign displaying as a communicative act, somewhat akin to starting a conversation (or even as a provocation), we might expect displayers to initiate conversations more often than those who participate in politics less publicly and less communicatively.

### Chapter 6:

In this chapter, we confront the stereotype of the "yard sign war" in which the politically engaged respond to their neighbors' displays by displaying signs of their own. Another possibility, one that is more consistent with our understanding of social interaction, is that households feel empowered by the presence of same-party signs and deterred by the presence of other-party signs. Focusing on the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, we look for evidence of these patterns in our geo-coded observational data of sign display. To assess these competing characterizations, we introduce two measures: a clustering measure that describes the distribution of a single sign across a sample space and a joint clustering measure that captures the similarity of two signs' spatial patterns. Overall, we find little evidence of yard sign wars and consistent evidence that Democratic and Republican signs inhabit distinct spaces in neighborhoods.

-   In this chapter, we focus on patterns such as these, seeking to elucidate why different patterns of sign displaying emerge across neighborhoods.

-   Tobler's First Law of Geography ([Tobler 1970](javascript:;)) states that "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things." This applies to political participation in general, as near individuals are more likely to be subject to similar political conditions than far ones *and* near individuals are likely to have made decisions about where to live based on common attributes.

-   Similarly, sorting may occur not just on the basis of political preferences, but on the basis of political involvement. We lack direct evidence that individuals choose neighborhoods due to participatory norms, but [Hopkins and Williamson (2012)](javascript:;) argue that participation is driven by design features of neighborhoods, particularly in suburbia. If individuals sort by political persuasion and neighborhood design is inextricably linked with engagement, it is no great leap to imagine that individuals may by clustered together on the basis of neighborhood engagement.

-   In other words, we see no evidence that in-person contacts by campaigns were systematically concentrated in certain areas of the Broomfield research site.

-   The findings are highly consistent: sign patterns of competing presidential candidates exhibit disjoint clustering, meaning that households displaying Democratic signs are less likely to have Republican signs as their nearest neighbor than we would expect, and vice versa.

-   Having accounted for the prevalence of yard signs in the neighborhood, we find that the impact of voter turnout among one's neighbors is reduced. Undoubtedly, this is because both of these are capturing a similar factor: neighborhood political participation. However, the fact that sign prevalence is predictive of sign displaying above and beyond the contextual turnout measure gives us confidence that sign prevalence is not merely a proxy for neighborhood participation.

    -   interesting?

-   It may be the case that some individuals display signs in defiance of neighbors who support another candidate, but neither the spatial analyses nor the regression models are consistent with the notion that this is the modal behavior. Indeed, put in the language of our earlier analyses, when people are motivated by the desire to "let their neighbors know where they stand," it is far more likely that they are communicating a message of solidarity rather than a message of dissent or defiance---that is, a message of support for their in-group

### Chapter 8:

In this chapter, we investigate how the prevalence of signs influences social spaces. We begin by exploring how signs impact perceptions of a neighborhood's activism and partisan balance and, more specifically, whether signs make those perceptions more, or less, accurate. Second, using a hypothetical scenario in which respondents are asked to consider a neighbor who supports the opposing candidate, we consider how signs shape interactions among neighbors. Third, we analyze the relationship between sign prevalence and how individuals interact with their neighborhood discussion partners. We focus on two key metrics: whether individuals discuss politics with greater frequency during the campaign than they do otherwise, and whether they report *heated* discussions with their neighbors. Leveraging ego-centric network batteries---a tool commonly used to analyze interpersonal influence but rarely used to analyze neighborhood-specific networks---we find several patterns consistent with the notion that the mere presence of yard signs structures patterns of political discussion in neighborhoods.

-   In these extreme spaces, we might expect individuals to socialize differently with people who live around them.

-   When it comes to perceptions of activism, the overall presence of signs might inform residents about the neighborhood. However, with perceptions of partisanship, signs for each party should push perceptions in opposite directions. Thus, we expect that more Democratic signs will lead to the perception that the neighborhood is more Democratic and that the opposite will hold for Republican signs.

-   **That is, does the politicization of space also have an influence on whether and how citizens talk with the people who share spaces with them?**

-   Sign displays can potentially affect social interactions in *at least* two ways. First, they can directly affect the relationships among discussion partners, invoking feelings of solidarity or causing tension when one---or both---members of the dyad have a sign on their front lawn, making politics a more conspicuous topic. Second, signs in the social context can influence *all* relationships among people in that space, regardless of whether both, one, or neither of the individuals is a sign displayer.

-   We find some evidence that the neighbor networks of sign displayers are a bit distinctive, but signs seem to call everyone to conversation

### Abstract:

Criminal justice contact is increasingly routine for Americans, and preemptive policing tactics render contact a feature ofeveryday life for minorities and the poor. Scholars interested in the impact of criminal justice contact on politicaloutcomes largely ﬁnd that all types of contact decrease voting and trust in government. Yet, qualitative evidence suggeststhat sometimes individuals are mobilized by their experiences. I leverage theoretical differences between custodial citizenship and having a loved one who is a custodial citizen, referred to as proximal contact, to identify the conditions underwhich criminal justice experiences catalyze political action. Individuals with proximal contact face fewer barriers toparticipation than do custodial citizens, and when they view negative experiences as a product of a system that targetspeople like them on the basis of group afﬁliation, contact can spur participation in activities other than voting.

### Question:

-   Under what conditions (if at all) does proximal criminal justice contact increase engagement?

### Argument:

-   I argue that while politicalaction catalyzed by contact may include voting, it is mostlikely to manifest nonelectorally.

### Background:

-   Custodial Citizenship: Personal contact via arrest and incarceration

-   Proxmial contact: knowing someone whos is a custodial citizen

-   **If you believe the custodial citizen is a target of some systematic bias = mobilize.**

-   Scholars leverage theories of political learning to argue that contact, both personal and proximal, is politically demobilizing

    -   less voting

-   This research contends thatcollective racial identity develops from a shared history withinstitutional discrimination

    -   linked fate

### Research Design:

-   National Crime and Politics Survey 2013

-   American National Election Studies 2016

### DV: Political Participation

-   participation battery

### IV: Contact and Justice

-   Proximal contact is main IV

    -   "What about someone you know, such as a close friend or family member? Do you know someone who has been arrested, charged or questioned by the police, even if they weren't guilty, excluding minor trafﬁc stops such as speeding?"

        -   NCPS

    -   The 2016 ANES asked: "In past 12 months anyfamily membered stopped/questioned by the police?" About 20% of all respondents indicated they had proximal contact,which reached 27% among blacks. Proximal contact is coded dichotomously (0 = no contact, 1 = proximal contact)

-   NCPS also asks about sense of injustice

    -   basically perceptions of police and if their actions are justifiable

### Results:

-   The ﬁndings presented here support the argument that asense of injustice underlies the positive association between contact and participation.

-   Findings demonstrate that proximal criminal justice experiences increasenegative evaluations of community police and perceived discrimination. I further offer evidence for the claim that a sense of unfairness, and the belief that one was targeted bycriminal justice policy on the basis of race, class, and place,motivates political action

## *The Oxford Handbook of Political Participation* (2022), edited by Giugni and Grasso: Chapter 2: Political Science and Political Participation, *Kay Lehman Schlozman and Henry Brady*

The right of citizens to participate freely in political life is essential to democracy. \* Acting on their own or with others, online or off, citizens in democracies can engage in a variety of acts with the intent or effect of influencing government, either indirectly through participation in the electoral process or directly through expressions of preferences. Although the menu varies from place to place, participatory acts include, most importantly, voting, as well as contacting a public official, signing a petition, attending a protest, joining a political party or an organization that takes stands in politics, working in a campaign, attending a rally, or donating money to a campaign or political cause. 1 When they take part, citizens can influence who holds governmental power and what they do with it, communicate preferences and needs for government action to public officials, and hold them accountable for their actions.

### Resources, Mobilization, and Psychological Factors

-   Why don't people take part in politics?

    -   They can't

    -   they don't want to

    -   nobody asked

-   Education and income are important

-   One argument says education is actually a sorting mechanism

    -   placing those who achieve educationally into occupational situations and social networks that facilitate political participation.

#### Because They Want To: Psychological Orientations

-   Political participation:

    -   Political Interest

    -   Political Efficacy

    -   Political Information

    -   Strength of Partisanship

    -   Strong commitment on a political issue

-   Causality is hard to tease out - very endogenous with everything

-   Big 5 personality traits

    -   extraversion

    -   agreeableness

    -   conscientiousness

    -   emotional stability

    -   openness to experience

#### Because Somebody Asked: Political Mobilization

-   easier to recruit because of internet (suspect about this)

-   Requests to take part politically arise from a variety of sources: through social media, or in a sermon at church, or from the newsletter of an organization of which one is a member, or directly from a friend, neighbor, or co-​ worker. Because those who attempt to get others involved in politics act as "rational prospectors," the ordinary processes through which people are asked to take part do not ameliorate the class bias in individual political voice.

#### Individuals in Context

-   Experiences in the family, at school, in the workplace, in voluntary organizations, and in church affect the resources, motivations, and exposures to political mobilization that, in turn, affect political participation.

-   political learning

-   intergenerational transmisssion - family background

-   In sum, at least in the United States, children who have the good fortune to be born to well-​ educated, affluent parents are not only more likely to grow up in a politically stimulating environment but also more likely as adults to achieve positions and statuses that facilitate political participation.

#### The Context of Political Institutions

-   Laws - literally instituional factors

-   history explanations

-   policy makes politics

#### Does Political Participation Matter

-   policymakers do not seem to seek out and respond to information about the preferences and needs of lower-​ income constituents. In fact, they seem to be especially responsive to upper-​ income constituents---​ in particular, to donors.

## Brown and Enos. 2021. \"The Measurement of Partisan Sorting for 180-Million Voters.\" Nature Human Behavior.

### Abstract

Segregation across social groups is an enduring feature of nearly all human societies and is associated with numerous social maladies. In many countries, reports of growing geographic political polarization raise concerns about the stability of democratic governance. Here, using advances in spatial data computation, we measure individual partisan segregation by calculating the local residential segregation of every registered voter in the United States, creating a spatially weighted measure for more than 180 million individuals. With these data, we present evidence of extensive partisan segregation in the country. A large proportion of voters live with virtually no exposure to voters from the other party in their residential environment. Such high levels of partisan isolation can be found across a range of places and densities and are distinct from racial and ethnic segregation. Moreover, Democrats and Republicans living in the same city, or even the same neighbourhood, are segregated by party.

### Background

-   A large proportion of US voters live with very low levels of residential exposure to neighbours from the other party.

### Data/Methods

-    For each of *n* = 180,660,202 geocoded individuals, we measure the distance to their *k* = 1,000 nearest neighbours as defined by the closest geodesic distances from the registered voters\' residences, creating a distance measure for *n* × *k* (over 180 billion) dyadic relationships. Thus, for every voter, we identify how near they live to each of their 1,000 nearest neighbours and combine this information with data on their neighbours\' partisanship to construct individual-level measures of partisan exposure and isolation.

-   partisan exposure weighted by distance to individual.

### Abstract:

Does contact across social groups influence sociopolitical behavior? This question is among the most studied in the social sciences with deep implications for the harmony of diverse societies. Yet, despite a voluminous body of scholarship, evidence around this question is limited to cross-sectional surveys that only measure short-term consequences of contact or to panel surveys with small samples covering short time periods. Using advances in machine learning that enable large-scale linkages across datasets, we examine the long-term determinants of sociopolitical behavior through an unprecedented individual-level analysis linking contemporary political records to the 1940 U.S. Census. These linked data allow us to measure the exact residential context of nearly every person in the United States in 1940 and, for men, connect this with the political behavior of those still alive over 70 years later. We find that, among white Americans, early-life exposure to black neighbors predicts Democratic partisanship over 70 years later.

### Bumper Sticker:

-   Early life exposure to diversity is important for later politics!

### Background

-   World is more diverse

-   Does interpersonal relationships reduce prejudice?

### Results: 

-   Using an empirical strategy of increasingly fine-grained geographic comparisons to account for sorting at small levels of geography, we show that white men who had a black neighbor in 1940, compared to white men who did not, are more likely to be associated with racially liberal politics, as indicated by their registration with the Democratic Party even as late as 2017.

## McCarty et al. 2018. "Geography, Uncertainty and Polarization." Political Science Research and Methods.

### Abstract

Using new data on roll-call voting of US state legislators and public opinion in their districts, we explain how ideological polarization of voters within districts can lead to legislative polarization. In so-called "moderate" districts that switch hands between parties, legislative behavior is shaped by the fact that voters are often quite heterogeneous: the ideological distance between Democrats and Republicans within these districts is often greater than the distance between liberal cities and conservative rural areas. We root this intuition in a formal model that associates intradistrict ideological heterogeneity with uncertainty about the ideological location of the median voter. We then demonstrate that among districts with similar median voter ideologies, the difference in legislative behavior between Democratic and Republican state legislators is greater in more ideologically heterogeneous districts. Our findings suggest that accounting for the subtleties of political geography can help explain the coexistence of polarized legislators and a mass public that appears to contain many moderates.

### Question:

1.  Is the mass public responsible for ideological polarization in legislatures

    1.  thrust of previous lit on this question is NO.

        1.  elites polarized first then the public.

2.  Why would electoral competition in these pivotal but heterogeneous districts generate such polarized legislative representation?

    1.  The remainder of the paper develops a simple intuition: relative to a homogeneous district where voters are clustered around the district median, candidates in such heterogeneous districts face weaker incentives for platform convergence due to uncertainty about the ideology of the median voter.

### Background

-   Theory: who argue that policy-motivated candidates might adopt divergent positions in the face of uncertainty about voter preferences. When candidates are uncertain about the ideological location of the median voter, they shade their platforms toward their or their party's more extreme ideological preferences.

-   **MAIN ARGUMENT: Voter heterogeneity produces more uncertainty about the median voter and therefore more polarization.**

-   Based on our findings, we find it quite plausible that the rise of polarization in the US Congress has been driven in part by increasing within-district heterogeneity associated with the demographic and residential transformations of recent decades

-   The most internally heterogeneous districts are those in the middle of the ideological spectrum.

### Results:

-   Heterogenous districts have the largest divergence

-   also look at elections in same year

    -   results still hold

    -   district heterogeneity and legislator partisan divergence are quite strongly related

-   **Our key findings can be summarized as follows. Partisan polarization within state legislatures emerges in large part from the fact that Democrats and Republicans represent districts with similar mean characteristics very differently. We have discovered that these differences are especially large in districts that are most internally heterogeneous. Further, we have discovered that these internally diverse districts are especially prevalent in the ideologically "centrist" places that most frequently change partisan hands in the course of electoral competition.**

## Strickler, Ryan. 2016. \"A \'Sorted\' America? Geographic Polarization and Value Overlap in the American Electorate.\" Social Science Quarterly.

### Abstract: 

Geographic political polarization is an increasingly salient topic of academic and popular discourse. Using Bill Bishop's bestseller The Big Sort as a foil, this article tests the claim that America has split into "ideologically inbred" "red" and "blue" communities. Method. Drawing on Bishop's concept of "landslide" Democratic and Republican counties, the article uses survey data to measure the overlap in opinion between respondents from opposing "landslide" counties. This is done both graphically and with a quantitative measure developed by Levendusky and Pope (2011). Results. Across economic, social, and cultural value dimensions, there is vastly more common ground than difference between respondents from "landslide" Democratic and Republican counties. Conclusion. Hyperbolic claims of a "sorted" country aside, geographic polarization in the United States is limited at best. Partisan polarization could be a real and consequential phenomenon in the electorate, but it has little geographic, "red versus blue" manifestation.

### Bumper Sticker

-   Geographical sorting isn't really going on and people have more in common than THEY THINK!

### Background:

-   If the country is sorted, it implies the gridlock in Washington is not the result of cynical political elites, activists, and media.

    -   BUT a genuine reflection of the public sentiment

-   Author argues there is common ground in political values between "landslide" democrat and republican counties.

-   I think geographic sorting is a post hoc result of polarization.

### Measuring Polarization

-   Should we care about the opinions of people or their party id?

-   The value statements used in this analysis are also more appropriate than using self-reported ideology, as the public is often more attracted to the symbolism of ideological labels than to their actual policy implications (Ellis and Stimson, 2012).

-   create an index

### Landslide Respondents

-   To test whether the country is geographically polarized along the value dimensions created above, each of the survey respondents was grouped into one of four categories---"landslide Democratic," "competitive Democratic," "competitive Republican," and "landslide Republican." Respondents were coded in the "landslide" Democratic (Republican) category if the margin of victory for the Democratic (Republican) candidate in their county for the 2012 election was 20 percent or greater. If the Democratic (Republican) candidate won a plurality with less than a 20 percent margin, the respondent is coded in the "competitive" Democratic (Republican) category.

-   There is difference...but also a lot of overlap.

### Unit of Analysis: 

-   County level

-   they try others.

### Discussion 

-   Sorting is overblown

-   we look at opinion but the connection to opinion and candidate needs to be explored

    -   sure there may be overlap - but savy candidates exploit those differences and make them salient.

-   Sure...they share commonality - but they don't perceive that shared common ground.

    -   a natural question is how much do these people interact with each other and the result of that?

    -   the fact they they share overlap is interesting but if we still elect more extreme candidates - it may be due to the lack of interaction to help individuals realize their common ground.
