# Week 1 - Introductions

-   It is important to develop our own instincts about what is good and what is not good work in the field.

-   Field is generally divided by behavior and institutions.

    -   behavior is really about mass behavior and how people act.

    -   Institutions is behavior of elites and actual politicians.

    -   Sometimes you have other areas of research that kind of link between.

-   Behavior -\> institutions -\> linkages -\> other topics.

## Assignments:

-   Response papers - 5 of them - any week.

    -   1\) identify over arching question of the week. What is big picture question?

    -   2\) identify favorite and least favorite reading for week.

        -   justify it.

-   Propose research for a week.

    -   Pick weeks that are closer to your heart.

    -   Pitch to Josh a research design that adds to the literature.

# Week 2 - Recent Research in the Subfield

## In-Class Notes:

-   All articles seem to reference polarization.

-   These all seem to be "headline" articles.

-   lots of survey data.

-   More authors is the trend.

-   Fowler:

    -   Is congress polarizing because the public is polarizing? Or is it other things?

    -   Fowler asks about policy preferences.

-   Good papers establish topline relationship

    -   can we establish the mechanism holds?

## [Fowler, Anthony, et al. 2023. "Moderates," American Political Science Review.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/moderates/71A6A9BD7EC7A5C94F975703417F866F)

### Abstract:

Moderates are often overlooked in contemporary research on American voters. Many scholars who have examined moderates argue that these individuals are only classified as such due to a lack of political sophistication or conflicted views across issues. We develop a method to distinguish three ways an individual might be classified as moderate: having genuinely moderate views across issues, being inattentive to politics or political surveys, or holding views poorly summarized by a single liberal--conservative dimension. We find that a single ideological dimension accurately describes most, but not all, Americans' policy views. Using the classifications from our model, we demonstrate that moderates and those whose views are not well explained by a single dimension are especially consequential for electoral selection and accountability. These results suggest a need for renewed attention to the middle of the American political spectrum.

### Bumper Sticker:

Moderates need to be classified better and deserve more focus

### Research Question:

How can we better identify moderates?

Why (from a survey perspective) are people moderate?

### Background:

-   We typically think of moderates in the following:

    -   politically unsophisticated

    -   uninformed

    -   politically incoherent

    -   secretly partisan

    -   ideologically cross pressured

    -   extreme, with patterns of attitudes poorly by a single ideological dimension

-   There are obvious survey issues in trying to figure out if someone is a moderate.

### Method:

-   Sort classically identified moderates into three subgroups of moderate type:

    -   those who have genuinely centrist views that are well summarized by a single underlying ideological dimension (spatial)

        -   Downsian voters
            -   live in single dimension.
        -   $Pr(y=1) = F(\beta_j(x_i-\alpha_j)$
            -   $x_i$ is the ideological position
            -   $\alpha_j$ is issue

    -   those who are inattentive to politics or the survey (unsophisticated)

        -   random/incoherent views. The way in which they select answers has no coherence and basically makes no sense.

            -   special stats here but basically if they are showing to have a .5 probability for selecting either survey response question - that is essentially random and they are probably an inattentive voter.

    -   those who hold genuine views that are not well summarized by a single ideological dimension (someone whose preferences are neither unsophisticated nor well summarized by the spatial model and, second, an ideology score on the liberal--conservative dimension were the respondent to be a spatial type (#1 above).)

        -   Conversian respondents (named after Philip Converse)

            -   genuine position holders but not well described in a left-right orientation.

            -   voters that care about specific stuff -\> which might translate into a lack of a wide-ranging belief system.

            -   They discriminate between thus if $\neq$ .5 relative likelihood then they are probably a conversian moderate.

                -   issue by issue responses not correlated with each other. Less than .5

                -   not completely guessing but no complete structure.

            -   no clear structure.

-   Assumes responses are perfect representations of preferences

    -   The issues have been ordered such that if a Downsian gives a conservative answer on issue one, he or she will necessarily give a conservative answer on issues two and three, and so on such that the three questions divide Downsians at three points along the ideological spectrum.

    -   Questions are also ordered by popularity.

        -   this ordering and assumptions allows them to figure out who is a "downsian" voter

            -   if they conflict with the Guttman scale - that is probably not a downsian voter.

### Data:

-   Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)

    -   All CCES survey data from 2012 - 2018

    -   280k respondents

-   Also use another CCES Model

    -   2010

    -   asked 133 policy questions to 1,300 people.

-   **if the question was ordered they turned it into a binary scale.**

    -   they wanted all questions to be binary.

### Findings:

-   Moderates are more attentive to elections (than liberals and conservatives)

    -   more responsive to incumbency

    -   more responsive to candidate experience

    -   more responsive to ideologies

-   Most moderates appear to be Downsian

-   results suggest centrist voters drive the relative success of incumbents, centrists, and experienced candidates.

-   Find 6.5% of CCES respondents are inattentive

    -   This is a bit weird to me... Not sure how to say it. THIS IS SURVEY RESPONDENTS!

        -   this seems to conflict with the general idea in the american voter that most voters are inattentive.

        -   Someone that chooses to fill out a survey is probably less likely to be an inattentive voter.

## [Mehlhaff, Isaac, et al. 2024. "Where Motivated Reasoning Withers and Looms Large: Fear and Partisan Reactions to the COVID-19 Pandemic," American Journal of Political Science.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12808)

### Abstract:

Contemporary American politics has been largely characterized by hyper partisanship and polarization, with partisan-motivated reasoning a thematic concern. Theories of emotions in politics suggest that anxiety might interrupt partisan heuristics and encourage citizens to reason more evenhandedly---but in what domains and to what extent? We use original panel data to assess how anxiety about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 interacted with partisan attachments to shape political judgment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The structure of our data allows us to assess large-scale implications of politically relevant emotions in ways that so far have not been possible. We find large effects on policy attitudes: Republicans who were afraid of getting sick rejected signals from copartisan leaders by supporting mask mandates and the like. Effects on vote choice for Republicans were muted in comparison, but fear's large effect on independents may have been pivotal.

### Bumper Sticker:

Fear and anxiety can influence partisanship (a little)

### Research Question:

-   Why, then, did so many Republicans prefer policies starkly different from those suggested by their leaders but so few vote against those leaders?

-   How did the anxiety of COVID-19 influence partisan politics?

### Background:

-   Partisanship influences how people see, act, and listen.

-   Anxiety can influence both information gathering and information processing.

-   The COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented opportunity to test the posited link between anxiety and interruption of partisan habits.

-   Partisans typically listen to party elites.

    -   but for many republicans during Covid-19, they disagreed with the party elites.

-   **Accuracy Driven Reasoning:** a processing style in which people exert more effort to reach correct conclusions. They "attend to relevant information more carefully," "process it more deeply," and "\[consider\] more alternatives"

### Hypothesis:

1.  Fearful individuals will be more supportive of pandemic mitigation policies such as mask mandates.

2.  Fearful individuals' accuracy motivations to be visible in the information they consult

    1.  they should seek more information, including from sources they do not habitually use.

3.  Fear to be associated with a greater likelihood of voting for Joe Biden

    1.  why Biden? - because covid-19 mitigation information was more often endorsed by Biden.

4.  Fearful Republicans should move further toward support for mitigation policies simply because their attitudes have more room to change in that direction.

### Data:

-   Qualtrics survey in April 2020

    -   w/ follow up interviews in June, September, and October.

-   Examine support for five pandemic related policies:

    -   mask mandates

    -   stay at home orders

    -   business lockdowns

    -   monitor of public spaces by police

    -   mandatory covid-19 testing

-   Then assessed the influence of anxiety on information search and knowledge about Covid-19.

-   Then evaluated how anxiety altered approval rates of Trump and the CDC.

-   Finally, wave 4 is used to examine who the respondent will vote for in the election.

### Findings:

-   Anxiety about real-world events can decouple partisans' policy positions from those of their party leaders. Once citizens enter the voting booth, however, their ability to assess accountability and mete out electoral reward or punishment remains deeply affected by partisanship even under pandemic conditions.

-   fear of getting sick with COVID-19 can lead citizens to adopt policy positions contrary to party cues.

-   the results suggest that anxiety does encourage individuals to pursue accuracy-motivated reasoning, even on a highly politicized issue

-   anxiety encourages individuals to seek out new information, to eschew habitual elite cues, and process what they learn with the goal of achieving accuracy, rather than rationalizing partisan talking points.

-   At the lowest levels of fear, respondents' vote intentions were strongly associated with their party identification.

-   Fear increases people to check different news sources.

-   As fear increased, probability to vote Trump decreases.

    -   effect is not as much as the effect of fear on policy preferences (mask mandates, etc.)

-   Independents were more affected by fear.

-   fear of severe illness did little to attenuate the effect of partisanship on vote choice.

    ![](Melhaff_fear_results_trump.png){width="468"}

### Notes:

-   I don't like the way it discusses elite cues.

    -   there were so many cues from everywhere all at once.

    -   There is also a potential lag going on between cues and individual.

-   Very similar to the Charlie Hebdo article we read in comparative.

## [Hopkins, Dan, Yphtach Lelkes and Samuel Wolken. 2024. "The Rise of and Demand for Identity-Oriented Media Coverage," American Political Science Review.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12875?af=R)

I like this one!

### Abstract:

While some assert that social identities have become more salient in American media coverage, existing evidence is largely anecdotal. An increased emphasis on social identities has important political implications, including for polarization and representation. We first document the rising salience of different social identities using natural language processing tools to analyze all tweets from 19 media outlets (2008--2021) alongside 553,078 URLs shared on Facebook. We then examine one potential mechanism: Outlets may highlight meaningful social identities---race/ethnicity, gender, religion, or partisanship---to attract readers through various social and psychological pathways. We find that identity cues are associated with increases in some forms of engagement on social media. To probe causality, we analyze 3,828 randomized headline experiments conducted via Upworthy. Headlines mentioning racial/ethnic identities generated more engagement than headlines that did not, with suggestive evidence for other identities. Identity-oriented media coverage is growing and rooted partly in audience demand.

### Bumper Sticker:

More engagement/demand with articles that include identities in headlines.

### Research Question:

1.  Have social identities become more prominent in the political information environment?

2.  Do the same stories generate more engagement when framed with identity-oriented language?

### Hypothesis:

1.  Media coverage of social identities has grown in recent decades as outlets adopt identity-oriented coverage strategies (production of identity-oriented content)

2.  On social media, news content referencing core social identities is especially likely to generate engagement (audience level reaction to content)

### Background:

-   Voters may make different voting decisions when the salience of key issues changes

    -   What explains changes in salience?

        -   A major argument says **the media.**

-   The media may be devoting more coverage to identity driven media coverage

    -   however, we don't know if that is true

        -   puzzle!

-   Mechanism of focus: **audience demand**

-   Real time data metrics and a highly fragmented and competitive media market is in part what has led to changes in media coverage.

-   Economic incentives for media companies to publish this content because it gains more engagement.

-   Theory: reliance on audience metrics has increased identity-oriented media.

-   Why do social identity coverage generate audience engagement?

    -   Social identities serve as filters in a complex information environment, helping individuals identify relevant and actionable information.

    -   social identities often serve as a foundation for coordination and collective action

    -   social identity cues help individuals understand the applicable group norms in specific contexts

### Data:

-   All tweets from 19 American media outlets (2008-2021; n = 6,235,014)

-   Media outlet URLs shared by Facebook users (2017-2020; n = 553,078)

-   News website Upworthy assigned different headlines to different people of similar stories (2013-2015)

### Results:

-   Posts with identity-related content have higher levels of expressive and social engagement (measured via liking and sharing) than those without it.

-   Different outlets are shown to invoke different identities more frequently than others.

-   Since 2007, mentions of racial and partisan identities on Twitter have roughly tripled.

-   Partisan identities appear in a large proportion of Facebook posts, and the prevalence of other identities in news URLs posted on Facebook is roughly 2--5 percentage points higher, depending on the identity category

### Notes:

-   This is an interesting article

-   I think it fits nicely with other supply/demand explanations of media

## [Chiou, Fang-Yi and Max Goplerud. 2024. "Effective Lawmaking Across Congressional Eras," Journal of Politics.](https://mgoplerud.com/papers/CG_Eras.pdf)

### Abstract:

A key concept in American legislative politics is the extent to which members are effective, i.e. have the ability to propose and advance bills on important topics in Congress. We propose a new measure of a member's legislative effectiveness that covers both chambers from 1873 to 2010 and incorporates all 1.1 million introduced bills, opening up a wide range of new opportunities for examining legislative institutions and behavior across this long historical period. To pursue this, we theorize and empirically examine how the determinants of a member's legislative effectiveness hinge on legislative institutions. While uncovering consistent results with the existing literature that has focused on the period starting in the early 1970s, we find striking differences when examining earlier periods. For instance, we find that ideological moderates have higher effectiveness relative to extremists before 1975, whereas the importance of majority-party membership increases dramatically from 1947.

### Bumper Sticker:

We made a new legislative efficiency score that tells us stuff about political history.

### Background:

-   What does it mean to be an effective lawmaker?

    -   "The proven ability to advance a member's agenda items through the legislative process and into law" (Volden & Wiseman 2014)

-   looking at structural institutions to see how it changes efficiency.

-   They are creating a new way to measure members' legislative efficiency

-   Primarily focused on role of committee chairs, majority parties, and ideological distance to chamber medians.

-   Rule changes + organizational changes separate the legislative eras.

    -   what institutional factors caused variation in efficiency.

### Hypothesis:

![Which factors the authors expect will have the most impact on legislative efficiency in different eras.](Chiou_hyp_matrix.png){fig-align="center" width="541"}

### Data:

-   Create a member-level measure of effectiveness by considering the totality of bills that are introduced into Congress within a term.

-   1873-2010

-   Create bill level measure to weigh importance of a bill.

-   1.1 million bills

-   look at bill progress + importance. - measure of bill salience.

### Results:

-   Between the 1890s and 1946, we find that ideological extremism harms a members legislative effectiveness.

-   After 1947, we find clear advantages for majority party members.

-   the effect of ideological distance on legislative effectiveness disappears from the mid 1970s, coinciding with the increasingly pronounced roles of political parties and committee chairs.

-   We also find that committee chairs tend to have higher effectiveness, with the effect being largest during the Textbook Congress in the House while staying stable in the Senate.

-   Separate 1873-2010 into four regimes:

    -   Early (1873-1888)

    -   Pre-War (1889-1946)

    -   Textbook Congress (1947-1974)

    -   Post-Reform (1975-2010)

## [Levendusky, Matt, et al. 2024. "Has the Supreme Court Become Just Another Political Branch? Public Perceptions of Court Approval and Legitimacy in a Post-Dobbs World," Science.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk9590)

### Abstract:

Have perceptions of the U.S. Supreme Court polarized, much like the rest of American politics? Because of the Court's unique role, for many years, it remained one of the few institutions respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But the Court's dramatic shift to the right in recent years---highlighted by its *Dobbs* decision in 2022---potentially upends that logic. Using both eight waves of panel data and 18 nationally representative surveys spanning two decades, we show that while there was little evidence of partisan polarization in earlier years, in 2022 and 2023, such patterns are clear in favorability, trust, legitimacy, and support for reform. Factors that used to protect the Court---like knowledge about it and support for key democratic values---no longer do so. The Court has also become more important to voters, and will likely remain a political flashpoint, with disquieting implications for the Court's place in our polity.

### Bumper Sticker:

Dobbs bad for Court

### Research Question:

Has the Supreme Court become politicized and lost legitimacy in recent years?

### Background:

-   Court needs legitimacy

-   No legitimacy = no power

    -   weakest branch

-   Reservoir of good will over time

-   However, court has lurched farther to the right and acted more politically.

-   Favorability $\neq$ Legitimacy

-   Dobbs overturns Roe v. Wade

    -   Probably the biggest decision in recent Court history.

### Data:

-   18 nationally represented surveys spanning nearly two decades

-   Panel data

-   8 wave panel dataset

### Results:

-   Court has lost legitimacy and favorability

-   Democrats see court as less legitimate and **this has persisted over time.**

-   Dobbs really messed up the courts legitimacy

-   People more informed and knowledgeable about courts have lost legitimacy

-   Increase support for court reforms.

### Notes:

-   This seems like the same article that Gibson wrote about the effect of Dobbs.

    -   Improves upon the Gibson article in three ways:

        -   panel data availability

        -   timing of panel data allows flexibility in regards to the Dobbs leak

        -   data goes into 2023 allowing study of overtime Dobbs effect rather than immediate effect.

# Week 3 - Classic Readings in American Politics

## [Campbell, Angus, Philip Converse, Warren Miller and Donald Stokes. 1960. The American Voter. Ch. 4.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a9TpKXJVtmA9b48Ptus0apuNc68GpCzL/view?usp=sharing)

### Partisan Choice - Chapter 4.

-   The motivational role of perceptions of the wider political environment deserves greater attention.

#### Bumper Sticker:

Levels of attitudes impact vote choice.

#### Main Hypothesis:

-   The voting act depends in an immediate sense on the individual voter's evaluative orientations towards *several* objects of politics ought to be tested by an examination of the influence of all these orientations at once.

#### Psychological forces on behavior:

-   Voting is the resultant of attitudinal forces.

-   voters have orientations to the elements of politics

    -   elements include the president, domestic + foreign policy, performance of parties in gov.

        -   these are evaluated and subsequently shape the orientation as either positive or negative.

            -   these combined make up a system of partisan attitudes.

#### Partisan Attitude and Voting Choice:

-   The psychological measures strongly affect the partisan vote.

-   More favorable attitude of Eisenhower = higher % of republicans voted for him

-   Less favorable attitude of Eisenhower = Lower % of republicans voted for him.

-   data is a small n.

-   Note this is just one attitude dimension that does not explain the voting act

    -   authors argue the partisan choice is based on a **system of partisan attitudes.**

-   Attitude towards Eisenhower at the extreme ends predicts vote choice pretty well. However, those that are more neutral in their attitude towards Eisenhower (regardless of party affiliation) does not predict vote choice well.

    -   Authors need more dimensions to explain vote choice as attitude toward Eisenhower is not enough.

-   These graphs are awful.

#### Findings:

-   Evidence for their hypothesis is supported from their sample

    ![Results of their model in predictive power of vote.](American_voter_finding_1.png)

-   Also looked at the error rate and why it existed.

    -   did some qualitative work through interviews

        -   "Our interviews suggest that the dynamics of these face-to-face associations are capable of generating forces that may negate the force of the individual's own evaluations of the elements of politics." p.76

            -   "...For example, one respondent traced an abrupt reversal of his vote intention to the arrival of a brother-in--law from California; another to the pressures he felt from work associates; another to face-to-face badgering by a precinct committeeman." p.76

                -   Seeing a bit of social capital/Gerber, green, Lerimer, in here

-   Also showing early signs/evidence of partisan sorting among an individuals network.

#### The Effects of Attitude Conflict:

-   Campaign is important for them as it increases political salience.

-   This section seems to ask to what degree does a campaign influence the individuals vote decision.

-   They ask when an individual's vote decision crystallized.

    -   majority knew before campaign

        -   2nd most knew after who candidate was.

    -   Those that knew earliest had the highest joint relation of those 6 attitudes tested earlier.

        -   the decision time of who to vote correlates with a decline in 6 attitudinal relationship.

            -   INTERESTING! - the people that are latest to decide have the lowest correlation in the 6 attitudes tested.

                -   might these be moderates? Might this explain why candidates start turning to the middle during the general election? Might this be why there is so much focus on the undecided voters?

-   **The proportion deciding late always is greater as the degree of attitude conflict is greater; at any attitude level.**

-   persons in the sample who decided late had the highest amount of attitudes in conflict.

-   Later voter has less enthusiasm about candidate.

    -   more likely to split ticket.

        -   "In our data from several presidential election campaigns it is clear that persons who show some degree of conflict of partisan attitude are less likely to be interested in the campaign than those whos attitudes are fully consistent, and they are less likely to care how the election turns out." p.85

            -   this seems to be different from the Fowler et. al reading from earlier.

            -   bring this up to Josh.

## [Converse, Philip. 1964. "The Nature of Belief Systems in the Mass Public," (reprinted in Critical Review, 2006).](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WdeeD7y2G36c9IBJNURf9dsPuJtMTbMw/view?usp=sharing)

### Main Focus:

Differences in the nature of belief systems held on the one hand by elite political actors and, on the other hand, by the masses that appear to be "numbered" within the spheres of influence of these belief systems.

### Hypothesis:

There are important and predictable differences in ideational worlds as we progress downward through such "belief strata" and that these differences, while obvious at one level, are easily overlooked and not infrequently miscalcualted.

1.  As one moves from elite sources of belief systems downwards on such an informational scale, several important things occur

    1.  the contextual grasp of "standard" political belief systems fades out very rapidly, almost before one has passed beyond the 10 percent of the American population that in the 1950s had completed standard college training.

        1.  The net result, as one moves downward, is that constraint declines across the universe of idea-elements, and that the range of relevant belief systems becomes narrower and narrower.

2.  Objects change as we move down as well.

    1.  From more abstract to simple/"close to home" objects.

        1.  abstract \> social groups/charismatic leaders\>objects of immediate experience (family, job, etc.)

### Definitions:

-   Belief system: a configuration of ideas and attitudes in which the elements are bound together by some form of constraint or functional interdependence.

    -   Static "constraint" - may be taken to mean the success we would have in predicting, given initial knowledge that an individual holds a specified attitude, that he holds certain further ideas and attitudes.

    -   Dynamic "constraint" - refers to the probability that a change in the perceived status of one idea-element would psychologcially require, from the point of view of the actor, some compensating change(s) in the status of idea elements elsewhere in the configuration.

    -   idea elements - make up a belief system. No formal definition but seem to be an actors preferences.

        -   idea elements vary in **centrality**.

            -   this refers to the importance of the idea element within the belief system.

                -   these can change over time. Generally thought that "ends" are supposed to be more central than "means".

    -   Belief systems have *ranges*

        -   the scope of objects that are referents for ideas and attitudes in the system.

            -   focus will be on belief systems with wide ranges and some degree of centrality.

### Sources of constraint on idea-elements:

#### Logical Sources of Constraint:

-   government revenues, government expenditures, and budget balance are three idea-elements that suggest some purely logical constraints.

    -   these positions are contradictory.

        -   however, this still does not ensure subjective constraints will be felt by the actor.

-   *hypothesis 1) logical inconsistencies would be far more prevalent in a broad public.*

-   constraints among idea-elements visible at an elite level is mirrored by the same lines of constraint in the belief system of their less visible "supporters."

    -   they believes this to be incorrect.

#### Psychological Sources of Constraint:

-   Few belief systems depend on logical constraints.

-   Logical contradictions in belief system

    -   IMPORTANTLY: elites familiar with the totality of the belief system recognize the logically constrained cluster of ideas.

-   There are like mega ideas(?), postures, values that make up prime centrality

    -   social darwinism, social change, natural law, the nature of social justice

### Social Sources of Constraint:

#### First source of social constraint:

-   In the case of the belief system, arguments are developed to lend some more positive rationale to the fact of constraint: The idea-elements go together not simply because both are in the interest of the person holding a particular status but for more abstract and quasi-logical reasons developed from a coherent world view as well. It is this type of constraint that is closest to the classic meaning of the term **"ideology."**

#### Second source of social constraint:

-   Shaping a belief system into something that is credible to large portions of the population can only be done by some minuscule portion of the population.

-   idea elements of a belief system are diffused in "packages".

    -   ("If you believe this, then you will also believe that, for it follows in such-and-such ways").

-   Information must be successfully transmitted.

-   trickling of information is largely due to differences in education

    -   but also modified by differences in specialized interest and tastes that individuals have acquired over time.

#### Active Use of Ideological Dimensions of Judgement:

-   Seems to be describing the role of information shortcuts.

-   greater constraint a system of multiple elements - the easier it can be packaged and understood.

-   Uses 'yardsticks' as the term to describe this.

-   Hierarchy of respondents:

    -   **Ideologue:** top level - people who had some abstraction conceptualization

        -   smallest group

    -   **Semi-ideologue:** second level - mentioned a dimension but did not seem to grasp fully the dimension/concepts

        -   second smallest

    -   **Group Interest** - Third level - failed to rely upon any such over-arching dimensions yet evaluated parties and candidates in terms of their expected favorable or unfavorable treatment of different social groupings in the population.

        -   Largest

            -   some variation in sophistication at this level

            -   less interest in politics.

            -   Why aren't they considered ideologues?

                -   they are kinda described as "followers"

    -   **Nature of the Times:** Fourth level - residual category - respondents that invoked some policy considerations in their evaluations yet employed none of the references meriting location in any of the first three levels.

        -   nature of the times voters

        -   Issue reference was a single narrow policy for which they felt personal gratitude or indignation toward a party or candidate. Don't connect these policies to bigger postures of the party.

    -   **No issue content:** Fifth level - respondents whose evaluations of the political scene had no shred of policy significance whatever.

        -   they can be loyal to parties but have no idea what they stand for.

        -   devoted attention to personal qualities of candidates.

### Other:

-   Early on, people could distinguish democrats as liberal because they spent and republicans as conservative because they wanted to save.

    -   "spend-save" dimension used quite a bit by the voters surveyed.

-   Groups as attitude objects are of higher centrality in masses than elites.

-   masses less stable overtime in belief system.

### Questions for lecture

-   P.11 - not entirely sure what they are talking about - a little confusing.

### Chapter 1

-   Congressmen are interested in getting reelected

    -   this is the core assumption made for analytically purposes in the book. All else is second to this main point.

-   growth of "career" congressmen.

    -   used to be lots of "volunteerism" - now this has fallen to the wayside.

-   Fenno assigns three prime goals to congressmen:

    -   getting reelected

    -   achieving influence in congress

    -   making good public policy

-   Nomination is through primary

-   American congressmen have to mobilize their own resources.

-   MP: a congressmen must build a powerbase that is substantially independent of party.

-   What can a congressmen do to affect the fortunes of a presidency?:

    -   support president in roll call votes (if same party)

-   Congressmen typically have narrow victories at some point.

-   All members share an interest in doing things to get them reelected.

    -   What are activities that are electorally useful to engage in.

        -   advertising: an effort to disseminate one's name among constituents in such a fashion as to create a favorable image but in messages having little or no issue content.

            -   good to be known. need a brand.

                -   modern version seems to be starting a podcast.

        -   Credit claiming: acting so as to generate a belief in a relevant political actor (or actors) that one is personally responsible for causing the government, or some unit thereof, to do something that the actor (or actors) consider desirable.

            -   individual accomplishment

            -   bringing home the pork.

        -   Position taking: public enunciation of a judgmental statement on anything likely to be of interest to political actors.

            -   roll call votes

            -   statements

            -   normative stuff

            -   Congressmen should stick to old positions - be "conservative"

                -   facing defeat, it may make sense to gamble on new policy positions.

### Chapter 2

-   Chapter 1 was dedicated to show what activities are electorally useful to congressmen.

    -   The goal of chapter 2 is to show what happens when members who need to engage in these activities assemble for collective action

-   Committee position can be important for reelection.

    -   productivity of the committee

    -   power of the committee

    -   division of labor

    -   The quest for specialization in congress, is a quest for credit.

-   Parties are important for reelection

    -   members of the same party do not all take the same position

        -   they have some freedom to exercise their vote.

    -   Party leaders are chosen not to be program salesman or vote mobilizers, but to be brokers, favor-doers, agenda-setting, and protectors of established institutional routines.

-   How do congressmen view their home district? What is their perception of it?

    -   concentric circles

        -   

            ![Concentric circle example](concentric.svg){width="208"}

        -   four concentric circles for each congressman:

            -   geographic

            -   reelection

            -   primary

            -   personal

### The District:

-   The largest of the concentric circle.

-   the entity to which, from which, and within which the member travels. It is the entity whose boundaries have been fixed by state legislative enactment or by court decision.

-   geographical constituency.

-   house members describe their district with political and demographic variables.

-   congressmen perception of district $\neq$ census data

-   Why should we care about the perception of congressmen of their district?

    -   it may influence how they govern.

    -   How they seek reelection

-   Congressmen all seem to think of their district on some level of homogeneity/heterogeneity.

-   The less conflict a congressman perceives among district interests, the more likely he is to see his district as homogeneous.

-   district construction are largely artificial. They do not necessarily represent or encompass real physical social communities.

-   "distance acts as a barrier to contact and to interest." p.7

### The Supporters:

-   Congressmen do think of a political community within his geographical constituency

    -   those in the district that think they will for him.

        -   reelection constituency.

    -   Starting seeing the district as "that group won't vote for me", "I do well with that group"

-   "who voted for me *last time*."

### The Primary Constituency: The Strongest Supporters:

-   Congressmen distinguish between weak and strong supporters

### The Personal Constituency: The Intimates:

-   Center of concentric circle

-   the closest people to the member

-   advisers/confidants

-   "home base"

These chapters are basically all about how the President deals with principle-agent problems.

### Chapter 1; Leader or Clerk?:

-   When we make judgments about the president, what exactly are we evaluating?

-   What is the President's influence on governmental action?

    -   His strength and weakness, then, turns on his personal capacity to influence the conduct of the men who make up the government.

-   power means influence

-   Two ways to study political power:

    -   one way: focus on tactics of influencing certain men in given situations

    -   other way: what can this man accomplish to improve the prospect that he will have influence when he wants it? What is its nature and what are its resources?

        -   what he does to boost his chance of mastery in any instance, looking toward tomorrow from today

            -   **this way is the focus of the book.**

    -   Focus: Eisenhower, Truman, FDR

-   President is an invaluable clerk. President can be used by members of congress to help themselves - his actions are useful in their business.

-   People look to the president to do something on everything

    -   however they cant.

-   the growth of the presidency represents a historical need from other parts of government.

-   Presidents constituency:

    -   Executive officialdom

    -   Congress

    -   partisans

    -   citizens at large

    -   abroad

-   **Presidential power is the power to persuade**

    -   see example with Eisenhower.

    -   not all results can be achieved through orders given by the presidency.

-   Look at three events to illustrate point:

    -   MacArthur Dismissal

    -   Steel mill strikes

    -   Little Rock School integration.

-   Seems to be discussing principle-agent issue.

-   Embedded within these three events is a host of other factors used by the president to help ensure they exert influence in their action

    -   president involvement was unambiguous

    -   so were his words

    -   order was widely publicized

    -   men receiving order had control of everything to carry out

    -   no doubt of authority

-   Favorable factors that ensure compliance more in depth:

    -   First factor: a presidential order is assurance the president has spoken.

        -   given by the man himself

    -   Second factor: Clarity about his meaning (of order)

    -   Third factor: Publicity of directive.

    -   Fourth factor: the directive is actually able to be carried out.

    -   Fifth factor: What he wants is by his right.

-   Accomplishing directives without some use of these factors will fall flat for the presidency.

-   Important to note the three events were all last resorts.

### Chapter 3; The Power to Persuade:

-   *The constitution didn't separate powers it created a government of shared power*

-   The essence of a President's persuasive task is to convince such men that what the White House wants of them is what they ought to do for their sake and on authority.

-   Fear of presidential action is important in allowing the president to have greater persuasiveness.

-   The power to persuade is the power to bargain

    -   status and authority help with bargaining.

-   President and congress need each other to do anything.

-   President still to some degree has to persuade people within the executive office.

    -   lower tier department officials.

-   logic and reasoning is not enough for persuasion

    -   reminds me of Socrates vs. the Sophists

        -   Plato, in his famous fight against the ancient Sophists, discovered that their "universal art of enchanting the mind by arguments" (Phaedrus 261) had nothing to do with truth but aimed at opinions which by their very nature are changing, and which are valid only "at the time of the agreement and as long as the agreement lasts" (Theaetetus 172). He also discovered the very insecure position of truth in the world, for from "opinions comes persuasion and not from truth" (Phaedrus 260). The most striking difference between ancient and modern sophists is that the ancients were satisfied with a passing victory of the argument at the expense of truth, whereas the moderns want a more lasting victory at the expense of reality. In other words, one destroyed the dignity of human thought whereas the others destroy the dignity of human action. The old manipulators of logic were the concern of the philosopher, whereas the modern manipulators of facts stand in the way of the historian. For history itself is destroyed, and its comprehensibility ---based upon the fact that it is enacted by men and therefore can be understood by men---is in danger, whenever facts are no longer held to be part and parcel of the past and present world, and are misused to prove this or that opinion. p.9 Origins of totalitarianism

-   "The people on the hill don't do what they might like to do, they do what they think they have to do in their own interest as they see it."

-   President has to persuade congressmen that what he wants is in the best interest of them.

## [Dahl, Robert. 1957. "Decision-Making in a Democracy: The Supreme Court as National Policy Maker," Journal of Public Law.](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/8021455/mod_resource/content/1/DahlDecisionMaking.pdf)

-   Supreme court is not solely a legal institution.

### Main focus: 

-   "What is critical is the extent to which a court can and does make policy decisions by going outside established "legal" criteria found in precedent, statute, and constitution."

-   Much of the court's legitimacy rests upon the fiction that it is not a political institution but exclusively a legal one.

-   There are cases where the supreme court is deciding between policy and the solution cannot be found in precedent, statute, or the constitution.

    -   thus the court is a national policy maker.

-   This motivates the question: "what groups benefit or are handicapped by the Court and how does the allocation by the Court of these rewards and penalties fit into our presumably democratic political system?

### II 

-   The Majority Criterion

    -   simply majority vs minority.

    -   every conflict within a given society must be a dispute between a majority of those eligible to participate and a minority or minorities; or else it must be a dispute between or among minorities only.

    -   Court has three possible outcomes:

        -   accord with the preferences of a minority of citizens and run counter to the preferences of a majority

        -   accord with the preferences of a majority and run counter to the preferences of a minority

        -   accord with the preferences of one minority and run counter to the preferences of another minority, the rest being indifferent.

    -   This role is not that important or defended much because congress is a thing and represents this all much better.

    -   But then does the court protect minorities from "tyrannical" majorities?

        -   well this is also a problematic view according to Dahl

            -   Democracy is rule by majority. The principle of majority rule is a logical necessity.

                -   for the court to act in this way is to affirm that the court *ought* to act in a way to deny popular sovereingty and political equality ought to prevail in this counry.

    -   How do we even know what the population thinks? What is the majority?

        -   pre mass polling

        -   uses congress + president as the barometer of "majority" opinion.

    -   Justices are appointed by presidents - who don't usually appoint hostile justices!

        -   policy views of the court are never far out of line with the lawmaking majorities of the United States (this is obviously a bit outdated as we see differently today).

    -   Lawmaking majorities generally have their way.

    -   The court can delay the application of policy for a long time

-   Right of Justice

    -   basic premise: a country that respects the rights of man or believes in it, the court should defend these rights against a lawmaking majority.

        -   but the justices are appointed by the lawmaking majority

            -   are their beliefs ever that far out of line with them?

                -   do we really think they would go against them?

                    -   doesn't look that good:

                        -   slave owners over slavery

                        -   white people over black people

                        -   property owners at the expense of wage earners

-   If the court flagrantly opposes the major policies of the dominant alliance

    -   legitimacy goes down.

-   Court is least effective against a current law making majority and least inclined to act.

-   Not majority or minority rule but *minorities* rule.

-   the Court operates to confer legitimacy, not simply on the particular and parochial policies of the dominant political alliance, but upon the basic patterns of behavior required for the operation of a democracy.

-   **The main objective of presidential leadership is to build a stable and dominant aggregation of minorities with a high probability of winning the presidency and one or both houses of Congress. The main task of the Court is to confer legitimacy on the fundamental policies of the successful coalition.**

    -   this is really important to me!
