## Why should we take text as data? 

-   Availability!

-   Text and language are integral components of political science.

-   This field is HOT right now. Very accessible.

-   Opens up exciting new opportunities for measurement and inference.

## What can we learn? 

-   social media data gives us real-time measures of mass and elite behavior

-   Text of floor speeches, press releases, supreme court briefs, and manifestos offer new measures of ideological scaling.

-   Webscraping repeatedly can show us how authoritarian regimes censor content and control information.

-   The language in books and magazines over time can show us how social attitudes have evolved.
