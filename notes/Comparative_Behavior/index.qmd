# Week 1: General Introductions

This week was primarily introductions from other classmates and the professor. Some discussion included expectations and what the class would look like.

# Week 2: Intro to Comparative Political Behavior

## Anderson, Christopher J. 2009. "Interaction of Structures and Voter Behavior." *OHPB* CH. 31: 589-609.

**Bumper Sticker: Rules & context influence and are influenced by behaviour!** (British spelling)

**Abstract:** This article discusses and reviews the growing literature on the nexus of macro-level structures and individual behaviour that some studies are a part of. It looks at the effects that macro-level institutions and contexts have on citizen behaviour, along with how political institutions and the environment where citizens form opinions and act, help in moderating the effects of individual-level factors on citizen behaviour. The modelling structures and behaviour, effects of structures on voter behaviour, and the interactions of structures and behaviour in research on economic voting are some of the topics covered in the article.

**Outline:**

-   **Does x cause behaviour y? It depends!**

    1.  **Example: Does institutional performance affect people's sense of whether their political system is legitimate?**
        -   **Answer: The impact of corruption on system support is conditional on whether citizens are supporters of the incumbent government.**
    2.  **Studies are getting better at using institutions and context to predict the effects of citizen behaviour.**

-   Comparative study of structures and behaviour = citizens in context 

-   Context and behaviour intimately connected by:

    1.  Formal and informal rules; people's preferences, attitudes, and behaviour affect the establishment and functioning of rules
    2.  Citizens are exposed to variable social, political, and economic environments that they are supposed to understand, interpret, and sometimes shape

-   Advances in surveys, replication, and computing have allowed for cross-national and multi-level research into behaviour

-   1980s and 1990s renewed focus on institutional questions across polysci that could be tested, as well as interest in developing contextual theories of political behaviour

-   Comparative study of behaviour politics has investigated macro-level contexts/structures:

    1.  Institutions

    2.  Structural conditions

-   Interaction between structures and behaviour presumes several things:

    1.  Politics is about the interaction of people's values and the rules and conditions that govern the implementation of those values
    2.  The rules and realities in which citizens make choices are themselves a function of people's values
        -   "Put another way: contexts are critical for understanding the decisions people make because they affect different people differently, and people's decisions, in turn, shape the nature, shape, and stability of these contexts" (678).

-   Common approach assumes that context shapes behaviour; assumes behaviour to be DV and that it is exogenous and stable

    1.  Do institutions have direct effects on behaviour?

        -   Voting example: structures can affect voters directly, indirectly, and interactively (or contingently)
            -   Direct: rational choice theory; individuals weigh costs and benefits of voting and act accordingly
            -   Indirect: behaviours of elites within electoral rules empower or constrain citizen choices; structures have consequences but these consequences have secondary (or indirect) effects on behaviour
            -   Contingent: effect of some structural feature strengthened or weakened, depending on presence of some 3rd variable; the turnout gap between individuals with many and few resources is particularly pronounced in countries where the cost of voting is high

-   Recent studies have looked at how the nature of a country's representative structures interacts with the willingness of voters to punish governments for bad economic performance
    1.  Bad economy impact hinges on ability of voters to hold gov't responsible
    2.  Institutions can hamper this ability of voters to reward or punish gov'ts
    3.  Clarity of responsibility also varies over time within (and across) countries b/c of election outcomes that change bargaining power and reshape context
    4.  Also contingent upon credible alternatives for voters to vote into office
-   Interactions of vote choice and structures in research on legitimacy
    1.  What role do institutions play in moderating sense of loss or victory citizens feel?

        -   Institutions shape the responses of winners and losers; citizen attitudes toward democratic institutions shaped by country's political context
-   "At the end of the day, what is particularly noteworthy about cross-level investigations of behavioural politics is that they hold the promise of producing a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of political life by connected hitherto unconnected streams of scholarship in the areas of institutions, political economy, policy, and behaviour and allowing us a better and more complex empirical and theoretical handle on the hows and whys of citizen politics" (690).

## Lipset, Seymour Martin. 1959. "Democracy and Working-Class Authoritarianism." *American Sociological Review* 24(4): 482-501.

### Dependent Variable: Support for democracy 

### Independent Variable: Authoritarian predisposition of the lower strata 

**ANTECEDENT FACTORS OF IV**: Lower strata lack "sophistication" and suffer economic and  psychological insecurities (intervening variables). 

### KEY TERMS:

authoritarianism, democracy, strata, liberalism (political and economic),  conservatism, communism, socialism 

### **PUZZLE**:

The intellectual left has a hard time reconciling the normative position of a  "proletarian" revolution as a necessary progressive force and the evidence of a "totalitarian degeneration of Communism" (quoting "The Choice of Comrades,"Encounter, 3 (December 1954), p. 25. Arnold A. Rogow, cited p.482).  

### KEY ARGUMENT:

Following evidence and psychological research on personality traits of  different society's strata, Lipset posits that the lower strata are predisposed to support  authoritarianism due to a lack of "sophistication" and facing economic and psychological  insecurity. The lower class will support economic liberalism but not political liberalism, while the  middle and upper class will support political liberalism. Hence, according to Lipset, there is a  natural link between the lower-class attitudes and their support of Communism. 

-Pre-1914: working-class supported both economic and political liberalism 

-Post-1914: "The intransigent, intolerant, and demonological aspects of Communist ideology attract members from the lower class of low-income, low-status occupations, and little education" (483).

### DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND STRATIFICATION:

• "Leftism/economic liberalism associated with socio-economic status" (485). • "Psychologically oriented investigators have studied the social correlates of authoritarian  personality structures as measured by the now famous F scale"(Adorno, 1950, cited p.  486). 

• Even in conservatism, economic status predicts tolerance levels (see Eysenck, 1956 and  Stouffer, 1955, cited p.486)

### AUTHORITARIAN RELIGION AND STRATIFICATION:

• Fundamentalist and chiliastic/millennial religious tradition as a predisposition for drastic  and rapid measures demanding authoritarian order. 

• The appeal of fundamentalism to the lower class acts as a pressure valve in a utopian world  where the upper class no longer dominates. 

• See Engels and his take on evangelism (488). 

### TYPICAL SOCIAL SITUATION OF LOWER-CLASS PERSON

-   "There is consistent evidence that degree of formal education, itself closely correlated with  social and economic status, is also highly correlated with undemocratic attitudes" (489). • Education predicts attitudes better than occupation (Morris Janowitz and Dwaine Marvick study, cited pp.489-490). 

-   Principal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  "sophistication," economic security, and psychological security -\> mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = "surviving"  

### THE PERSPECTIVES OF LOWER-CLASS GROUPS

-   Principal factors predisposing the lower class to authoritarian attitude are a lack of  "sophistication," economic security, and psychological security -\> mental shortcuts and  need of immediacy = "surviving"

-   Incapacity of mental abstraction and fixed mental context

### **EXTREMISM AS A COMPLEX ALTERNATIVE: A TEST OF HYPOTHESIS**

-   When the Communist Party is small and weak, it tends to uphold non-economic  liberalism/democratic values because of the **presence of intellectual leadership**. 

-   When the Communist Party (or Socialist in some cases) is a mass party, it tends to be more  authoritarian (or less committed to democratic values) because it has **stripped its  intellectual leadership**.

-   Underdeveloped countries/economies exacerbate the problems of the lower class and  increase the predisposition to authoritarianism on a like-for-like basis. 

-   This argument is evaluated subnationally and supports the urban/rural predisposition to  uphold democratic values and political liberalism.

**HISTORICAL PATTERNS AND DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS**

-   Historically, the left has been responsible for democratization; intellectual leadership still  supports democratic values, but the masses of the lower strata do not understand the  implications of the left beyond economic value to them. 

-   Conservatism is vulnerable in democracy for demographic reasons (500). • Neither conservatism nor the authoritarian predisposition of the lower class should be seen  as a threat to democracy. 

-   Educational attainment is an essential "Social Requisites of Democracy" (Lipset, 1959).

### Chapter 1: Returning to the Social Logic of Political Behavior

### Bumper Sticker:

"Despite a period of deviation from theory, social logic is important for studying political choice." 

### Summary: 

This chapter offers an intellectual history of the critical texts that defined the research orientation of political behavior. Is focuses on how traditional theories from sociology and psychology informed our understanding of political behaviors through interactions with primary groups. However, along the way, the political science discipline that studied behavior began undergoing changes to the way behavioral study was approached - emphasizing, instead, individual level survey research and a reconceptualization of social logic. Fortunately, social logic is back on the mend. 

### Research Question/Purpose: 

The purpose of this chapter is to outline the reasons for which those who study political choice and behavior should return to the social logic of the original behavioral revolution in political science. 

### Data/Methods: 

There is no data used. Passages, statements, and long quotations stand in for the data. Draws on authors such as Campbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes, Verba Findings: 

We need to return to our roots an incorporate social logic back into behavioral political science 

Interpersonal relationships can both prevent **and** facilitate change 

Many scholars broke away from social logic, pursuing instead individual level analysis from surveys and redefining social logic to fit their particular needs Newer research is returning to social logic

### Definitions: 

**Social Logic of Politics:**

a theory of politics that emphasizes the ways in which social factors (social identities, distribution of power across groups, public opinion) influence individual behaviors and how those interact with institutional structures to effect the political process. 

### Discussion Questions: 

What are the consequences of the social logic of politics for our understanding of those communities/persons with intersectional identities? Is this theory anglo centric, or does it retain its superior qualities across groups? 

How might association through primary groups have an impact of institutions? At what point does the saliency of group association diminish? Do our politics/attitudes change drastically with each primary group we grow closer to, or do those groups we first develop our attitudes through matter most? 

### Additional Notes: 

### Intro: 

The immediate social circumstances of people's lives influence what they believe and do about politics 

Immediate social circles are powerful forces in swaying ones political beliefs and actions 

Group relationships are important for fixing and maintaining opinions in relation to large parts of the political system (such as parties) (Key, 1961) 

### Sources in Sociology: 

particularly influential were Lazarsfeld, Katz, Berelson, Gaudet, and McPhee Electoral Sociology was where the onset of the behavioral revolution in political science first observed electoral choice 

Voting is a reflection of our behavior - of our conversations with other people and the attitudes we shape through those interactions 

By this logic, we vote based on how the relationships we have shape us This is counter to theories of voting as a rational act 

### Sources in Social Psychology 

particularly influential were Kurt Lewin and Leon Festinger 

helped explain conformity

sharing an identity (social class, ethnicity, religion, etc.) does NOT define a social group 

opinions, preferences, and beliefs are a joint function of how "real" the matter is, the views held by the members of a person's groups, and the persons own conceptions joining a group tends to produce changes in opinions and attitudes toward alignment with the group 

### The Turn Away from the Social Logic of Politics 

#### Started to examine individuals instead of groups 

Began surveying a lot (members of the same social circles shouldn't be surveyed together \-- its no longer as-if random, and you introduce bias into your survey responses) 

Turned social groups into objects of individual identification 

Electoral research shifted towards understanding party identification and perceptions of candidates 

#### What factors explain this shift away from the social logic? 

One set derives from decision to use national sample surveys as the exclusive source of empirical evidence of behavior 

Another set derives from theory issues \-- PoliSci insisted that sociologists couldn't explain electoral decisions or outcomes \-- opted instead for immediate determinants of vote choice: attitudes and calculations 

Statistics professors, rearing political sciences, conveyed cherished assumptions of independent sampling \-- which makes it nearly impossible to capture the psychology of inter-dependance 

#### Recognizing that data problems inhibited their ability to follow theoretical preferences 

Campbell, Converse, Miller, Stokes altered the definition of the social group and conceptualized it according to a personal perceptions regarding a reference object - taking it far away from its original intent/definition from Lewis Many others would make even larger breaks, such as Key and Downs (immediate circle provides no more than time-saving sources of information to calculating citizens) 

### Returning (Again) to the Social Logic of Politics 

We returned! 

Michigan survey responses can be used to study the role of immediate social structures on political choice and behavior 

Ton of other research is starting to do the same thing

# Week 3: Political Beliefs/Political Decision-Making

## Converse, Philip E. 2006 \[1964\]. "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics." Critical  Review: A Journal of Politics and Society 18(1): 1-74

### Normative question: 

**Does the citizenry have the "capacity" to participate in democracy**? Concern the age-old  question of the demos' potential to access information and process it in a way that would be  individually coherent in election expressions. Converse's (1964) "The Nature of Belief Systems  in Mass Publics" marks a turning point since **it can quantitatively/statistically demonstrate**

democracy defenders' worst fears: the mass public competence for a normative functioning of  democracy is blight. This question has also been approached with similar results by Lipmann (1922), "Public Opinion" and Schumpeter (1950), "Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy" (see  also Bennett, 2006, "Democratic Competence, Before Converse and After"). 

### Bumper Sticker:

Mass Public: Ideologically Innocent  

### DV:

Degree of Belief System Coherence (Individual) (a continuum)

### IV:

Level of Constrained Idea-Elements (a continuum)

### Data:

Converse stipulates that the degree of coherence of the mass public belief system is contingent on the level of constraints of the idea-elements populating a belief system: the more constrained, the  more coherent. This, in turn, predicts a degree of capacity to participate in democracy according  to one's self-assessed ideological placement. Idea-elements are mainly constrained by the  transmission of information and its digestibility. For this reason, Converse finds that 15% of the  population is deemed ideologue or near-ideologue (possessing a coherent belief system = elite political actors). In contrast, the remaining 85% (the masses) float between having a particular  interest (issue public) or having no idea. **If ideology is not driving most of the public's opinion  incentive, what is?** Converse suggests that "visible" social groupings serve as a stable heuristic  informing public opinion: party ID (.70) has more bearing than policies, but policies concerning  visible groups (school desegregation .45) have more bearing than regular policies (government and housing .28). This "ideology by proxy" might produce idiosyncratic outcomes as well: the  working man associating with Socialists against the rich but against government reigning of private  enterprise's provision of public goods.

Acquiring and processing information is contingent on **education**. Education is more prevalent in  higher strata of society (Lipset, 1959, "Social Requisite of Democracy").

### Interesting proposition: "The net result of these circumstances is that the elites of the leftist parties enjoy a"natural" numerical superiority, yet they are cursed with a clientele that is less dependable or solid in its support. The rightist elite has a natural clientele that is more limited but more dependable."

### Bumper Sticker:

Social networks allow us to rethink and re-conceptualize the role of groups in mass politics and public opinion.

### Abstract

This article presents a survey and interpretation of the contributions made by #network #theories on the study of citizens and democratic policies. The article serves as an overview of the topic. It begins by locating the network research within the rich substantive and theoretical tradition of individually and #group-based studies of #electoral #politics and #public #opinion . It addresses some methodological issues in the study of political information #networks. The article ends with the discussion of theoretical and substantive insights that were generated in several studies, such as the study of communication and persuasion among citizens.

### Research Question:

What is network analysis? What are the theoretical and substantive insights that we can derive from it, particularly regarding the study of communication and persuasion among citizens? What are some of the methodological issues of network analysis?

### Summary/Theory/Argument:

The author sets out to analyze the contribution of network theories, which have provided us the ability to analyze citizen and democratic politics from across the micro-macro spectrum. Network theories draw on the importance of groups, communities, and political information networks among and between individuals (Downs 1957) while incorporating a conceptual apparatus that extends far past the traditional notions of primary groups, organizations, and societal groups in order to define the relationships that exist among individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Despite its advantages, there are still some methodological issues with network analysis.

### Data/Methods:

It is a literature review so no real data/methods.

### Findings:

#### What is network analysis and how does it fit into the existing literature on the study of individuals and groups?

-   Network studies can be seen as a particular species within a larger genus---as one type of a contextual analysis of politics (Knoke 1990)
-   networks are formed at the complex intersection between individual preference, individual engagement, and individual location within particular contexts.
-   Eulau (1986) and Przeworski and Teune (1970) define contextual factors in terms of the aggregation of individual characteristics that affect individuals through processes of social interaction.
    -   Network Studies diverge from contextual studies in their effort to incorporate a direct mapping for the particular patterns of recurrent interaction among actors.
-   Individual level and aggregate level analysis both suffer from the same problem: they ignore the implications that arise due to patterns of individual interdependence located in time, place, and setting.

#### What are some of the methodological issues of the study of political information networks?

-   Absent direct measures on patterns of communication, neither the individual measures nor their associated aggregate versions directly address the specifics of communication and persuasion among the individuals who make up the aggregates.

-   Network studies are particularly useful in analyzing well defined populations - such as clergies, political elites, court, and legislatures.

    -   an unfortunate limitation of egocentric networks is the failure to embed dyads within larger networks and in the context of all other dyads in that same network.

    -   However, they aren't straightforward when analyzing large populations - which is the primary object of study for scholars concerned with studies of mass behavior (egocentric network survey questions and snowball surveys can help address this; pg. 5-6)

-   Political communication networks are created at the intersection of individual choice (demand) and environmental supply (which is stochastic).

#### What are the substantive and theoretical insights generated by it?

-   People are more inclined to discuss politics with others who share similar political beliefs

-   Studies ALSO demonstrate that patterns of both agreement and disagreement can be profitably understood within complex processes of communication and persuasion

    -   This means that there is persistent heterogeneity of opinions in less-dense (larger) social networks people aren't as afraid of disagreement as we initially thought

-   Political heterogeneity in the form of cross cutting cleavages can depress political participation BUT increased levels of tolerance (which might be good?)

-   Political communication networks are more important in less developed democracy, where parties are less institutionalize and politics is more volatile

-   Diversity of group discussion decreases the susceptibility of individuals to issue framing by elites

-   Network studies of political communication and persuasion provide a theoretical, analytical response to the human limitations of the citizen in democratic politics.

    -   this is important because it to do with the cognitive limitations of individuals in being self-contained, fully informed, independent maximizers

    -   particularly useful is social capital - which allows people to rely on one another for accurate information

-   political interdependence among citizens helps to explain why public opinion in the aggregate is more sophisticated than the opinions held by the average citizen - its more fully informed

-   solutions to collective action problems can be seen as occurring within networks of relationships among strategic actors who use the information they acquire through repeated interactions to facilitate group efforts

### Bumper Sticker:

Threat + conservative *OR* liberal ideology = increased authoritarian preference

### Summary:

The literature shows an interaction between threat and public preference for authoritarianism. There are two lines of literature that provide contradictory findings:

-   One argues that threat increases authoritarian preferences among those that are more prone to authoritarianism

-   Another argues that threat is associated with a switch in ideology among those who are normally non-authoritarian Using a two-wave panel study of the French population taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris, the authors find that the two occur simultaneously.

### Research Question:

What best explains the relationship between individual perceptions of threat and increased preferences for authoritarian policy?

Is the increase in support for authoritarian policies following a terrorist attack the result of:

1.  conservative and authoritarian prone individuals just more strongly manifesting their disposition in response to threat

2.  **OR** increases in ideological "switching" to support authoritarian policies in light of threatening events?

### Theory/Argument:

The authors argue that the endorsement of authoritarian policies can be explained by the theory of affective intelligence. When people experience anxiety due to novel circumstances, such as that induced by terrorist attacks, they will abandon their habitual political attachments and attend to the circumstance in a risk-averse and conservative manner.

-   **H1:** increased anger will enhance decision making based on past dispositional convictions, leading to increased polarization between left and right wing individuals (strengthen authoritarian tendencies for right-wing and weaken those same tendencies for the right)

-   **H2:** increased anxiety will initiate decision-making that is less reliant on extant convictions and hence make those on the left end of the left-right scale more attentive and responsive to calls from the right to adopt authoritarian policies.

### Data/Methods:

-   Two-wave panel taken before and after the January 2015 twin attacks in Paris

-   Data retrieved from the CEVIPOF barometer of political confidence

    -   survey was conducted using a representative sample containing 1,524 respondents in two waves

-   Construct two OLS models

    -   one measures attitude change as a function of demographic variables, ideology, as well as anxiety and anger

    -   second model includes two interaction terms that assess fear and anger with the left-right scale respectively with the expectation that the effect of fear and anger on authoritarian policies with be conditional on prior ideological conviction

Model 1:

$$
Attiude_{t2}=fear_{t2}+anger_{t2}+left/right\: scale_{t1}+attitude_{t1}+demographics_{t1}
$$

Model 2:

$$
\begin{align}Attitude_{t2} &= fear_{t2} + anger_{t2} + left/right\: scale_{t1} \\&+ fear_{t2} * left/right\: scale_1 + anger_{t2} * left/right\: scale + attitude_{t1} + demographics_{t1}\end{align}
$$

### Dependent Variable:

-   support for authoritarian policies

-   a scale consisting of all available items in the study that measure adoption or rejection of authoritarian politic preferences

    -   each item (survey question) was measured using 4-point response option (higher values = support for authoritarian policies)

    -   only one factor possessed an eigenvalue over 1

### Independent Variable:

-   emotional reaction to the terrorist attacks

### Findings:

-   Threat increases authoritarian preferences among those who are more prone to authoritarianism AND those with non-authoritarian ideology

-   Overall, people who felt fear following the attack were more likely to have switched their opinion in an authoritarian direction

-   Left-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful after the attack were more likely to change in the direction of endorsing authoritarian policies

-   Right-wing citizens who felt predominantly fearful did not experience a change in direction of endorsing authoritarian policies

-   Right-wing citizens who gelt predominantly angry following the attack experienced heightened endorsement of authoritarianism

-   Left-wing citizen on the far-left who felt predominantly angry were the least likely to support authoritarian politics following the attacks (see figure 3) but is not statistically significant

-   **H2** is supported by the first OLS model

-   **H1** is not supported UNTIL the conditional model

### Importance/Contribution:

-   contributes to our understanding of individual level variation in the endorsement of authoritarian policies as well as our understanding of attitudinal polarization (why fear might reduce polarization across a public)

-   important because the psychological mechanisms that account for the public's reaction to terrorist attacks is key to understanding enhanced support for the restriction of civil liberties

-   also advances and systematizes the literature of emotions and politics by assessing the impact of anxiety and anger on the formation of political attitudes

-   takes advantage of REAL threat perceptions, instead of experimentally manipulated ones

-   has external validity (uses a representative sample of the French population)

-   challenges conventional wisdom that emotions are irrational, turbulent states that hinder reasoning - affect activates political reasoning

### Definitions/Concepts:

#### Theories of Affective Intelligence

-   provides a framework for understanding the interplay of fear and anger with ideological convictions

-   with respect to anxiety, the theory holds that when citizens find themselves in novel circumstances, they tend to break from habitual political attachments (ideology/partisanship) and actively try to attend to contemporary circumstances about their environment.

-   with respect to anger, the theory holds that it may trigger authoritarian policy preferences through the activation of habitually learned routines, activating conservative or authoritarian attitudes among individuals who already hold a right-wing disposition.

    -   it is not the potency of threat the increases anger, but rather the degree of normative violation

#### Terror Management Theory (TMT)

-   people feel threatened by their own death and therefore adopt worldviews that allow them to find meaning and worth in their lives.

    -   awareness of ones death can cause anxiety

    -   is used to explain that mortality-related threat reinforces extant political beliefs regardless of whether these are liberal or conservative.

    -   political ideology serves as a protective shield against death anxiety.

#### Left-Right Ideological Identification

-   defined by the authors as the an organized cluster of political values that make some individuals more inclined to support some political ideas than others.

#### Threat

-   defined by the authors as an exogenous event that poses harmful consequences for the individual or her environment and evokes negative emotional reactions.

#### Anxiety

-   elevated in threatening circumstances and is one of the prime emotional reactions to a terrorist event when heightened, conveys a perception of increased risk and prompts individuals to adopt risk-averse behavior to eliminate or avert the threat

#### Anger

-   generated when people are obstructed from reaching a valued goal by an external agent whose conduct is deemed unfair and in cases when a threatening stimulus is perceived

#### Threat Stimulus

-   Assessed on two distinct grounds:

    -   is the event novel? (+anxiety)

    -   is the event a normative violation by a familiar enemy (+anger)

## Schwartz, Shalom H., et al. 2014. "Basic Personal Values Underlie and Give Coherence to Political Values: A

Cross-National Study in 15 Countries." Political Behavior 36(4): 899-930.

### Bumper Sticker:

Personal values explain political values!

### Independent Variable:

Basic Personal Values

### Dependent Variable:

Political Values

Research question: Do political attitudes and values of the general public form a coherent system? If so, what accounts for this structure and gives political values their coherence?

-   Political values = political expressions of more basic personal values

-   Basic personal values = security, achievement, benevolence, hedonism; organized on a circular continuum that reflects conflicting/compatible motivations

### Data: data from 15 countries using 8 core political values and 10 basic personal values

-   Adults eligible to vote in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Greece, Finland, Israel, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and UUS

-   Except in Australia, UK, Germany, & Turkey, respondents recruited by university students and completed self-report questionnaire individually

### Methods:

-   use basic personal values to predict expected political values; different hypotheses for 12 non-communist and 3 post-communist countries

-   Data gathered in local language of each country

-   Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) measure of 40 short verbal "portraits" of different people matched to respondents' gender, each describing a person's goals, aspirations, or wishes

    -   3-6 items measure each value

    -   For each portrait, respondents indicate how similar the person is to themselves from "not like me at all" --1 to "very much like me" --6

    -   Multimethod-multitrait analyses of the 10 values measured with PVQ and with the Schwartz Value Survey

### Findings:

-   correlation and regression analyses support almost all hypotheses

-   Basic values account for substantially more variance in political values than age, gender, education, and income

-   Multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrate graphically how circular motivational continuum of basic personal values structures relations among core political values

-   This study strengthens assumption that individual differences in basic personal values play a critical role in political thought (seems kinda obvious).

NEED TO INSERT FIGURES/PHOTOS!

## Taber, Charles S., and Milton Lodge. 2006. "Motivated Skepticism in Evaluation of Political Beliefs." *American Journal of Political Science* 50(3): 755-769.

### Bumper Sticker:

People process information through prior bias and double down in the face of new information, resulting in attitude polarization about different issues

prior attitudes + bias for confirming evidence + skepticism of opposing evidence = attitude polarization

### Research Question:

How do political beliefs evolve?

What explains political polarization in the face of factual information?

### Summary of Theory/Argument:

The authors postulate what they call a theory of affect-driven motivated reasoning in trying to explain when and why citizens actively process biased information. This theory suggests that people will anchor their evaluation of new information in their own biases - being non-skeptical of information that confirms their biases and being "motivated- skepticals" when engaging in information that is counter to their biases - i.e. spending more time trying to discredit new information. The authors propose a process of "partisan processing" that results in attitude-polarization and which is conditional on the strength of ones prior attitudes and the level of one political sophistication. They test the mechanism as a series of hypothesis that assume the following form:

**H1:** there is a prior attitude effect whereby people who feel strongly about an issue - even when encouraged to be objective and leave their preferences aside - will evaluate supportive arguments as stronger and more compelling than arguments that oppose their prior beliefs

**H2:** there is a disconfirmation bias, such that people will spend more time and cognitive resources counter-arguing opposing arguments

**H3:** there is a confirmation bias, such that when free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming arguments over disconfirming ones

**These combined will results in:**

**H4:** attitude polarization, where attitudes will become MORE EXTREME, even when people have been exposed to a balanced set of pro and con arguments

**Which is conditional upon:**

**H5:** the level of attitude strength effect, such that citizens voicing the strongest policy attitudes will be the most prone to motivated skepticism

**H6:** and the degree of political sophistication effect, such that the politically knowledgeable will be more susceptible to motivated bias than will unsophisticates.

### Data/Methods:

-   Two experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control

-   The participants (Ps) were recruited from introductory political science courses at Stony Brook University

-   Study 1: N=126

-   Study 2: N=136

-   **First Part:** Confirmation Bias

-   The participants (Ps) were seated at computers and their political attitudes were assessed through the evaluation of a series of contemporary political issues aimed at activating their priors - this was done through random assignment into either condition 1 or condition 2 (see figure 1)

-   They rated the items on a series of scales to assess attitude strength (0-100) and attitude position (like-dislike; 9 item scale)

-   They then viewed information on an information board, where they could seek out hidden policy arguments by known source alone (see figure 2); the amount of time they spend engaging in each argument was recorded by the software.

-   They viewed eight arguments without a time limit, but could only view each argument ONCE

-   They then completed the same attitude battery from the beginning of the experiment before filing out demographic information and a political knowledge scale ( to assess sophistication)

-   **Second Part:** Disconfirmation Bias

-   administered the battery again, but with the conditions (issues) swapped.

-   then asked to rank the strength of 8 arguments (4 pro and 4 con)

-   then there was a post test battery AGAIN and a recognition memory test

-   they were also asked to list their thoughts regarding two pro and two con arguments they were presented with Arguments were taken from online sources and edited such that they were similar in complexity and length.

### Findings:

-   strong evidence of a prior attitude effect (H1) such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments.

-   Participants counter-argued the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias (H2) - this was supported by the participants spending MORE time on the policy arguments that they disagreed with

-   Also find a confirmation bias (H3)---the seeking out of confirmatory evidence---when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read - this was supported by the participants seeking out information in the matrix that they agreed with

-   Both the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization (H4) ---the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes---especially among those with the strongest priors (H5) and highest levels of political sophistication (H6).

### Abstract:

### Bumper Sticker

### Model

## Bankert, Alexa, Leonie Huddy, and Martin Rosema. 2017. "Measuring Partisanship as a Social Identity in Multi-Party Systems." Political Behavior 39(1): 103-132.

### Bumper Sticker:

"multi-item scales of partisanship can work in and across multi-party systems"

### Research Question:

How (if at all) can we create a multi-item scale that measures partisanship across multi-party systems?

### Summary/Theory/Argument:

Most national election studies tend to rely on a single measure of partisanship. Such measurements tend to vary in terms of how they are phrased on surveys and also struggle to capture the range of partisan identity, typically at the low and high ends of the spectrum. The authors believe that they can develop a multi-item scale of partisan identity that better predicts political behavior ACROSS various multiparty democracies than the traditional single item scales common on surveys. 

### Data/Methods:

#### Partisan Identity Scale

Creates an Eight-Item Scale of Partisanship that is derived from Social Identity Theory Derives three (3) hypothesis to test whether the scale is better than traditional models: **H1**: The Partisan Identity Scale should differentiate equally well among low, middling, and high levels of identity to best uncover the link between identity and political activity across its full range. Expect each scale item to provide more complete information about partisan strength than the traditional single party identification item. 

In terms of the IRT analysis, this means that each item's information function will be more peaked and contain greater information than the standard single measure of partisan strength. In the three European multi-party systems under study, we expect both lower and higher levels of partisan intensity to remain less well detected when measured with the traditional item

**H2:** the partisan identity scale to exhibit all three types of invariance, which means that the fit of the metric invariance model will be no worse than the fit of the configural model, and that the fit of the scalar model will be no worse than that of the metric model. 

**H3:** The partisan identity scale should more powerfully predict in-party voting and political engagement than the traditional party identification item. We also expect the partisan identity scale to better predict political behavior than a multi-item indicator of ideological intensity 

### Data:

Uses Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K. as the three countries with which to derive and apply the scale.

#### Netherlands:

2012 Dutch Parliamentary elections among members of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The LISS contains 5000 households, entailing 8000 individuals Data are drawn from three time points: August 2012 (''Elections 2012''), after the national election in September 2012 (''Dutch Parliamentary Election Study''), and again as part of a module in December 2012/January 2013 (''Politics and Values: Wave 6'').

#### Sweden:

Swedish data were drawn from the Swedish Citizen Panel, a largely opt-in online panel run by the Laboratory of Opinion Research (LORE) at the University of Gothenburg. 

Utilize data from Panel 8 (11/14/13--12/18/13) and add-on Panel 8-2 (12/10/13--1/7/14). 16,130 panelists were invited to take the Panel 8 survey and 9279 completed it for a completion rate of 64 %. 

2000 panelists were invited to complete Panel 8-2 of which 1496 answered the survey. All panelists in Panel 8.2 and a randomly selected 2000 panelists in Citizen Panel 8 received the identity model. 

Our analytic sample is confined to those in Panel 8 and Panel 8-2 who completed the identity items (N = 2464). 

#### UK:

Data for the U.K were taken from the 2015 British Election Study (BES), an online panel study conducted by YouGov. 

draw on data from pre-election wave 3 of the BES, conducted between September 19, 2014 and October 17, 2014 and pre- election wave 4, conducted in March 2015. 

In total, 27,839 respondents participated in wave 3 and 6141 were randomly assigned and 5954 completed a module that included the partisan identity items. 

In wave 4, 16,629 respondents participated and 3500 of them completed the partisan identity module.

### Measures:

Partisanship Strength by Country vs. Partisan Identity Strength (the 8 Item Scale that is also known as the Partisan Identity Scale) 

### Methods:

the methods are pretty complex, but essentially each hypothesis undergoes a different set of tests/inquiry. \
**H1** - figure 1 shows how the 8 item scale that the authors derived is better measure of latent partisan strength than the individual measures in each country. This is also event in the peaks that you can see in each figure. They are more much more sensitive to to the full range of the low- high spectrum. **H2** - invariance is measured using R software to perform multi-group confirmatory analysis (CFA) Configural invariance is a good fit 

The partisan scale has the same metric across countries 

Its also scalar across countries 

**H3** - analyse the determinants of in-party voting using a logistic regression model 

Partisan identity strength has a sizeable influence on in-party voting and its effects exceed that of partisanship strength. 

Partisan identity predicted in- party vote and participation while holding partisan strength constant

### Findings:

Levels of partisanship have decreased in Europe in recent decades. 

The eight-item partisan identification scale: 

-   provides greater information about partisan intensity than the standard single-item

-   possess the same measurement across all three countries 

-   better predicts in-party voting and political participation than ideological intensity measures

### Bumper Sticker:

\*Value conflict can explain why partisanship assumes both a steady AND changeable nature

### Research Question:

The paradox of partisanship: Why is partisan identification stable for some people and not stable for others?

### Summary/Theory/Argument:

Keele and Wolak seek to explain why some people are more prone to #partisan "instability" (or "volatility") than others. To the authors, the reason for this has to do with the "hierarchy of values". When people have obvious values that rank higher than others (humanitarianism, egalitarianism, equality) AND these #values align with political elites values, then partisan identity remains a steady tool with which to measure the political world against. HOWEVER, for some people, the values rank similarly and therefore cause conflicting #preferences that individuals struggle to resolve. Competing values will produce #volatility in partisan opinions specifically when individuals endorse values that cross the fault lines of partisan dialogue 

### Data/Methods:

**Data:** ANES data from 1992, 1994, and 1996

**Model:** Estimates several heteroskedastic regression models as well as ordered probit models The heteroskedastic regression models are used because they expect differences in the response variance of party identification survey items to reflect value-conflict 

this is because citizens with ideologically inconsistent value structures will struggle to identify with one party or another 

there should be unequal variance across observations (which is heteroskedastic) 

this heteroskedasticity is modeled to see if those who experience value conflict reveal less predictable responses to party identification survey items than those who do 

### Independent Variable:

Value conflict 

is measured using **4 core values** in American Politics: 

Egalitarianism, limited government, moral traditionalism, and humanitarianism 

The measures for these values are derived from a set of ANES survey questions on each value

1992 and 1996 are the years they were taken from (1992 is missing humanitarianism)

### Dependent Variable:

Partisan Instability 

Two "manifestations" 

-   predictability of survey response (those experience value conflict should have less predictable responses to partisan questions) to two survey questions: 

    -   seven-point party identification scale and ideological self identification scale 

-   change in party identification over time (this one is tested using the 1994 and 1996 panel data) 

### Findings:

1992 and 1996 elections reveal value-driven volatility in partisan identification 

-   Instabilities in political views reflect either: 

    -   low information (for some) 

    -   trade-offs of the political world that cause conflict of values 

Value conflict will disrupt partisan stability when an individuals value organization is non-ideological - i.e. it doesn't quite fit the rhetoric or portrayal by the liberal vs. conservative, left-right spectrum. what makes it non-ideological is that you support values on BOTH sides 

Those that have values the match political elites leads to stable partisanship 

Those that have internalized value organization that doesn't match elites leads to conflicts of values and partisan volatility. 

Elites identify and interpret core values to justify their policy positions 

Values and ideology are traditionally distinct concepts - but values can be distributed along an ideological spectrum

## Hatemi, Peter K., et al. 2008. "Is there a 'Party' in Your Genes?" Political Research Quarterly 62(3): 584-600.

### Bumper Sticker:

Genes don't choose party, but they influence intensity!

### **Independent Variable:**

Twins! MZ and DZ and familial party ID and intensity

### Dependent Variable:

party identification and party intensity

### Research question:

Do your genes determine political party identification?

### Hypothesis:

-   Party identification (PID) is primarily the result of familial socialization and not other latent social or genetic influences.

-   Partisan intensity is influenced by genes as well as the environment.

### Data:

-   Data collected in mid- to late 1980s as part of Virginia 30,000 Health and Life-Style Survey for Twins (VA30K)

### Methods:

-   Polychoric correlations by twin pair zygosity calculated for each of the traits.

-   Correlations between PID, partisan intensity, sociodemographic items, selected personality traits, and political attitudes calculated for males & females separately

-   Using structural equation modeling (SEM), variance of phenotypes separated into additive genetic (A), common environmental (C), & unique environmental influences (E)

### Findings:

-   NOPE -- your genes don't determine your political party

BUT!

-   Genes play a pivotal role in the strength of your party ID

### General notes:

-   Direction and Intensity of Political Affiliation

    -   Family member political affiliations are highly correlated

        -   Largely held as evidence of familial socialization

        -   Researchers have failed to consider possibility of genetic component

    -   Other social traits, behaviors, and attitudes are genetically influenced

        -   Church attendance

        -   Issue positions

        -   Political ideology (isn't this what we're already talking about?)

    -   We need to know both direction and strength of partisan attachments

-   Behavior Genetics and Biometric Theory

    -   Developed in an attempt to understand why individuals in a population differ

        -   Analyses explain variation around a population mean = info on individual differences in a population

        -   Phenotype (specific trait value) = combo of genetics + environment

        -   Monozygotic (MZ) twins often used in behavior genetic pop samples

        -   If PID is influenced by genes, co-twin correlation of MZ twins should be higher than that of DZ twin pairs

    -   Maximum likelihood (ML) structural equation modeling (SEM) most commonly used to analyze twin samples (Bayesian also used)

        -   Tests validity of theories

-   Model Assumptions and Addressing Critics of Biometric Designs

    -   Classical Twin Design (CTD) assumes no differences in means (or prevalences) and variances of different zygosity groups

    -   Also assumes magnitude and correlation of shared environmental influences are the same for MZ and DZ co-twin pairs ("equal environment assumption")

    -   Current polysci critiques outdated a priori assumptions that don't test predictions

    -   "The heuristic that genes influence behavior is unashamedly empirical, because that is the nature of science" (586).

    -   Limitations exist:

        -   Twin samples are not random

-   Describing the Sample and the Measurement of Concepts

    -   Data collected in mid- to late 1980s as part of Virginia 30,000 Health and Life-Style Survey for Twins (VA30K)

    -   PID assessed by survey question: "Write in the number which best describes \[your\] political affiliation: (1) don't know (2) always supports Republicans (3) usually supports Republicans (4) varies (5) usually supports Democrats (6) always supports Democrats (7) other (8) prefer not to answer."

        -   2 or 3 = Republican, 5 or 6 = Democrat, 4 = varies

        -   Partisan intensity determined by usually and always

    -   Sociodemographic variables: age, income, education, religion, occupation, marital status, church attendance

    -   Political attitudes assessed using 28-item version of [Wilson-Patterson attitudes inventory](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8260.1968.tb00568.x)

        -   Selection of covariates for partisan intensity include measures from Eysenck's Personality Quotient (EPQ) with 3 main personality factors:

            -   Psychoticism (versus impulse control)

            -   Extraversion (versus introversion)

            -   Neuroticism (versus instability)

        -   Two additional subfactors -- impulsivity and social conformity -- also in sample and included in analysis

### Definitions:

-   Monozygotic (MZ) twins = twins developed from a single fertilized ovum that are genetically identical

-   Dizygotic (DZ) twins = twins from 2 different fertilized ova by different sperm; on average only sharing 50% of segregating genes (like non-twin siblings)

-   Additive genetic (A) = combined influence of all genes

-   Common environment (C) = common or shared among family members, including familial and cultural socialization

-   Unique environment (E) = idiosyncratic (unique) personal experience and all environmental stimuli unique to the individual

-   A priori = knowledge independent from experience

-   Collapsed variable = combining several cases into single lines

-   Polychoric correlation = A technique for estimating the correlation between two hypothesized normally distributed continuous latent (indirectly measured) variables, from two observed ordinal variables

-   Discriminant function analyses = serve the same purpose as beta weights in linear regression and indicate the relative importance of the covariate in predicting the dependent variable

# Week 5: Vote Choice - Socio-Contextual Mechanisms

### Arzheimer, Kai. 2009. "Contextual Factors and the Extreme Right Vote in Western Europe, 1980-2002." *American Journal of Political Science* 53(2): 259-275.

### Huber, John, Georgia Kernell and Eduardo Leoni. 2003. "Institutional Context, Cognitive Resources, and Party Attachments Across Democracies." *Political Analysis* 13(4): 365-386.

### Bumper Sticker:

Party attachment follows from group identities when:

-   The individual identifies as a member of the group
-   Competing group identities are both in support of the same party.
-   (also) Systems that help individuals evaluate party performance increase partisanship and this effect is most strongly associated with the least-educated individuals.

### Independent Variable:

salience of groups, group cross pressures, & permissiveness of electoral system 

-   measured through social heterogeneity, number of political parties, effective number of legislative parties

-   Retrospective clarity:

    -   Effective number of legislative parties (as this increases, more difficult to assess responsibility for policy outcomes

    -   Party cohesion (vote for candidate captures degree of interdependence between voting for a candidate and the candidate's party)

    -   Candidate control of ballot (captures candidates' control of (1) access to a party's label and (2) manipulation of ballot rankings in party list systems

    -   Age of party system (logged and weighted by vote proportion age of up to the top 6 vote-receiving parties in CSES election)

-   Education:

    -   1 (low) to 8 (high)

### Dependent Variable:

Party attachment

### Research Question:

Do some political systems encourage the formation of party attachments more than others? Are social structures or governmental institutions most important? Are the effects of political context the same for all individuals?

### Hypothesis:

-   A country's social and institutional context should have a systematic impact on party attachments.

-   The impact of social and institutional context does not operate the same on all types of individuals.

### Data:

-   Countries with a 9 or 10 on Polity IV for at least the 2 years immediately prior to first module of that country's CSES election survey (1996-201) = 25 countries (Thailand removed for corruption-plagued 2001 election)

-   Party attachment measured by answers to 2 CSES questions:

    -   "Do you usually think of yourself as close to any particular political party?"

    -   If yes, "What party is that" = party attachment; if no, = independents

### Methods:

-   Two-step estimation procedure:

    -   Probit model for each country estimating effects of individual-level attributes on likelihood of being a partisan

    -   Linear regression to test socialization and institutional hypotheses with weighting matrix to weight coefficients from first-level regressions by their precision

### Findings:

-   Voters form attachments when group identities are salient and complimentary.

-   Institutions that help voters evaluate parties increase partisanship.

    -   These institutions retrospectively evaluate parties through party discipline and the number of parties in government.

    -   These institutions have the greatest influence on voters with the least education.

### Pattie, Charles, and Ron Johnston. 2000. "People Who Talk Together Vote Together: An Exploration of Contextual Effects in Great Britain." *Annals of the Association of American Geographers* 90(1): 41-66.

### Abstract:

Many students of British voting patterns have tested for the existence of contextual effects, which postulate that voters are influenced by events and people in their local milieux. One of those contextual effects is the neighborhood effect, whereby individuals are influenced by the nature of the politically relevant information circulating within their social networks, many of which are spatiallyconstrained to their local area. Although ecological analyses have identified patterns consistent with this hypothesis, there have been virtually no direct investigations of the effect, largely because of the absence of relevant data. Using information from a large, clustered survey of voters at the time of the 1992 general election, this paper uncovers clear evidence of such effects: people are much more likely to change their votes in a particular direction if those with whom they discuss political issues support that direction, especially if they are members of the respondent's family and are the individuals with whom they discuss politics most.

### Bumper Sticker:

Who we talk to is as important as who we are and who we talk to is very much influenced by where we live --- we are what we are, and do what we do, because of where we are, and have been **OR** those who talk together tend to vote together.

### Research Question:

Does the neighborhood effect have an impact on voter decisions?

### Summary/Theory/Argument:

Most researchers have accepted that voters are influence by their immediate social and geographical environments as well as their own individual circumstances. However, the way in which such contextual factors operate is contested. Most explanations point to spatial variation in economic and political contexts and the driving force behind voter's decisions. That is, "nonsocial" context on economic and political conditions at the local and national level compose the voting repertoire with which individuals draw on at the polls.

However, the authors speculate that the influence of immediate social networks (family, friends, colleagues) on individual opinions informs their voting behavior. Early research explored such possibilities, but scarcity of data left this "neighborhood effect" to be abandoned if favor of explanations that could be explored.

### Hypothesis:

Main hypothesis: Each group would be influenced by the dominant nature of electorally relevant information in their social networks---those who changed the party that they supported should be in networks where support for their new party is strong, whereas those who remained loyal to a party should be in networks that give it strong support.

### Data/Methods:

-   Explores contextual effects on voting behavior in Great Britain

-   Uses data collected in the British Election Study (BES) from the 1992 British General Election, which lends itself to the data requirement of networks of people living in the same locality.

    -   The data uses a cluster rather than a random sample: 210 "points" (which are polling districts made up of 1,000-2,000 voters).

    -   Used a stratified random design with a random sample of respondents selected from the electoral roll for the district

    -   Produces 2,526 individuals with an average sample size of around 16 per cluster, with a peaked distribution between 16 and 19

-   Authors chose to focus on why some respondents, from their own recollection, changed their vote between 1987 and 1992 while others did not

-   By aggregating the reported 1987 votes of each BES respondent by polling district, the authors were able to estimate the vote share there for each of the three main political parties that fought in all British constituencies in both 1987 and 1992: Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat (Alliance in 1987).

-   **First analysis:**

    -   Contrasts those who switched their vote to a particular party in 1992 (coded 1) against those who didn't (coded 0)

    -   Gives 3 dependent variables:

        -   1\. switch to conservative 2) switch to labor 3) switch to Liberal

    -   Employs a Logistic Regression (because the DVs are binary)

    -   Then does the same thing but looks at those who defected (voted for each party in 1987) So those who voted for a particular party in 1987 and again in 1992 (the loyalists) against those that voted for another party/ didn't vote at all in 1992 (the defectors)

-   **Second analysis:**

    -   looks at the impact of conversations with the individuals respondents named as the first (primary) discussant of politics and analyzing how that affected transitions to each party

    -   Measures those who who didn't vote for the same party in 1992 as they did in 1987 against those who did

    -   Also looks at those who defected versus those who didn't

-   **Third analysis:**

    -   Assesses the degree to which cross cutting relationships impact vote choice by bringing in two additional discussants that the respondents listed

    -   The more discussants who support a particular party, the greater the expected probability that an individual will switch to that party, and the less the probability that he or she will defect from it.

-   **Fourth analysis:**

    -   It's possible that discussants don't live in the same neighborhood (i.e. context) as the respondent. Therefore, there a chance that political context and conversations on voting linked, or could they be separate?

    -   hypothesize that the more support a party has in a locality (the independent variables employed in the regressions reported in Tables 3 and 4), the greater the probability that individuals there will encounter, talk to, and be converted by that party's partisans

    -   tested by dividing the respondents according to how many discussants they report having a particular partisanship, which can vary from 0 to 3.

### Findings:

-   Social networks are indeed important influences on voting decisions

    -   Families who talk together, vote together! (kinda) - voters were more likely to vote/not vote for a party based on conversations they had with their families

    -   More accurately: those who talked together tended to vote together.

    -   Conversations with friends are also important

-   **First analysis:**

    -   the more their local area was dominated by supporters of a particular party, the greater the probability that individuals switched their support to that party between 1987 and 1992---if they had not voted for it at the first of those two election

    -   local context did not influence voters' decisions to abandon a party they have previously supported, but that the choice of which party to switch their support to was influenced by local conditions---which is the hypothesized mechanism that underlies the neighborhood effect.

-   **Second analysis:**

    -   Those who did not voter conservative in 1987 were more likely to vote conservative in 1992 if their primary discussant was conservative

        -   talking to Labour or Liberal party discussants made not conservative voters less likely to vote conservative (duh)

    -   Same results hold for other parties - voters were more likely to vote for a particular party if the primary discussant was a member of that party

    -   Frequency of conversation about politics appeared to have no influence

    -   those people who voted for a party in 1987 were less likely to vote for another party in 1992 if their primary discussant had been a supporter of the same parter when compared to their discussant being from another party or having no discussant at all

-   **Third analysis:**

    -   More likely to support and less likely to defect if the discussants were from the same party

-   **Fourth Analysis:**

    -   If a respondent had more discussants from a particular party, then there was also an associated increase in the number of votes for that party in the respondents district

    -   This shows that there is a link between spatial and communicative contexts, supporting the neighboring effects.

-   It is not logical to ignore social networks, and conversations within them, as a possible influence on the voting decision of individuals

### Non-Findings:

-   Can't distinguish if the influential conversations are locally based

-   They know that the conversations matter, but they have no information on the relative locations of the individuals involved in those conversations (how immediate are they?).

-   Also don't know what the content of the conversations were

# Week 6: Vote Choice - Economic Motivations

## Bratten, Michael, and Robert Mattes. 2001. "Support for Democracy in Africa: Intrinsic or Instrumental?" British Journal of Political Science 31(3): 447-474.

### Bumper Sticker:

African democracy persists b/c of economic AND political change.

### Independent Variable:

economic, political, and general performance factors on democratic regime

### Dependent Variable:

attitudes about democracy

### Research Question:

Why do Africans support democracy?

### Hypothesis:

-   Explanatory factors: why variation in support for/satisfaction with democracy?

    -   Social characteristics of population such as literacy, income and gender

    -   Economic goods: popular perceptions of national economic conditions, personal quality of life, and access to materials and services shape feelings about democracy

    -   Political goods: Is the delivery of civil rights and political equality enough?

    -   General performance factors: citizens' overall assessment of governmental performance for 3 reasons:

### Data:

-   3 separate surveys on political attitudes in Ghana, Zambia, and South Africa

    -   Zambia: 1,182 respondents following "dubious" 1996 election

    -   South Africa: 3,500 stratified by race, province, community size in 1997 following free & fair elections

    -   Ghana: 2,005 respondents in 1999 following free & fair 1996 elections

        -   All 3 surveys included questions on citizen understanding of the meaning of democracy, support for, and satisfaction with democracy in theory and n practice

### Methods:

Multiple regression in OLS

### Findings:

Popular support for democracy in African countries similar to other Third Wave countries

-   Lower levels of mass satisfaction w/regime performance in African countries

-   General public in African countries thinks instrumentally: support for democracy hinges critically upon popular approval of government achievements

-   Outside of South Africa, many Africans value political goods

**Additional findings:**

1.  Africans \[here\] more likely to associate democracy w/individual liberties than w/communal solidarity, especially if they live in urban areas.

2.  Popular conceptions of democracy have both procedural and substantive dimensions (though the former is more common than the latter).

3.  Citizens rank procedural and substantive attributes in different order across countries.

4.  Rankings differ even within the category of political goods

### Abstract:

This article examines recent trends in #Latin-American #voting-behavior and casts them in terms of sincere (economic) and strategic (electoral) concerns. It argues that thanks to years of economic adversity, Latin Americans have developed long, sophisticated #economic-memories . Although this has resulted in rising frustration with democratic government, according to recent opinion polls, it has not always led voters to #punish all parties responsible for hardship at election time. A panel study of the region's presidential systems demonstrates that citizens punish incumbents by voting for established #nonincumbents when electoral laws reduce opportunities available to small parties in the systems, even if #nonincumbents have also been blamed for hard economic times. More #permissive-electoral-systems , in contrast, encourage citizens to reject all parties responsible for economic decline. The analysis demonstrates how economic and electoral concerns interact to affect voting behavior, #political-accountability , and #public-opinion in Latin America.

Economic Evaluations Voter Laws Voter Behavior

### Research Question:

If most Latin Americans have faced economic hardship during successive governments, why do they reject both the incumbent and non-incumbent parties in some systems and only the incumbent party in others?

### Summary/Theory/Argument:

Many Latin American economies have experienced some form poor performance that has resulted in different forms of electoral punishment. Barton, drawing on previous literature regarding economic theories of voter behavior, devises a theory that enables her to assess the institutional features that interact with economic performance to determine who voters choose to punish in subsequent elections. In highly permissible systems, where there are more parties to choose from, voters memories of economic performance can interact with electoral strategies to allow the punishment of multiple parties (as has been the case in multiple countries). However, more restrictive systems, which limit the number of viable parties, forces voters to focus their punishing efforts on the incumbent alone, as they require an alternative option of some form and therefore increases support for the form incumbent.

### Data/Methods:

-   panel data from 13 Latin American Countries

    -   required (a) to be a presidential system and have had (b) more than one party win the presidency, so that current and former incumbents compete; (c) to have elections deemed free of fraud by international observers, so that their results reflect voters' reactions to party performance; and (d) to have an economic crisis and/or economic reform during democratic rule.

    -   in these countries, 64 elections were held, with 39 instances in which current and former incumbents competed for power

### Independent Variable:

economic performance as measured by the percentage change in GDP per capita during each parties last 2 years in office.

### Dependent Variable:

-   Change in support for incumbents - measured as the difference between votes received by an incumbent party in presidential elections while in office and votes received in the previous election when the party won.

-   Change in support for non-incumbents out of power - measured as change in support received in elections after leaving office and support when the party originally came into power.

### Model:

-   Uses OLS with #panel-corrected standard errors #PCSEs , which were selected because of the limited number of countries and small (often unbalanced) number of observations in each panel.

### Hypothesis:

-   **H1:** When incumbent parties are blamed for poor economic performance, they will lose support, regardless of the electoral system used to elect them.

-   **H2:** Nonincumbent parties previously in power will derive greater electoral benefits in restrictive, compared with permissive, electoral contexts when incumbent parties are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.

-   **H3:** Former incumbents blamed for economic decline will continue to receive lower levels of support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts, all else being equal.

-   **H4:** Current incumbents will gain support in permissive, as opposed to restrictive, electoral contexts when former incumbents are blamed for economic decline, all else being equal.

### Findings:

| Hypothesis | Support | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| H1         | Yes     | incumbent parties' support decreases with economic downturns, without regard to institutional change (p.430)                                                                                                                                                                                |
| H2         | Yes     | when electoral laws construct institutional barriers to small parties (restrictive), groups once holding the presidency will suffer losses in support when incumbents manage economic growth; as GDP declines, parties previously in power begin to experience a surge of supprot (p.431)   |
| H3         | Yes     | accounting for the presence of Honduras, there was no relationship between poor economic performance and punishment of former incumbents in restrictive systems; there was a relationship between poor economic performance and the punishment of incumbents in permissive systems (pg.436) |
| H4         | Yes     | nonincumbents' performance has implications for incumbents' support. As predicted, incumbents gain about 10% of the national votes when nonincumbents are responsible for neoliberal economic reform in all electoral settings                                                              |

### Other Findings:

-   Restrictive institutions reduce the incentive for voters to waste support on parties unlikely to win.

-   Rather than helping nonincumbents weather the electoral effect of incumbents' economic growth, runoffs cause nonincumbents to suffer additional electoral losses.

### Bumper Sticker:

The state of the economy can help predict voter decisions.

### Purpose:

This is a literature review on micro-level, survey research studies of economic voting in the U.S., Britain, France, and Globally.

### Overview:

Questions regarding the precise nature of economic voting led to four general "types".

1.  Retrospective Voting
    1.  Originating with V.O. Key (1966), this type of voting occurs when voters review the performance of the incumbent government.
2.  Prospective Voting
    1.  Originating with Downs (1957), this type of voting occurs when voters look to the future and vote according to the governments potential economic performance.
3.  Pocketbook Voting (personal finances)
    1.  This theory of voting suggests that when personal or household financial conditions have deteriorated, voters will punish the incumbent.
4.  Sociotropic Voting (national economy rather than personal finances).
    1.  This theory of voting suggests that voters are more likely to be considering the national economic situation when casting their vote.

Of these types, the retrospective sociotropic and prospective sociotropic appear to be the most relevant across empirical evaluations. That is, people tend to vote based of their perceptions of national economic performance, both in the past (retrospective sociotropic) and the future (prospective sociotropic). The type of voting that is cued depends on whether or not an incumbent is running, and therefore a reliable place to point blame. Essentially, the reward-punishment hypothesis holds up across settings, with slight variation according to group membership (party id, gender, etc.), institutional context (voting system, prime-minister v. president, number of parties) and economic context (personal, neighborhood, national).

### Findings:

#### United States:

-   ANES is good source for election studies
-   Most theories of economic voting focus on the U.S.
-   Pocketbook voting is weak in presidential elections \-- sociotropic is strong
-   Strength of economic voting can cary based on context \-- such is the case when considering the attribution of responsibility (e.g. the attribution of blame to particular party/candidate/branch of government)
    -   in the U.S. the presidency is an important institutional context for which to blame punish electorally
-   While other types of factors matter and interact them, sociotropic economic effects (both retrospective and prospective) themselves cannot be understated when assessing the general behavior of the voter population.

#### Britain:

-   BES is a good source for election studies
-   British voters show the same trends of reward and punishment regarding economic voting
-   There may be important regional contexts
    -   Johnston 1997 finds that when voter's perceptions of their neighborhoods are that they are worse off, they will punish the incumbent
-   Retrospective and Prospective are both important
-   Perceptual shifts in economic conditions are almost as great as realigning with a different party (Clarke et al. 2004)

#### France:

-   Eurobarometer and FNES are good sources for election studies
-   A general finding---significant retrospective sociotropic effects, but no retrospective pocketbook effects
-   It is largely sociotropic and more or less equally retrospective or prospective, depending in part on the institutional context.
-   The French voter is sophisticated, knowing whom and how much to blame.
    -   When government is unified, the president is the lightning rod for economic discontent. However, under cohabitation, the burden shifts to the prime minister.
-   Smaller parties are blamed less than large parties, legislative candidates are blamed less than presidential candidates, and presidential candidates who are prime minister are blamed more than presidential candidates who are not prime minister.

#### Cross-National Studies:

-   Similar trends have been found in cross-national studies
    -   Lewis‐Beck and Mitchell (1990), on the five major western European countries; Chappell and Veiga (2000), on thirteen western European nations; Pacek (1994) and Tucker (2001) on central European samples; Remmer (1991) on twelve Latin American countries; Pacek and Radcli (1995) on eight low‐income nations; Wilkin, Haller, and Norporth (1997) on a worldwide sample of countries.
-   Important Takeaways:
    -   Responsibility Hypothesis seems to hold - that when responsibility is hard to pin down, voters are less likely to punish incumbents - this is an important contextual factors

        -   Such is the case in more countries with more "coalitional complexity" \-- when more parties make up the incumbent government, is it difficult to assign blame

        -   Presidential Systems and systems with more restrictive electoral laws tend to strengthen the economic vote

        -   In the context of globalization, there is a significant decrease in economic voting in the face of open trade, as electorates can't assign blame to the government alone
